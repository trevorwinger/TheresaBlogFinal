But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war,<br>if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that<br>Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing<br>more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my<br>‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I<br>have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.”<br><br>It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna<br>Schérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna.<br>With these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high<br>rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna<br>Pávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering<br>from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used<br>only by the elite.<br><br>All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered<br>by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:<br><br>“If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the<br>prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,<br>I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette<br>Schérer.”<br><br>“Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the<br>least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an<br>embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on<br>his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that<br>refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and<br>with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance<br>who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna,<br>kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,<br>and complacently seated himself on the sofa.<br><br>“First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s<br>mind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the<br>politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony<br>could be discerned.<br><br>“Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times<br>like these if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You are<br>staying the whole evening, I hope?”<br><br>“And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I<br>must put in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is<br>coming for me to take me there.”<br><br>“I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I confess all these<br>festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.”<br><br>“If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have<br>been put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force<br>of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.<br><br>“Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev’s<br>dispatch? You know everything.”<br><br>“What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless<br>tone. “What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has<br>burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.”<br><br>Prince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale<br>part. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years,<br>overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had<br>become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not<br>feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the<br>expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it<br>did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,<br>as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,<br>which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to<br>correct.<br><br>In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burst<br>out:<br><br>“Oh, don’t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don’t understand<br>things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She<br>is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign<br>recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one<br>thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform<br>the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will<br>not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of<br>revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of<br>this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just<br>one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial<br>spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander’s<br>loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to<br>find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer<br>did Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot<br>understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for<br>himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they<br>promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not<br>perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and<br>that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don’t believe a<br>word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian<br>neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty<br>destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!”<br><br>She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.<br><br>“I think,” said the prince with a smile, “that if you had been<br>sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King<br>of Prussia’s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me<br>a cup of tea?”<br><br>“In a moment. À propos,” she added, becoming calm again, “I am<br>expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who<br>is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best<br>French families. He is one of the genuine émigrés, the good ones. And<br>also the Abbé Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been<br>received by the Emperor. Had you heard?”<br><br>“I shall be delighted to meet them,” said the prince. “But<br>tell me,” he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just<br>occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief<br>motive of his visit, “is it true that the Dowager Empress wants<br>Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all<br>accounts is a poor creature.”<br><br>Prince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were<br>trying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it for<br>the baron.<br><br>Anna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor<br>anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was<br>pleased with.<br><br>“Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her<br>sister,” was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.<br><br>As she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna’s face suddenly assumed an<br>expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with<br>sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious<br>patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke<br>beaucoup d’estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.<br><br>The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and<br>courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovna<br>wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man<br>recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she<br>said:<br><br>“Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came<br>out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly<br>beautiful.”<br><br>The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.<br><br>“I often think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer<br>to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political<br>and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate<br>conversation—“I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life<br>are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children?<br>I don’t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don’t like him,” she<br>added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.<br>“Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than<br>anyone, and so you don’t deserve to have them.”<br><br>And she smiled her ecstatic smile.<br><br>“I can’t help it,” said the prince. “Lavater would have said I<br>lack the bump of paternity.”<br><br>“Don’t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know<br>I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves” (and her<br>face assumed its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at Her<br>Majesty’s and you were pitied....”<br><br>The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,<br>awaiting a reply. He frowned.<br><br>“What would you have me do?” he said at last. “You know I did all<br>a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.<br>Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That<br>is the only difference between them.” He said this smiling in a way<br>more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round<br>his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and<br>unpleasant.<br><br>“And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a<br>father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,” said Anna<br>Pávlovna, looking up pensively.<br><br>“I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my<br>children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That<br>is how I explain it to myself. It can’t be helped!”<br><br>He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a<br>gesture. Anna Pávlovna meditated.<br><br>“Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?” she<br>asked. “They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I<br>don’t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who<br>is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess<br>Mary Bolkónskaya.”<br><br>Prince Vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and<br>perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of<br>the head that he was considering this information.<br><br>“Do you know,” he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad<br>current of his thoughts, “that Anatole is costing me forty thousand<br>rubles a year? And,” he went on after a pause, “what will it be in<br>five years, if he goes on like this?” Presently he added: “That’s<br>what we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours<br>rich?”<br><br>“Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is<br>the well-known Prince Bolkónski who had to retire from the army under<br>the late Emperor, and was nicknamed ‘the King of Prussia.’ He is<br>very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy.<br>She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately.<br>He is an aide-de-camp of Kutúzov’s and will be here tonight.”<br><br>“Listen, dear Annette,” said the prince, suddenly taking Anna<br>Pávlovna’s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. “Arrange<br>that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe<br>with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich<br>and of good family and that’s all I want.”<br><br>And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the<br>maid of honor’s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro<br>as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.<br><br>“Attendez,” said Anna Pávlovna, reflecting, “I’ll speak to<br>Lise, young Bolkónski’s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the<br>thing can be arranged. It shall be on your family’s behalf that I’ll<br>start my apprenticeship as old maid.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest<br>Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age<br>and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.<br>Prince Vasíli’s daughter, the beautiful Hélène, came to take her<br>father to the ambassador’s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and<br>her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess Bolkónskaya,<br>known as la femme la plus séduisante de Pétersbourg, * was also there.<br>She had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did<br>not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince<br>Vasíli’s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced.<br>The Abbé Morio and many others had also come.<br><br>     * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.<br><br>To each new arrival Anna Pávlovna said, “You have not yet seen my<br>aunt,” or “You do not know my aunt?” and very gravely conducted<br>him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her<br>cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests<br>began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her<br>aunt, Anna Pávlovna mentioned each one’s name and then left them.<br><br>Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not<br>one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them<br>cared about; Anna Pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and<br>solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in<br>the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her<br>Majesty, “who, thank God, was better today.” And each visitor,<br>though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman<br>with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not<br>return to her the whole evening.<br><br>The young Princess Bolkónskaya had brought some work in a<br>gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a<br>delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth,<br>but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she<br>occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case<br>with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect—the shortness of her<br>upper lip and her half-open mouth—seemed to be her own special and<br>peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty<br>young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and<br>carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones<br>who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a<br>little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life<br>and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile<br>and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a<br>specially amiable mood that day.<br><br>The little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying<br>steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat<br>down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a<br>pleasure to herself and to all around her. “I have brought my work,”<br>said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present.<br>“Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,”<br>she added, turning to her hostess. “You wrote that it was to be quite<br>a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.” And she<br>spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray<br>dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.<br><br>“Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone<br>else,” replied Anna Pávlovna.<br><br>“You know,” said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in<br>French, turning to a general, “my husband is deserting me? He is going<br>to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?” she<br>added, addressing Prince Vasíli, and without waiting for an answer she<br>turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Hélène.<br><br>“What a delightful woman this little princess is!” said Prince<br>Vasíli to Anna Pávlovna.<br><br>One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with<br>close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable<br>at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout<br>young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov, a well-known<br>grandee of Catherine’s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man<br>had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only<br>just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his<br>first appearance in society. Anna Pávlovna greeted him with the nod she<br>accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of<br>this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight<br>of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face<br>when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than<br>the other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to<br>the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which<br>distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.<br><br>“It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor<br>invalid,” said Anna Pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her<br>aunt as she conducted him to her.<br><br>Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as<br>if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little<br>princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.<br><br>Anna Pávlovna’s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the<br>aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty’s health.<br>Anna Pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words: “Do you know the<br>Abbé Morio? He is a most interesting man.”<br><br>“Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very<br>interesting but hardly feasible.”<br><br>“You think so?” rejoined Anna Pávlovna in order to say something<br>and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now<br>committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before<br>she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to<br>another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet<br>spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbé’s<br>plan chimerical.<br><br>“We will talk of it later,” said Anna Pávlovna with a smile.<br><br>And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she<br>resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready<br>to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As<br>the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes<br>round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that<br>creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the<br>machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pávlovna moved about her<br>drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a<br>word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady,<br>proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about<br>Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached<br>the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and<br>again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbé.<br><br>Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna<br>Pávlovna’s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all<br>the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a<br>child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing<br>any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident<br>and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always<br>expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio.<br>Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an<br>opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>Anna Pávlovna’s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed<br>steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,<br>beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face<br>was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had<br>settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round<br>the abbé. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful<br>Princess Hélène, Prince Vasíli’s daughter, and the little Princess<br>Bolkónskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age.<br>The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pávlovna.<br><br>The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished<br>manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of<br>politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in<br>which he found himself. Anna Pávlovna was obviously serving him up as<br>a treat to her guests. As a clever maître d’hôtel serves up as a<br>specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in<br>the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna served up to<br>her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbé, as peculiarly choice<br>morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the<br>murder of the Duc d’Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d’Enghien<br>had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular<br>reasons for Buonaparte’s hatred of him.<br><br>“Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,” said Anna Pávlovna,<br>with a pleasant feeling that there was something à la Louis XV in the<br>sound of that sentence: “Contez nous çela, Vicomte.”<br><br>The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to<br>comply. Anna Pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to<br>listen to his tale.<br><br>“The vicomte knew the duc personally,” whispered Anna Pávlovna to<br>one of the guests. “The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,” said she<br>to another. “How evidently he belongs to the best society,” said she<br>to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest<br>and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef<br>on a hot dish.<br><br>The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.<br><br>“Come over here, Hélène, dear,” said Anna Pávlovna to the<br>beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of<br>another group.<br><br>The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which<br>she had first entered the room—the smile of a perfectly beautiful<br>woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss<br>and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling<br>diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking<br>at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the<br>privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders,<br>back, and bosom—which in the fashion of those days were very much<br>exposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as<br>she moved toward Anna Pávlovna. Hélène was so lovely that not only<br>did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even<br>appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She<br>seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.<br><br>“How lovely!” said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his<br>shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary<br>when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her<br>unchanging smile.<br><br>“Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,” said he,<br>smilingly inclining his head.<br><br>The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered<br>a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was<br>being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,<br>altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more<br>beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time<br>to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story<br>produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted just<br>the expression she saw on the maid of honor’s face, and again relapsed<br>into her radiant smile.<br><br>The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène.<br><br>“Wait a moment, I’ll get my work.... Now then, what are you<br>thinking of?” she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. “Fetch me my<br>workbag.”<br><br>There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking<br>merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her<br>seat.<br><br>“Now I am all right,” she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she<br>took up her work.<br><br>Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and<br>moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.<br><br>Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance<br>to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of<br>this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his<br>sister’s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous,<br>self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the<br>wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary<br>was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen<br>self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and<br>mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms<br>and legs always fell into unnatural positions.<br><br>“It’s not going to be a ghost story?” said he, sitting down beside<br>the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this<br>instrument he could not begin to speak.<br><br>“Why no, my dear fellow,” said the astonished narrator, shrugging<br>his shoulders.<br><br>“Because I hate ghost stories,” said Prince Hippolyte in a tone<br>which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he<br>had uttered them.<br><br>He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure<br>whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in<br>a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe<br>effrayée, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.<br><br>The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current,<br>to the effect that the Duc d’Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to<br>visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte,<br>who also enjoyed the famous actress’ favors, and that in his presence<br>Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was<br>subject, and was thus at the duc’s mercy. The latter spared him, and<br>this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.<br><br>The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point<br>where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked<br>agitated.<br><br>“Charming!” said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the<br>little princess.<br><br>“Charming!” whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into<br>her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story<br>prevented her from going on with it.<br><br>The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully<br>prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept a<br>watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was<br>talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to the<br>rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbé about<br>the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young<br>man’s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both<br>were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why<br>Anna Pávlovna disapproved.<br><br>“The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of<br>the people,” the abbé was saying. “It is only necessary for one<br>powerful nation like Russia—barbaric as she is said to be—to place<br>herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object<br>the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the<br>world!”<br><br>“But how are you to get that balance?” Pierre was beginning.<br><br>At that moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,<br>asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian’s<br>face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary<br>expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.<br><br>“I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the<br>society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had<br>the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of<br>the climate,” said he.<br><br>Not letting the abbé and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna, the more<br>conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the<br>larger circle.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew<br>Bolkónski, the little princess’ husband. He was a very handsome young<br>man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about<br>him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step,<br>offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was<br>evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had<br>found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to<br>them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed<br>to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from<br>her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna<br>Pávlovna’s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.<br><br>“You are off to the war, Prince?” said Anna Pávlovna.<br><br>“General Kutúzov,” said Bolkónski, speaking French and stressing<br>the last syllable of the general’s name like a Frenchman, “has been<br>pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....”<br><br>“And Lise, your wife?”<br><br>“She will go to the country.”<br><br>“Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?”<br><br>“André,” said his wife, addressing her husband in the same<br>coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, “the vicomte has<br>been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!”<br><br>Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from<br>the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,<br>affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round<br>Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was<br>touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre’s beaming face he gave him an<br>unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.<br><br>“There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?” said he to<br>Pierre.<br><br>“I knew you would be here,” replied Pierre. “I will come to supper<br>with you. May I?” he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the<br>vicomte who was continuing his story.<br><br>“No, impossible!” said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing<br>Pierre’s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He<br>wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasíli and his<br>daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.<br><br>“You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,” said Prince Vasíli to the<br>Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent<br>his rising. “This unfortunate fete at the ambassador’s deprives me<br>of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave<br>your enchanting party,” said he, turning to Anna Pávlovna.<br><br>His daughter, Princess Hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly<br>holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more<br>radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,<br>almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.<br><br>“Very lovely,” said Prince Andrew.<br><br>“Very,” said Pierre.<br><br>In passing Prince Vasíli seized Pierre’s hand and said to Anna<br>Pávlovna: “Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me<br>a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society.<br>Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever<br>women.”<br><br><br>Anna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his<br>father to be a connection of Prince Vasíli’s. The elderly lady who<br>had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince<br>Vasíli in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed<br>had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety<br>and fear.<br><br>“How about my son Borís, Prince?” said she, hurrying after him into<br>the anteroom. “I can’t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what<br>news I may take back to my poor boy.”<br><br>Although Prince Vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely<br>to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an<br>ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go<br>away.<br><br>“What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he<br>would be transferred to the Guards at once?” said she.<br><br>“Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,” answered Prince<br>Vasíli, “but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should<br>advise you to appeal to Rumyántsev through Prince Golítsyn. That would<br>be the best way.”<br><br>The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskáya, belonging to one of the<br>best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of<br>society had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to<br>Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son.<br>It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasíli that she had obtained an<br>invitation to Anna Pávlovna’s reception and had sat listening to<br>the vicomte’s story. Prince Vasíli’s words frightened her, an<br>embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment;<br>then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vasíli’s arm more tightly.<br><br>“Listen to me, Prince,” said she. “I have never yet asked you<br>for anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my<br>father’s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God’s sake to<br>do this for my son—and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,”<br>she added hurriedly. “No, don’t be angry, but promise! I have asked<br>Golítsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,”<br>she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.<br><br>“Papa, we shall be late,” said Princess Hélène, turning her<br>beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she<br>stood waiting by the door.<br><br>Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized<br>if it is to last. Prince Vasíli knew this, and having once realized<br>that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be<br>unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But<br>in Princess Drubetskáya’s case he felt, after her second appeal,<br>something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what was<br>quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in<br>his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of<br>those women—mostly mothers—who, having once made up their minds,<br>will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if<br>necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even<br>to make scenes. This last consideration moved him.<br><br>“My dear Anna Mikháylovna,” said he with his usual familiarity and<br>weariness of tone, “it is almost impossible for me to do what you<br>ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father’s<br>memory, I will do the impossible—your son shall be transferred to the<br>Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?”<br><br>“My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you—I knew your<br>kindness!” He turned to go.<br><br>“Wait—just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...”<br>she faltered. “You are on good terms with Michael Ilariónovich<br>Kutúzov ... recommend Borís to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at<br>rest, and then...”<br><br>Prince Vasíli smiled.<br><br>“No, I won’t promise that. You don’t know how Kutúzov is pestered<br>since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that<br>all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as<br>adjutants.”<br><br>“No, but do promise! I won’t let you go! My dear benefactor...”<br><br>“Papa,” said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before,<br>“we shall be late.”<br><br>“Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?”<br><br>“Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?”<br><br>“Certainly; but about Kutúzov, I don’t promise.”<br><br>“Do promise, do promise, Vasíli!” cried Anna Mikháylovna as he<br>went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably<br>came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.<br><br>Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed<br>all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face<br>resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the<br>group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to<br>listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was<br>accomplished.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>“And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at<br>Milan?” asked Anna Pávlovna, “and of the comedy of the people of<br>Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and<br>Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of<br>the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one’s head whirl! It is as<br>if the whole world had gone crazy.”<br><br>Prince Andrew looked Anna Pávlovna straight in the face with a<br>sarcastic smile.<br><br>“‘Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche!’’ * They say he was<br>very fine when he said that,” he remarked, repeating the words in<br>Italian: “‘Dio mi l’ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!’’<br><br>     * God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!<br><br>“I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run<br>over,” Anna Pávlovna continued. “The sovereigns will not be able to<br>endure this man who is a menace to everything.”<br><br>“The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,” said the vicomte, polite<br>but hopeless: “The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis<br>XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!” and he became<br>more animated. “And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their<br>betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending<br>ambassadors to compliment the usurper.”<br><br>And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.<br><br>Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time<br>through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the<br>little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Condé<br>coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity<br>as if she had asked him to do it.<br><br>“Bâton de gueules, engrêlé de gueules d’azur—maison Condé,”<br>said he.<br><br>The princess listened, smiling.<br><br>“If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,” the<br>vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which<br>he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but<br>follows the current of his own thoughts, “things will have gone too<br>far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society—I<br>mean good French society—will have been forever destroyed, and<br>then....”<br><br>He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to<br>make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pávlovna,<br>who had him under observation, interrupted:<br><br>“The Emperor Alexander,” said she, with the melancholy which<br>always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, “has<br>declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose<br>their own form of government; and I believe that once free from the<br>usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms<br>of its rightful king,” she concluded, trying to be amiable to the<br>royalist emigrant.<br><br>“That is doubtful,” said Prince Andrew. “Monsieur le Vicomte quite<br>rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will<br>be difficult to return to the old regime.”<br><br>“From what I have heard,” said Pierre, blushing and breaking into<br>the conversation, “almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to<br>Bonaparte’s side.”<br><br>“It is the Buonapartists who say that,” replied the vicomte without<br>looking at Pierre. “At the present time it is difficult to know the<br>real state of French public opinion.”<br><br>“Bonaparte has said so,” remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic<br>smile.<br><br>It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his<br>remarks at him, though without looking at him.<br><br>“‘I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow<br>it,’” Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting<br>Napoleon’s words. “‘I opened my antechambers and they crowded<br>in.’ I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.”<br><br>“Not in the least,” replied the vicomte. “After the murder of the<br>duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some<br>people,” he went on, turning to Anna Pávlovna, “he ever was a hero,<br>after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one<br>hero less on earth.”<br><br>Before Anna Pávlovna and the others had time to smile their<br>appreciation of the vicomte’s epigram, Pierre again broke into the<br>conversation, and though Anna Pávlovna felt sure he would say something<br>inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.<br><br>“The execution of the Duc d’Enghien,” declared Monsieur Pierre,<br>“was a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon<br>showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole<br>responsibility of that deed.”<br><br>“Dieu! Mon Dieu!” muttered Anna Pávlovna in a terrified whisper.<br><br>“What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows<br>greatness of soul?” said the little princess, smiling and drawing her<br>work nearer to her.<br><br>“Oh! Oh!” exclaimed several voices.<br><br>“Capital!” said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his<br>knee with the palm of his hand.<br><br>The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his<br>audience over his spectacles and continued.<br><br>“I say so,” he continued desperately, “because the Bourbons fled<br>from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone<br>understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good,<br>he could not stop short for the sake of one man’s life.”<br><br>“Won’t you come over to the other table?” suggested Anna<br>Pávlovna.<br><br>But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.<br><br>“No,” cried he, becoming more and more eager, “Napoleon is great<br>because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses,<br>preserved all that was good in it—equality of citizenship and freedom<br>of speech and of the press—and only for that reason did he obtain<br>power.”<br><br>“Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to<br>commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have<br>called him a great man,” remarked the vicomte.<br><br>“He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might<br>rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great<br>man. The Revolution was a grand thing!” continued Monsieur Pierre,<br>betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme<br>youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.<br><br>“What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that...<br>But won’t you come to this other table?” repeated Anna Pávlovna.<br><br>“Rousseau’s Contrat Social,” said the vicomte with a tolerant<br>smile.<br><br>“I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.”<br><br>“Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,” again interjected an<br>ironical voice.<br><br>“Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most<br>important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from<br>prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon<br>has retained in full force.”<br><br>“Liberty and equality,” said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at<br>last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words<br>were, “high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does<br>not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and<br>equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the<br>contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.”<br><br>Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the<br>vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of<br>Pierre’s outburst Anna Pávlovna, despite her social experience, was<br>horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre’s sacrilegious words<br>had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was<br>impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in<br>a vigorous attack on the orator.<br><br>“But, my dear Monsieur Pierre,” said she, “how do you explain the<br>fact of a great man executing a duc—or even an ordinary man who—is<br>innocent and untried?”<br><br>“I should like,” said the vicomte, “to ask how monsieur explains<br>the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not<br>at all like the conduct of a great man!”<br><br>“And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!” said the<br>little princess, shrugging her shoulders.<br><br>“He’s a low fellow, say what you will,” remarked Prince Hippolyte.<br><br>Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His<br>smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled,<br>his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by<br>another—a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to<br>ask forgiveness.<br><br>The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that<br>this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were<br>silent.<br><br>“How do you expect him to answer you all at once?” said Prince<br>Andrew. “Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish<br>between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor.<br>So it seems to me.”<br><br>“Yes, yes, of course!” Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of<br>this reinforcement.<br><br>“One must admit,” continued Prince Andrew, “that Napoleon as a man<br>was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he<br>gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts<br>which it is difficult to justify.”<br><br>Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of<br>Pierre’s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to<br>go.<br><br>Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,<br>and asking them all to be seated began:<br><br>“I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it.<br>Excuse me, Vicomte—I must tell it in Russian or the point will be<br>lost....” And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian<br>as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.<br>Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their<br>attention to his story.<br><br>“There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must<br>have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her<br>taste. And she had a lady’s maid, also big. She said....”<br><br>Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with<br>difficulty.<br><br>“She said.... Oh yes! She said, ‘Girl,’ to the maid, ‘put on a<br>livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some<br>calls.’”<br><br>Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his<br>audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several<br>persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna Pávlovna, did however<br>smile.<br><br>“She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and<br>her long hair came down....” Here he could contain himself no<br>longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: “And the whole world<br>knew....”<br><br>And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told<br>it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pávlovna and the<br>others appreciated Prince Hippolyte’s social tact in so agreeably<br>ending Pierre’s unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote<br>the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last<br>and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and<br>where.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>Having thanked Anna Pávlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began<br>to take their leave.<br><br>Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge<br>red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing<br>room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something<br>particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was<br>absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the<br>general’s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume,<br>till the general asked him to restore it. All his absent-mindedness and<br>inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by<br>his kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna Pávlovna turned toward<br>him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his<br>indiscretion, nodded and said: “I hope to see you again, but I also<br>hope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.”<br><br>When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody<br>saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, “Opinions are<br>opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.” And<br>everyone, including Anna Pávlovna, felt this.<br><br>Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders<br>to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened<br>indifferently to his wife’s chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also<br>come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant<br>princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.<br><br>“Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold,” said the little princess,<br>taking leave of Anna Pávlovna. “It is settled,” she added in a low<br>voice.<br><br>Anna Pávlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she<br>contemplated between Anatole and the little princess’ sister-in-law.<br><br>“I rely on you, my dear,” said Anna Pávlovna, also in a low tone.<br>“Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au<br>revoir! ”—and she left the hall.<br><br>Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face<br>close to her, began to whisper something.<br><br>Two footmen, the princess’ and his own, stood holding a shawl and<br>a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to<br>the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of<br>understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as usual<br>spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.<br><br>“I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador’s,” said Prince<br>Hippolyte “—so dull—. It has been a delightful evening, has it<br>not? Delightful!”<br><br>“They say the ball will be very good,” replied the princess, drawing<br>up her downy little lip. “All the pretty women in society will be<br>there.”<br><br>“Not all, for you will not be there; not all,” said Prince Hippolyte<br>smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he<br>even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from<br>awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the<br>shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as<br>though embracing her.<br><br>Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her<br>husband. Prince Andrew’s eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he<br>seem.<br><br>“Are you ready?” he asked his wife, looking past her.<br><br>Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion<br>reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch<br>following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.<br><br>“Princesse, au revoir,” cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well<br>as with his feet.<br><br>The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark<br>carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under<br>pretense of helping, was in everyone’s way.<br><br>“Allow me, sir,” said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold,<br>disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.<br><br>“I am expecting you, Pierre,” said the same voice, but gently and<br>affectionately.<br><br>The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte<br>laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte<br>whom he had promised to take home.<br><br>“Well, mon cher,” said the vicomte, having seated himself beside<br>Hippolyte in the carriage, “your little princess is very nice, very<br>nice indeed, quite French,” and he kissed the tips of his fingers.<br>Hippolyte burst out laughing.<br><br>“Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,”<br>continued the vicomte. “I pity the poor husband, that little officer<br>who gives himself the airs of a monarch.”<br><br>Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, “And you were<br>saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to<br>know how to deal with them.”<br><br>Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew’s study like<br>one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took<br>from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesar’s<br>Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.<br><br>“What have you done to Mlle Schérer? She will be quite ill now,”<br>said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white<br>hands.<br><br>Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eager<br>face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.<br><br>“That abbé is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the<br>right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but—I do not<br>know how to express it ... not by a balance of political power....”<br><br>It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract<br>conversation.<br><br>“One can’t everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have<br>you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a<br>diplomatist?” asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.<br><br>Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.<br><br>“Really, I don’t yet know. I don’t like either the one or the<br>other.”<br><br>“But you must decide on something! Your father expects it.”<br><br>Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbé as tutor,<br>and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow<br>his father dismissed the abbé and said to the young man, “Now go<br>to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to<br>anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasíli, and here is money. Write<br>to me all about it, and I will help you in everything.” Pierre had<br>already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided<br>on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking.<br>Pierre rubbed his forehead.<br><br>“But he must be a Freemason,” said he, referring to the abbé whom<br>he had met that evening.<br><br>“That is all nonsense.” Prince Andrew again interrupted him, “let<br>us talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?”<br><br>“No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted<br>to tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for<br>freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army;<br>but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is<br>not right.”<br><br>Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre’s childish words.<br>He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such<br>nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other<br>answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naïve question.<br><br>“If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no<br>wars,” he said.<br><br>“And that would be splendid,” said Pierre.<br><br>Prince Andrew smiled ironically.<br><br>“Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....”<br><br>“Well, why are you going to the war?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“What for? I don’t know. I must. Besides that I am going....” He<br>paused. “I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit<br>me!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>The rustle of a woman’s dress was heard in the next room. Prince<br>Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it<br>had had in Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from<br>the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house<br>dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely<br>placed a chair for her.<br><br>“How is it,” she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly<br>and fussily in the easy chair, “how is it Annette never got married?<br>How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying<br>so, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you<br>are, Monsieur Pierre!”<br><br>“And I am still arguing with your husband. I can’t understand why he<br>wants to go to the war,” replied Pierre, addressing the princess<br>with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their<br>intercourse with young women.<br><br>The princess started. Evidently Pierre’s words touched her to the<br>quick.<br><br>“Ah, that is just what I tell him!” said she. “I don’t<br>understand it; I don’t in the least understand why men can’t live<br>without wars. How is it that we women don’t want anything of the kind,<br>don’t need it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here<br>he is Uncle’s aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so<br>well known, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the<br>Apráksins’ I heard a lady asking, ‘Is that the famous Prince<br>Andrew?’ I did indeed.” She laughed. “He is so well received<br>everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You know<br>the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were speaking of<br>how to arrange it. What do you think?”<br><br>Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the<br>conversation, gave no reply.<br><br>“When are you starting?” he asked.<br><br>“Oh, don’t speak of his going, don’t! I won’t hear it spoken<br>of,” said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which<br>she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly<br>ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member.<br>“Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations<br>must be broken off ... and then you know, André...” (she looked<br>significantly at her husband) “I’m afraid, I’m afraid!” she<br>whispered, and a shudder ran down her back.<br><br>Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides<br>Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of<br>frigid politeness.<br><br>“What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don’t understand,” said he.<br><br>“There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim<br>of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone<br>in the country.”<br><br>“With my father and sister, remember,” said Prince Andrew gently.<br><br>“Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to<br>be afraid.”<br><br>Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a<br>joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she<br>felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the<br>gist of the matter lay in that.<br><br>“I still can’t understand what you are afraid of,” said Prince<br>Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.<br><br>The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.<br><br>“No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....”<br><br>“Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,” said Prince Andrew.<br>“You had better go.”<br><br>The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered.<br>Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.<br><br>Pierre looked over his spectacles with naïve surprise, now at him and<br>now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.<br><br>“Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?” exclaimed the little<br>princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful<br>grimace. “I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed<br>so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no<br>pity for me. Why is it?”<br><br>“Lise!” was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed<br>an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself<br>regret her words. But she went on hurriedly:<br><br>“You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave<br>like that six months ago?”<br><br>“Lise, I beg you to desist,” said Prince Andrew still more<br>emphatically.<br><br>Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to<br>all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the<br>sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.<br><br>“Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you<br>I myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me!<br>An outsider is out of place here.... No, don’t distress yourself....<br>Good-by!”<br><br>Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.<br><br>“No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of<br>the pleasure of spending the evening with you.”<br><br>“No, he thinks only of himself,” muttered the princess without<br>restraining her angry tears.<br><br>“Lise!” said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch<br>which indicates that patience is exhausted.<br><br>Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess’ pretty<br>face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes<br>glanced askance at her husband’s face, and her own assumed the timid,<br>deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its<br>drooping tail.<br><br>“Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!” she muttered, and lifting her dress with one<br>hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.<br><br>“Good night, Lise,” said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand<br>as he would have done to a stranger.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre<br>continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead<br>with his small hand.<br><br>“Let us go and have supper,” he said with a sigh, going to the door.<br><br>They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room.<br>Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore<br>that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married.<br>Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and,<br>with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on<br>his face, began to talk—as one who has long had something on his mind<br>and suddenly determines to speak out.<br><br>“Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That’s my advice: never marry<br>till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of,<br>and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen<br>her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable<br>mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing—or all that is<br>good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles.<br>Yes! Yes! Yes! Don’t look at me with such surprise. If you marry<br>expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every<br>step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing<br>room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an<br>idiot!... But what’s the good?...” and he waved his arm.<br><br>Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and<br>the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend<br>in amazement.<br><br>“My wife,” continued Prince Andrew, “is an excellent woman, one<br>of those rare women with whom a man’s honor is safe; but, O God, what<br>would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to<br>whom I mention this, because I like you.”<br><br>As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkónski<br>who had lolled in Anna Pávlovna’s easy chairs and with half-closed<br>eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his<br>thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which<br>the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant<br>light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary<br>times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid<br>irritation.<br><br>“You don’t understand why I say this,” he continued, “but it is<br>the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,” said<br>he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), “but Bonaparte when<br>he worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing<br>but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with<br>a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you<br>have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with<br>regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality—these are<br>the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war,<br>the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for<br>nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,” continued Prince<br>Andrew, “and at Anna Pávlovna’s they listen to me. And that stupid<br>set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women.... If you only<br>knew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is<br>right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everything—that’s what<br>women are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them<br>in society it seems as if there were something in them, but there’s<br>nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don’t marry, my dear fellow; don’t<br>marry!” concluded Prince Andrew.<br><br>“It seems funny to me,” said Pierre, “that you, you should<br>consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have<br>everything before you, everything. And you....”<br><br>He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he<br>thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.<br><br>“How can he talk like that?” thought Pierre. He considered his<br>friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the<br>highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might<br>be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at<br>Prince Andrew’s calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary<br>memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything,<br>and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for<br>work and study. And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew’s lack<br>of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was<br>particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a<br>sign of strength.<br><br>Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise<br>and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels<br>that they may run smoothly.<br><br>“My part is played out,” said Prince Andrew. “What’s the use of<br>talking about me? Let us talk about you,” he added after a silence,<br>smiling at his reassuring thoughts.<br><br>That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre’s face.<br><br>“But what is there to say about me?” said Pierre, his face relaxing<br>into a careless, merry smile. “What am I? An illegitimate son!”<br>He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great<br>effort to say this. “Without a name and without means... And it<br>really...” But he did not say what “it really” was. “For the<br>present I am free and am all right. Only I haven’t the least idea what<br>I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.”<br><br>Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance—friendly and<br>affectionate as it was—expressed a sense of his own superiority.<br><br>“I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our<br>whole set. Yes, you’re all right! Choose what you will; it’s all the<br>same. You’ll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting<br>those Kurágins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so<br>badly—all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!”<br><br>“What would you have, my dear fellow?” answered Pierre, shrugging<br>his shoulders. “Women, my dear fellow; women!”<br><br>“I don’t understand it,” replied Prince Andrew. “Women who are<br>comme il faut, that’s a different matter; but the Kurágins’ set of<br>women, ‘women and wine’ I don’t understand!”<br><br>Pierre was staying at Prince Vasíli Kurágin’s and sharing the<br>dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to<br>reform by marrying him to Prince Andrew’s sister.<br><br>“Do you know?” said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy<br>thought, “seriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such<br>a life I can’t decide or think properly about anything. One’s head<br>aches, and one spends all one’s money. He asked me for tonight, but I<br>won’t go.”<br><br>“You give me your word of honor not to go?”<br><br>“On my honor!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>It was past one o’clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a<br>cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending<br>to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he<br>felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light<br>enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like<br>morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole<br>Kurágin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which<br>there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind<br>Pierre was very fond of.<br><br>“I should like to go to Kurágin’s,” thought he.<br><br>But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go<br>there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so<br>passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to<br>that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his<br>promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it<br>he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering;<br>“besides,” thought he, “all such ‘words of honor’ are<br>conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if<br>one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so<br>extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the<br>same!” Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying<br>all his decisions and intentions. He went to Kurágin’s.<br><br>Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards’ barracks, in which<br>Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs,<br>and went in at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty<br>bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of<br>alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.<br><br>Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed.<br>Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the<br>remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on<br>the sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of<br>laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and<br>general commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously<br>round an open window. Three others were romping with a young bear, one<br>pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.<br><br>“I bet a hundred on Stevens!” shouted one.<br><br>“Mind, no holding on!” cried another.<br><br>“I bet on Dólokhov!” cried a third. “Kurágin, you part our<br>hands.”<br><br>“There, leave Bruin alone; here’s a bet on.”<br><br>“At one draught, or he loses!” shouted a fourth.<br><br>“Jacob, bring a bottle!” shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow<br>who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine<br>linen shirt unfastened in front. “Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here is<br>Pétya! Good man!” cried he, addressing Pierre.<br><br>Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,<br>particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober<br>ring, cried from the window: “Come here; part the bets!” This was<br>Dólokhov, an officer of the Semënov regiment, a notorious gambler and<br>duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him<br>merrily.<br><br>“I don’t understand. What’s it all about?”<br><br>“Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,” said Anatole, and<br>taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.<br><br>“First of all you must drink!”<br><br>Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at<br>the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening<br>to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre’s glass while<br>explaining that Dólokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval<br>officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge<br>of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.<br><br>“Go on, you must drink it all,” said Anatole, giving Pierre the last<br>glass, “or I won’t let you go!”<br><br>“No, I won’t,” said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up<br>to the window.<br><br>Dólokhov was holding the Englishman’s hand and clearly and distinctly<br>repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to<br>Anatole and Pierre.<br><br>Dólokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He<br>was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache,<br>so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly<br>seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle<br>of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm<br>lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually<br>round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute,<br>insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it<br>impossible not to notice his face. Dólokhov was a man of small means<br>and no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of<br>rubles, Dólokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a<br>footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him<br>more than they did Anatole. Dólokhov could play all games and nearly<br>always won. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness.<br>Both Kurágin and Dólokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes<br>and scapegraces of Petersburg.<br><br>The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone<br>from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who<br>were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of<br>the gentlemen around.<br><br>Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to<br>smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but<br>could not move it. He smashed a pane.<br><br>“You have a try, Hercules,” said he, turning to Pierre.<br><br>Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with<br>a crash.<br><br>“Take it right out, or they’ll think I’m holding on,” said<br>Dólokhov.<br><br>“Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?” said Anatole.<br><br>“First-rate,” said Pierre, looking at Dólokhov, who with a bottle<br>of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of<br>the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.<br><br>Dólokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window<br>sill. “Listen!” cried he, standing there and addressing those in the<br>room. All were silent.<br><br>“I bet fifty imperials”—he spoke French that the Englishman might<br>understand him, but he did not speak it very well—“I bet fifty<br>imperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?” added he,<br>addressing the Englishman.<br><br>“No, fifty,” replied the latter.<br><br>“All right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of<br>rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this<br>spot” (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window)<br>“and without holding on to anything. Is that right?”<br><br>“Quite right,” said the Englishman.<br><br>Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons<br>of his coat and looking down at him—the Englishman was short—began<br>repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.<br><br>“Wait!” cried Dólokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window<br>sill to attract attention. “Wait a bit, Kurágin. Listen! If<br>anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you<br>understand?”<br><br>The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to<br>accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though<br>he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating<br>Dólokhov’s words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the<br>Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window<br>sill, leaned over, and looked down.<br><br>“Oh! Oh! Oh!” he muttered, looking down from the window at the<br>stones of the pavement.<br><br>“Shut up!” cried Dólokhov, pushing him away from the window. The<br>lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.<br><br>Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily,<br>Dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered<br>his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself<br>on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to<br>the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and<br>placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light.<br>Dólokhov’s back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit<br>up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in<br>front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older than the others<br>present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted<br>to seize hold of Dólokhov’s shirt.<br><br>“I say, this is folly! He’ll be killed,” said this more sensible<br>man.<br><br>Anatole stopped him.<br><br>“Don’t touch him! You’ll startle him and then he’ll be killed.<br>Eh?... What then?... Eh?”<br><br>Dólokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged<br>himself on his seat.<br><br>“If anyone comes meddling again,” said he, emitting the words<br>separately through his thin compressed lips, “I will throw him down<br>there. Now then!”<br><br>Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle<br>and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand<br>to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some<br>broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the<br>window and from Dólokhov’s back. Anatole stood erect with staring<br>eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man<br>who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw<br>himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from<br>which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed<br>horror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes.<br>Dólokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown<br>further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand<br>holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the<br>effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher<br>and his head tilting yet further back. “Why is it so long?” thought<br>Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed.<br>Suddenly Dólokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm<br>trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip<br>as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and<br>arm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch<br>the window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered<br>his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he was<br>aware of a stir all around. He looked up: Dólokhov was standing on the<br>window sill, with a pale but radiant face.<br><br>“It’s empty.”<br><br>He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. Dólokhov<br>jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.<br><br>“Well done!... Fine fellow!... There’s a bet for you!... Devil take<br>you!” came from different sides.<br><br>The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money.<br>Dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the<br>window sill.<br><br>“Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I’ll do the same thing!”<br>he suddenly cried. “Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a<br>bottle. I’ll do it.... Bring a bottle!”<br><br>“Let him do it, let him do it,” said Dólokhov, smiling.<br><br>“What next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go<br>giddy even on a staircase,” exclaimed several voices.<br><br>“I’ll drink it! Let’s have a bottle of rum!” shouted Pierre,<br>banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to<br>climb out of the window.<br><br>They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who<br>touched him was sent flying.<br><br>“No, you’ll never manage him that way,” said Anatole. “Wait a<br>bit and I’ll get round him.... Listen! I’ll take your bet tomorrow,<br>but now we are all going to ——’s.”<br><br>“Come on then,” cried Pierre. “Come on!... And we’ll take Bruin<br>with us.”<br><br>And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground,<br>and began dancing round the room with it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>Prince Vasíli kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetskáya<br>who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Borís on the evening of<br>Anna Pávlovna’s soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an<br>exception made, and Borís transferred into the regiment of Semënov<br>Guards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment<br>to Kutúzov’s staff despite all Anna Mikháylovna’s endeavors and<br>entreaties. Soon after Anna Pávlovna’s reception Anna Mikháylovna<br>returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the<br>Rostóvs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling<br>Bóry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being<br>at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from<br>childhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had already left<br>Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in<br>Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to Radzivílov.<br><br>It was St. Natalia’s day and the name day of two of the Rostóvs—the<br>mother and the youngest daughter—both named Nataly. Ever since<br>the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going<br>continually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rostóva’s big house on<br>the Povarskáya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself and<br>her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors<br>who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in<br>relays.<br><br>The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type<br>of face, evidently worn out with childbearing—she had had twelve.<br>A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a<br>distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna Mikháylovna<br>Drubetskáya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the<br>drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young<br>people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to<br>take part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw<br>them off, inviting them all to dinner.<br><br>“I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,” or “ma chère”—he<br>called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation<br>in his tone, “my dear,” whether they were above or below him in<br>rank—“I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name<br>day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended,<br>ma chère! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!”<br>These words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and<br>with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the<br>same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As<br>soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were<br>still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily<br>spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air<br>of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and<br>fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on<br>questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but<br>self-confident French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in<br>the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking<br>his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner.<br>Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the<br>conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables<br>were being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who<br>were bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask<br>table linen, he would call Dmítri Vasílevich, a man of good family and<br>the manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the<br>enormous table would say: “Well, Dmítri, you’ll see that things are<br>all as they should be? That’s right! The great thing is the serving,<br>that’s it.” And with a complacent sigh he would return to the<br>drawing room.<br><br>“Márya Lvóvna Karágina and her daughter!” announced the<br>countess’ gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing<br>room. The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold<br>snuffbox with her husband’s portrait on it.<br><br>“I’m quite worn out by these callers. However, I’ll see her and<br>no more. She is so affected. Ask her in,” she said to the footman in a<br>sad voice, as if saying: “Very well, finish me off.”<br><br>A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling<br>daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.<br><br>“Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ...<br>at the Razumóvski’s ball ... and Countess Apráksina ... I was<br>so delighted...” came the sounds of animated feminine voices,<br>interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and<br>the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last<br>out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses<br>and say, “I am so delighted... Mamma’s health... and Countess<br>Apráksina...” and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put<br>on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief<br>topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of<br>Catherine’s day, Count Bezúkhov, and about his illegitimate son<br>Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna Pávlovna’s<br>reception.<br><br>“I am so sorry for the poor count,” said the visitor. “He is in<br>such bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill<br>him!”<br><br>“What is that?” asked the countess as if she did not know what the<br>visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of<br>Count Bezúkhov’s distress some fifteen times.<br><br>“That’s what comes of a modern education,” exclaimed the visitor.<br>“It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do<br>as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible<br>things that he has been expelled by the police.”<br><br>“You don’t say so!” replied the countess.<br><br>“He chose his friends badly,” interposed Anna Mikháylovna.<br>“Prince Vasíli’s son, he, and a certain Dólokhov have, it is said,<br>been up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it.<br>Dólokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezúkhov’s son sent<br>back to Moscow. Anatole Kurágin’s father managed somehow to get his<br>son’s affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.”<br><br>“But what have they been up to?” asked the countess.<br><br>“They are regular brigands, especially Dólokhov,” replied the<br>visitor. “He is a son of Márya Ivánovna Dólokhova, such a worthy<br>woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere,<br>put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The<br>police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied<br>a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka<br>Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his<br>back!”<br><br>“What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!” shouted<br>the count, dying with laughter.<br><br>“Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?”<br><br>Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.<br><br>“It was all they could do to rescue the poor man,” continued the<br>visitor. “And to think it is Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov’s son<br>who amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so<br>well educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has<br>done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in<br>spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite<br>declined: I have my daughters to consider.”<br><br>“Why do you say this young man is so rich?” asked the countess,<br>turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention.<br>“His children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is<br>illegitimate.”<br><br>The visitor made a gesture with her hand.<br><br>“I should think he has a score of them.”<br><br>Princess Anna Mikháylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently<br>wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in<br>society.<br><br>“The fact of the matter is,” said she significantly, and also in a<br>half whisper, “everyone knows Count Cyril’s reputation.... He has<br>lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.”<br><br>“How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!” remarked the<br>countess. “I have never seen a handsomer man.”<br><br>“He is very much altered now,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “Well, as<br>I was saying, Prince Vasíli is the next heir through his wife, but the<br>count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to<br>the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death—and he is<br>so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from<br>Petersburg—no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre<br>or Prince Vasíli. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know<br>it all very well for Prince Vasíli told me himself. Besides, Cyril<br>Vladímirovich is my mother’s second cousin. He’s also my Bóry’s<br>godfather,” she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the<br>fact.<br><br>“Prince Vasíli arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on<br>some inspection business,” remarked the visitor.<br><br>“Yes, but between ourselves,” said the princess, “that is a<br>pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladímirovich,<br>hearing how ill he is.”<br><br>“But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,” said the count;<br>and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the<br>young ladies. “I can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman<br>cut!”<br><br>And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form<br>again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats<br>well and, in particular, drinks well. “So do come and dine with us!”<br>he said.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably,<br>but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they<br>now rose and took their leave. The visitor’s daughter was already<br>smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when<br>suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls<br>running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl<br>of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock,<br>darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was evident<br>that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in<br>the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer<br>of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short<br>jacket.<br><br>The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide<br>and threw them round the little girl who had run in.<br><br>“Ah, here she is!” he exclaimed laughing. “My pet, whose name day<br>it is. My dear pet!”<br><br>“Ma chère, there is a time for everything,” said the countess with<br>feigned severity. “You spoil her, Ilyá,” she added, turning to her<br>husband.<br><br>“How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name<br>day,” said the visitor. “What a charming child,” she added,<br>addressing the mother.<br><br>This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life—with<br>childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her<br>bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs<br>in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers—was just at that<br>charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not<br>yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed<br>face in the lace of her mother’s mantilla—not paying the least<br>attention to her severe remark—and began to laugh. She laughed, and in<br>fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced<br>from the folds of her frock.<br><br>“Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...” was all Natásha<br>managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against<br>her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even<br>the prim visitor could not help joining in.<br><br>“Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,” said the<br>mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning<br>to the visitor she added: “She is my youngest girl.”<br><br>Natásha, raising her face for a moment from her mother’s mantilla,<br>glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.<br><br>The visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it<br>necessary to take some part in it.<br><br>“Tell me, my dear,” said she to Natásha, “is Mimi a relation of<br>yours? A daughter, I suppose?”<br><br>Natásha did not like the visitor’s tone of condescension to childish<br>things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.<br><br>Meanwhile the younger generation: Borís, the officer, Anna<br>Mikháylovna’s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count’s eldest<br>son; Sónya, the count’s fifteen-year-old niece, and little Pétya,<br>his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were<br>obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement<br>and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the back rooms,<br>from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had<br>been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the<br>weather, and Countess Apráksina. Now and then they glanced at one<br>another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.<br><br>The two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood,<br>were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. Borís<br>was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate<br>features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression.<br>Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face<br>expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered<br>the drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but<br>failed. Borís on the contrary at once found his footing, and related<br>quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was<br>still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged<br>during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked<br>right across the skull. Having said this he glanced at Natásha.<br>She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was<br>screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable<br>to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as<br>fast as her nimble little feet would carry her. Borís did not laugh.<br><br>“You were meaning to go out, weren’t you, Mamma? Do you want the<br>carriage?” he asked his mother with a smile.<br><br>“Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,” she answered,<br>returning his smile.<br><br>Borís quietly left the room and went in search of Natásha. The plump<br>boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been<br>disturbed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the<br>young lady visitor and the countess’ eldest daughter (who was four<br>years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person),<br>were Nicholas and Sónya, the niece. Sónya was a slender little<br>brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long<br>lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny<br>tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but<br>graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her movements,<br>by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain<br>coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown<br>kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently<br>considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by<br>smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes<br>watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate<br>girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose<br>upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to<br>spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as<br>they too could, like Natásha and Borís, escape from the drawing room.<br><br>“Ah yes, my dear,” said the count, addressing the visitor and<br>pointing to Nicholas, “his friend Borís has become an officer, and<br>so for friendship’s sake he is leaving the university and me, his<br>old father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a<br>place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isn’t<br>that friendship?” remarked the count in an inquiring tone.<br><br>“But they say that war has been declared,” replied the visitor.<br><br>“They’ve been saying so a long while,” said the count, “and<br>they’ll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My<br>dear, there’s friendship for you,” he repeated. “He’s joining<br>the hussars.”<br><br>The visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.<br><br>“It’s not at all from friendship,” declared Nicholas, flaring<br>up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. “It is not from<br>friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.”<br><br>He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both<br>regarding him with a smile of approbation.<br><br>“Schubert, the colonel of the Pávlograd Hussars, is dining with us<br>today. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him.<br>It can’t be helped!” said the count, shrugging his shoulders and<br>speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.<br><br>“I have already told you, Papa,” said his son, “that if you<br>don’t wish to let me go, I’ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere<br>except in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.—I<br>don’t know how to hide what I feel.” As he spoke he kept glancing<br>with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at Sónya and the young<br>lady visitor.<br><br>The little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment<br>to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.<br><br>“All right, all right!” said the old count. “He always flares up!<br>This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he<br>rose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,” he<br>added, not noticing his visitor’s sarcastic smile.<br><br>The elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karágina turned to<br>young Rostóv.<br><br>“What a pity you weren’t at the Arkhárovs’ on Thursday. It was so<br>dull without you,” said she, giving him a tender smile.<br><br>The young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish<br>smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation<br>without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart<br>of Sónya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk<br>he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and<br>hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile<br>on her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholas’ animation<br>vanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then<br>with a distressed face left the room to find Sónya.<br><br>“How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their<br>sleeves!” said Anna Mikháylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out.<br>“Cousinage—dangereux voisinage,” * she added.<br><br>     * Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.<br><br>“Yes,” said the countess when the brightness these young people had<br>brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no<br>one had put but which was always in her mind, “and how much suffering,<br>how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in<br>them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is<br>always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both<br>for girls and boys.”<br><br>“It all depends on the bringing up,” remarked the visitor.<br><br>“Yes, you’re quite right,” continued the countess. “Till now I<br>have always, thank God, been my children’s friend and had their full<br>confidence,” said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who<br>imagine that their children have no secrets from them. “I know I shall<br>always be my daughters’ first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with<br>his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can’t help it), he<br>will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.”<br><br>“Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,” chimed in the count,<br>who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding<br>that everything was splendid. “Just fancy: wants to be an hussar.<br>What’s one to do, my dear?”<br><br>“What a charming creature your younger girl is,” said the visitor;<br>“a little volcano!”<br><br>“Yes, a regular volcano,” said the count. “Takes after me! And<br>what a voice she has; though she’s my daughter, I tell the truth<br>when I say she’ll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an<br>Italian to give her lessons.”<br><br>“Isn’t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train<br>it at that age.”<br><br>“Oh no, not at all too young!” replied the count. “Why, our<br>mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.”<br><br>“And she’s in love with Borís already. Just fancy!” said the<br>countess with a gentle smile, looking at Borís and went on, evidently<br>concerned with a thought that always occupied her: “Now you see if I<br>were to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they<br>might be up to on the sly” (she meant that they would be kissing),<br>“but as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to<br>me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I<br>spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I<br>was stricter.”<br><br>“Yes, I was brought up quite differently,” remarked the handsome<br>elder daughter, Countess Véra, with a smile.<br><br>But the smile did not enhance Véra’s beauty as smiles generally do;<br>on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant,<br>expression. Véra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at<br>learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said<br>was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone—the visitors<br>and countess alike—turned to look at her as if wondering why she had<br>said it, and they all felt awkward.<br><br>“People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to<br>make something exceptional of them,” said the visitor.<br><br>“What’s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too<br>clever with Véra,” said the count. “Well, what of that? She’s<br>turned out splendidly all the same,” he added, winking at Véra.<br><br>The guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.<br><br>“What manners! I thought they would never go,” said the countess,<br>when she had seen her guests out.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>When Natásha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the<br>conservatory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation<br>in the drawing room, waiting for Borís to come out. She was already<br>growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming<br>at once, when she heard the young man’s discreet steps approaching<br>neither quickly nor slowly. At this Natásha dashed swiftly among the<br>flower tubs and hid there.<br><br>Borís paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little<br>dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined<br>his handsome face. Natásha, very still, peered out from her ambush,<br>waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while before the<br>glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. Natásha was about to<br>call him but changed her mind. “Let him look for me,” thought she.<br>Hardly had Borís gone than Sónya, flushed, in tears, and muttering<br>angrily, came in at the other door. Natásha checked her first impulse<br>to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watching—as<br>under an invisible cap—to see what went on in the world. She was<br>experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure. Sónya, muttering to herself,<br>kept looking round toward the drawing room door. It opened and Nicholas<br>came in.<br><br>“Sónya, what is the matter with you? How can you?” said he, running<br>up to her.<br><br>“It’s nothing, nothing; leave me alone!” sobbed Sónya.<br><br>“Ah, I know what it is.”<br><br>“Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!”<br><br>“Só-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that,<br>for a mere fancy?” said Nicholas taking her hand.<br><br>Sónya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Natásha, not stirring<br>and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes.<br>“What will happen now?” thought she.<br><br>“Sónya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are<br>everything!” said Nicholas. “And I will prove it to you.”<br><br>“I don’t like you to talk like that.”<br><br>“Well, then, I won’t; only forgive me, Sónya!” He drew her to him<br>and kissed her.<br><br>“Oh, how nice,” thought Natásha; and when Sónya and Nicholas had<br>gone out of the conservatory she followed and called Borís to her.<br><br>“Borís, come here,” said she with a sly and significant look. “I<br>have something to tell you. Here, here!” and she led him into the<br>conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.<br><br>Borís followed her, smiling.<br><br>“What is the something?” asked he.<br><br>She grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown<br>down on one of the tubs, picked it up.<br><br>“Kiss the doll,” said she.<br><br>Borís looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not<br>reply.<br><br>“Don’t you want to? Well, then, come here,” said she, and<br>went further in among the plants and threw down the doll. “Closer,<br>closer!” she whispered.<br><br>She caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and<br>fear appeared on her flushed face.<br><br>“And me? Would you like to kiss me?” she whispered almost inaudibly,<br>glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from<br>excitement.<br><br>Borís blushed.<br><br>“How funny you are!” he said, bending down to her and blushing still<br>more, but he waited and did nothing.<br><br>Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so<br>that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing<br>back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.<br><br>Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs<br>and stood, hanging her head.<br><br>“Natásha,” he said, “you know that I love you, but....”<br><br>“You are in love with me?” Natásha broke in.<br><br>“Yes, I am, but please don’t let us do like that.... In another four<br>years ... then I will ask for your hand.”<br><br>Natásha considered.<br><br>“Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,” she counted on her slender<br>little fingers. “All right! Then it’s settled?”<br><br>A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.<br><br>“Settled!” replied Borís.<br><br>“Forever?” said the little girl. “Till death itself?”<br><br>She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining<br>sitting room.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>After receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave<br>orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite to<br>dinner all who came “to congratulate.” The countess wished to have<br>a tête-à-tête talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna<br>Mikháylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from<br>Petersburg. Anna Mikháylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face,<br>drew her chair nearer to that of the countess.<br><br>“With you I will be quite frank,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “There<br>are not many left of us old friends! That’s why I so value your<br>friendship.”<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna looked at Véra and paused. The countess pressed her<br>friend’s hand.<br><br>“Véra,” she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a<br>favorite, “how is it you have so little tact? Don’t you see you are<br>not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or...”<br><br>The handsome Véra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.<br><br>“If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone,” she replied<br>as she rose to go to her own room.<br><br>But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting,<br>one pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. Sónya was<br>sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the<br>first he had ever written. Borís and Natásha were at the other window<br>and ceased talking when Véra entered. Sónya and Natásha looked at<br>Véra with guilty, happy faces.<br><br>It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but<br>apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Véra.<br><br>“How often have I asked you not to take my things?” she said. “You<br>have a room of your own,” and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.<br><br>“In a minute, in a minute,” he said, dipping his pen.<br><br>“You always manage to do things at the wrong time,” continued Véra.<br>“You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed<br>of you.”<br><br>Though what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one<br>replied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the<br>room with the inkstand in her hand.<br><br>“And at your age what secrets can there be between Natásha and<br>Borís, or between you two? It’s all nonsense!”<br><br>“Now, Véra, what does it matter to you?” said Natásha in defense,<br>speaking very gently.<br><br>She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to<br>everyone.<br><br>“Very silly,” said Véra. “I am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!”<br><br>“All have secrets of their own,” answered Natásha, getting warmer.<br>“We don’t interfere with you and Berg.”<br><br>“I should think not,” said Véra, “because there can never be<br>anything wrong in my behavior. But I’ll just tell Mamma how you are<br>behaving with Borís.”<br><br>“Natálya Ilyníchna behaves very well to me,” remarked Borís. “I<br>have nothing to complain of.”<br><br>“Don’t, Borís! You are such a diplomat that it is really<br>tiresome,” said Natásha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly.<br>(She used the word “diplomat,” which was just then much in vogue<br>among the children, in the special sense they attached to it.) “Why<br>does she bother me?” And she added, turning to Véra, “You’ll<br>never understand it, because you’ve never loved anyone. You have no<br>heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more” (this nickname,<br>bestowed on Véra by Nicholas, was considered very stinging), “and<br>your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with<br>Berg as much as you please,” she finished quickly.<br><br>“I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors...”<br><br>“Well, now you’ve done what you wanted,” put in Nicholas—“said<br>unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let’s go to the<br>nursery.”<br><br>All four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.<br><br>“The unpleasant things were said to me,” remarked Véra, “I said<br>none to anyone.”<br><br>“Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!” shouted laughing voices<br>through the door.<br><br>The handsome Véra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant<br>effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been<br>said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf.<br>Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and<br>calmer.<br><br><br>In the drawing room the conversation was still going on.<br><br>“Ah, my dear,” said the countess, “my life is not all roses<br>either. Don’t I know that at the rate we are living our means won’t<br>last long? It’s all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the<br>country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what<br>besides! But don’t let’s talk about me; tell me how you managed<br>everything. I often wonder at you, Annette—how at your age you<br>can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those<br>ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! It’s<br>quite astonishing. How did you get things settled? I couldn’t possibly<br>do it.”<br><br>“Ah, my love,” answered Anna Mikháylovna, “God grant you never<br>know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love<br>to distraction! One learns many things then,” she added with a certain<br>pride. “That lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of those<br>big people I write a note: ‘Princess So-and-So desires an interview<br>with So and-So,’ and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or<br>four times—till I get what I want. I don’t mind what they think of<br>me.”<br><br>“Well, and to whom did you apply about Bóry?” asked the countess.<br>“You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas<br>is going as a cadet. There’s no one to interest himself for him. To<br>whom did you apply?”<br><br>“To Prince Vasíli. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything,<br>and put the matter before the Emperor,” said Princess Anna<br>Mikháylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she<br>had endured to gain her end.<br><br>“Has Prince Vasíli aged much?” asked the countess. “I have not<br>seen him since we acted together at the Rumyántsovs’ theatricals. I<br>expect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days,” said<br>the countess, with a smile.<br><br>“He is just the same as ever,” replied Anna Mikháylovna,<br>“overflowing with amiability. His position has not turned his head<br>at all. He said to me, ‘I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear<br>Princess. I am at your command.’ Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very<br>kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do<br>anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my<br>position is now a terrible one,” continued Anna Mikháylovna, sadly,<br>dropping her voice. “My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no<br>progress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a penny and don’t<br>know how to equip Borís.” She took out her handkerchief and began to<br>cry. “I need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble<br>note. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril<br>Vladímirovich Bezúkhov. If he will not assist his godson—you know<br>he is Bóry’s godfather—and allow him something for his maintenance,<br>all my trouble will have been thrown away.... I shall not be able to<br>equip him.”<br><br>The countess’ eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.<br><br>“I often think, though, perhaps it’s a sin,” said the princess,<br>“that here lives Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov so rich, all<br>alone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It’s a<br>burden to him, and Bóry’s life is only just beginning....”<br><br>“Surely he will leave something to Borís,” said the countess.<br><br>“Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish.<br>Still, I will take Borís and go to see him at once, and I shall speak<br>to him straight out. Let people think what they will of me, it’s<br>really all the same to me when my son’s fate is at stake.” The<br>princess rose. “It’s now two o’clock and you dine at four. There<br>will just be time.”<br><br>And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of<br>time, Anna Mikháylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the<br>anteroom with him.<br><br>“Good-by, my dear,” said she to the countess who saw her to the<br>door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, “Wish me<br>good luck.”<br><br>“Are you going to Count Cyril Vladímirovich, my dear?” said the<br>count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added:<br>“If he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the<br>house, you know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite him, my<br>dear. We will see how Tarás distinguishes himself today. He says Count<br>Orlóv never gave such a dinner as ours will be!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>“My dear Borís,” said Princess Anna Mikháylovna to her son as<br>Countess Rostóva’s carriage in which they were seated drove over the<br>straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril<br>Vladímirovich Bezúkhov’s house. “My dear Borís,” said the<br>mother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying<br>it timidly and tenderly on her son’s arm, “be affectionate and<br>attentive to him. Count Cyril Vladímirovich is your godfather after<br>all, and your future depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice<br>to him, as you so well know how to be.”<br><br>“If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of<br>it...” answered her son coldly. “But I have promised and will do it<br>for your sake.”<br><br>Although the hall porter saw someone’s carriage standing at the<br>entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to<br>be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the<br>rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady’s old<br>cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and,<br>hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse<br>today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.<br><br>“We may as well go back,” said the son in French.<br><br>“My dear!” exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand<br>on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.<br><br>Borís said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking<br>off his cloak.<br><br>“My friend,” said Anna Mikháylovna in gentle tones, addressing<br>the hall porter, “I know Count Cyril Vladímirovich is very ill...<br>that’s why I have come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him,<br>my friend... I only need see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich: he is staying<br>here, is he not? Please announce me.”<br><br>The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned<br>away.<br><br>“Princess Drubetskáya to see Prince Vasíli Sergéevich,” he called<br>to a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat,<br>who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.<br><br>The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large<br>Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes briskly<br>ascended the carpeted stairs.<br><br>“My dear,” she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a<br>touch, “you promised me!”<br><br>The son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.<br><br>They entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the<br>apartments assigned to Prince Vasíli.<br><br>Just as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were<br>about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they<br>entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vasíli<br>came out—wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast,<br>as was his custom when at home—taking leave of a good-looking,<br>dark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.<br><br>“Then it is certain?” said the prince.<br><br>“Prince, humanum est errare, * but...” replied the doctor,<br>swallowing his r’s, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French<br>accent.<br><br>     * To err is human.<br><br>“Very well, very well...”<br><br>Seeing Anna Mikháylovna and her son, Prince Vasíli dismissed the<br>doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of<br>inquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly<br>clouded his mother’s face, and he smiled slightly.<br><br>“Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our<br>dear invalid?” said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look<br>fixed on her.<br><br>Prince Vasíli stared at her and at Borís questioningly and perplexed.<br>Borís bowed politely. Prince Vasíli without acknowledging the bow<br>turned to Anna Mikháylovna, answering her query by a movement of the<br>head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient.<br><br>“Is it possible?” exclaimed Anna Mikháylovna. “Oh, how awful!<br>It is terrible to think.... This is my son,” she added, indicating<br>Borís. “He wanted to thank you himself.”<br><br>Borís bowed again politely.<br><br>“Believe me, Prince, a mother’s heart will never forget what you<br>have done for us.”<br><br>“I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna<br>Mikháylovna,” said Prince Vasíli, arranging his lace frill, and in<br>tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikháylovna whom he had placed<br>under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he<br>had done in Petersburg at Anna Schérer’s reception.<br><br>“Try to serve well and show yourself worthy,” added he, addressing<br>Borís with severity. “I am glad.... Are you here on leave?” he went<br>on in his usual tone of indifference.<br><br>“I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,”<br>replied Borís, betraying neither annoyance at the prince’s brusque<br>manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly<br>and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.<br><br>“Are you living with your mother?”<br><br>“I am living at Countess Rostóva’s,” replied Borís, again<br>adding, “your excellency.”<br><br>“That is, with Ilyá Rostóv who married Nataly Shinshiná,” said<br>Anna Mikháylovna.<br><br>“I know, I know,” answered Prince Vasíli in his monotonous voice.<br>“I never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that<br>unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too,<br>I am told.”<br><br>“But a very kind man, Prince,” said Anna Mikháylovna with a<br>pathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count Rostóv deserved this<br>censure, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. “What<br>do the doctors say?” asked the princess after a pause, her worn face<br>again expressing deep sorrow.<br><br>“They give little hope,” replied the prince.<br><br>“And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me<br>and Borís. He is his godson,” she added, her tone suggesting that<br>this fact ought to give Prince Vasíli much satisfaction.<br><br>Prince Vasíli became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikháylovna saw that<br>he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezúkhov’s fortune,<br>and hastened to reassure him.<br><br>“If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,”<br>said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, “I<br>know his character: noble, upright ... but you see he has no one with<br>him except the young princesses.... They are still young....” She bent<br>her head and continued in a whisper: “Has he performed his final duty,<br>Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no<br>worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill.<br>We women, Prince,” and she smiled tenderly, “always know how to say<br>these things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for<br>me. I am used to suffering.”<br><br>Evidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done<br>at Anna Pávlovna’s, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna<br>Mikháylovna.<br><br>“Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna<br>Mikháylovna?” said he. “Let us wait until evening. The doctors are<br>expecting a crisis.”<br><br>“But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the<br>welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a<br>Christian...”<br><br>A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the<br>count’s niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her<br>body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vasíli<br>turned to her.<br><br>“Well, how is he?”<br><br>“Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise...” said the<br>princess, looking at Anna Mikháylovna as at a stranger.<br><br>“Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you,” said Anna Mikháylovna with a<br>happy smile, ambling lightly up to the count’s niece. “I have come,<br>and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you<br>have gone through,” and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.<br><br>The princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as<br>Anna Mikháylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she<br>had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vasíli to<br>take a seat beside her.<br><br>“Borís,” she said to her son with a smile, “I shall go in to see<br>the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile<br>and don’t forget to give him the Rostóvs’ invitation. They ask him<br>to dinner. I suppose he won’t go?” she continued, turning to the<br>prince.<br><br>“On the contrary,” replied the prince, who had plainly become<br>depressed, “I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young<br>man.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him.”<br><br>He shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Borís down one flight of<br>stairs and up another, to Pierre’s rooms.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>Pierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in<br>Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and<br>sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rostóv’s was true.<br>Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been<br>for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father’s<br>house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be<br>already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father—who were<br>never favorably disposed toward him—would have used it to turn the<br>count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to<br>his father’s part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the<br>princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom<br>were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the<br>eldest who was reading—the one who had met Anna Mikháylovna. The<br>two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they<br>differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her<br>much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper.<br>The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him<br>with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression;<br>while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and<br>lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked<br>by the amusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool down through the<br>canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying<br>to make out the pattern.<br><br>“How do you do, cousin?” said Pierre. “You don’t recognize<br>me?”<br><br>“I recognize you only too well, too well.”<br><br>“How is the count? Can I see him?” asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual,<br>but unabashed.<br><br>“The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you<br>have done your best to increase his mental sufferings.”<br><br>“Can I see the count?” Pierre again asked.<br><br>“Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see<br>him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle’s beef tea is ready—it is<br>almost time,” she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were<br>busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he,<br>Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.<br><br>Olga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and<br>said: “Then I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see<br>him.”<br><br>And he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the<br>sister with the mole.<br><br>Next day Prince Vasíli had arrived and settled in the count’s house.<br>He sent for Pierre and said to him: “My dear fellow, if you are going<br>to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that<br>is all I have to say to you. The count is very, very ill, and you must<br>not see him at all.”<br><br>Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in<br>his rooms upstairs.<br><br>When Borís appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room,<br>stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall,<br>as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely<br>over his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering<br>indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.<br><br>“England is done for,” said he, scowling and pointing his finger<br>at someone unseen. “Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the<br>rights of man, is sentenced to...” But before Pierre—who at that<br>moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just<br>effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured<br>London—could pronounce Pitt’s sentence, he saw a well-built and<br>handsome young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left<br>Moscow when Borís was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him,<br>but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Borís by the hand<br>with a friendly smile.<br><br>“Do you remember me?” asked Borís quietly with a pleasant smile.<br>“I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not<br>well.”<br><br>“Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,”<br>answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.<br><br>Borís felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider<br>it necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least<br>embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.<br><br>“Count Rostóv asks you to come to dinner today,” said he, after a<br>considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.<br><br>“Ah, Count Rostóv!” exclaimed Pierre joyfully. “Then you are his<br>son, Ilyá? Only fancy, I didn’t know you at first. Do you remember<br>how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It’s such an<br>age...”<br><br>“You are mistaken,” said Borís deliberately, with a bold and<br>slightly sarcastic smile. “I am Borís, son of Princess Anna<br>Mikháylovna Drubetskáya. Rostóv, the father, is Ilyá, and his son is<br>Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.”<br><br>Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.<br><br>“Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I’ve mixed everything up. One<br>has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Borís? Of course. Well, now<br>we know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition?<br>The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the<br>Channel. I think the expedition is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve<br>doesn’t make a mess of things!”<br><br>Borís knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the<br>papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve’s name.<br><br>“We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal<br>than with politics,” said he in his quiet ironical tone. “I know<br>nothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy<br>with gossip,” he continued. “Just now they are talking about you and<br>your father.”<br><br>Pierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion’s<br>sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret.<br>But Borís spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into<br>Pierre’s eyes.<br><br>“Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip,” Borís went on.<br>“Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune,<br>though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...”<br><br>“Yes, it is all very horrid,” interrupted Pierre, “very horrid.”<br><br>Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say<br>something disconcerting to himself.<br><br>“And it must seem to you,” said Borís flushing slightly, but not<br>changing his tone or attitude, “it must seem to you that everyone is<br>trying to get something out of the rich man?”<br><br>“So it does,” thought Pierre.<br><br>“But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are<br>quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are<br>very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that<br>your father is rich, I don’t regard myself as a relation of his, and<br>neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.”<br><br>For a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped<br>up from the sofa, seized Borís under the elbow in his quick, clumsy<br>way, and, blushing far more than Borís, began to speak with a feeling<br>of mingled shame and vexation.<br><br>“Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know<br>very well...”<br><br>But Borís again interrupted him.<br><br>“I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You<br>must excuse me,” said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put<br>at ease by him, “but I hope I have not offended you. I always make it<br>a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to<br>dinner at the Rostóvs’?”<br><br>And Borís, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and<br>extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it,<br>became quite pleasant again.<br><br>“No, but I say,” said Pierre, calming down, “you are a wonderful<br>fellow! What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you<br>don’t know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we<br>were children. You might think that I... I understand, quite understand.<br>I could not have done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but<br>it’s splendid. I am very glad to have made your acquaintance. It’s<br>queer,” he added after a pause, “that you should have suspected<br>me!” He began to laugh. “Well, what of it! I hope we’ll get better<br>acquainted,” and he pressed Borís’ hand. “Do you know, I have not<br>once been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I am sorry for<br>him as a man, but what can one do?”<br><br>“And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?” asked<br>Borís with a smile.<br><br>Pierre saw that Borís wished to change the subject, and being of the<br>same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the<br>Boulogne expedition.<br><br>A footman came in to summon Borís—the princess was going. Pierre, in<br>order to make Borís’ better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner,<br>and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles<br>into Borís’ eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and<br>down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with<br>his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant,<br>intelligent, and resolute young man.<br><br>As often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely<br>life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up<br>his mind that they would be friends.<br><br>Prince Vasíli saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her eyes<br>and her face was tearful.<br><br>“It is dreadful, dreadful!” she was saying, “but cost me what it<br>may I shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be<br>left like this. Every moment is precious. I can’t think why his nieces<br>put it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!...<br>Adieu, Prince! May God support you...”<br><br>“Adieu, ma bonne,” answered Prince Vasíli turning away from her.<br><br>“Oh, he is in a dreadful state,” said the mother to her son when<br>they were in the carriage. “He hardly recognizes anybody.”<br><br>“I don’t understand, Mamma—what is his attitude to Pierre?”<br>asked the son.<br><br>“The will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it.”<br><br>“But why do you expect that he will leave us anything?”<br><br>“Ah, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!”<br><br>“Well, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma...”<br><br>“Oh, Heaven! How ill he is!” exclaimed the mother.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVII<br><br>After Anna Mikháylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril<br>Vladímirovich Bezúkhov, Countess Rostóva sat for a long time all<br>alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang.<br><br>“What is the matter with you, my dear?” she said crossly to the maid<br>who kept her waiting some minutes. “Don’t you wish to serve me? Then<br>I’ll find you another place.”<br><br>The countess was upset by her friend’s sorrow and humiliating poverty,<br>and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always<br>found expression in calling her maid “my dear” and speaking to her<br>with exaggerated politeness.<br><br>“I am very sorry, ma’am,” answered the maid.<br><br>“Ask the count to come to me.”<br><br>The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as<br>usual.<br><br>“Well, little countess? What a sauté of game au madère we are to<br>have, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Tarás were<br>not ill-spent. He is worth it!”<br><br>He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling<br>his gray hair.<br><br>“What are your commands, little countess?”<br><br>“You see, my dear... What’s that mess?” she said, pointing to his<br>waistcoat. “It’s the sauté, most likely,” she added with a smile.<br>“Well, you see, Count, I want some money.”<br><br>Her face became sad.<br><br>“Oh, little countess!” ... and the count began bustling to get out<br>his pocketbook.<br><br>“I want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles,” and taking<br>out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband’s waistcoat.<br><br>“Yes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who’s there?” he called out<br>in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will<br>rush to obey the summons. “Send Dmítri to me!”<br><br>Dmítri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the count’s<br>house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.<br><br>“This is what I want, my dear fellow,” said the count to the<br>deferential young man who had entered. “Bring me...” he reflected<br>a moment, “yes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, don’t<br>bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones<br>for the countess.”<br><br>“Yes, Dmítri, clean ones, please,” said the countess, sighing<br>deeply.<br><br>“When would you like them, your excellency?” asked Dmítri. “Allow<br>me to inform you... But, don’t be uneasy,” he added, noticing that<br>the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always<br>a sign of approaching anger. “I was forgetting... Do you wish it<br>brought at once?”<br><br>“Yes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess.”<br><br>“What a treasure that Dmítri is,” added the count with a smile when<br>the young man had departed. “There is never any ‘impossible’ with<br>him. That’s a thing I hate! Everything is possible.”<br><br>“Ah, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world,”<br>said the countess. “But I am in great need of this sum.”<br><br>“You, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift,” said the<br>count, and having kissed his wife’s hand he went back to his study.<br><br>When Anna Mikháylovna returned from Count Bezúkhov’s the money, all<br>in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess’<br>little table, and Anna Mikháylovna noticed that something was agitating<br>her.<br><br>“Well, my dear?” asked the countess.<br><br>“Oh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so<br>ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word...”<br><br>“Annette, for heaven’s sake don’t refuse me,” the countess<br>began, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified,<br>elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be<br>ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.<br><br>“This is for Borís from me, for his outfit.”<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess<br>wept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were<br>kindhearted, and because they—friends from childhood—had to think<br>about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over....<br>But those tears were pleasant to them both.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>Countess Rostóva, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was<br>already seated in the drawing room. The count took the gentlemen into<br>his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes. From<br>time to time he went out to ask: “Hasn’t she come yet?” They<br>were expecting Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova, known in society as le<br>terrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for<br>common sense and frank plainness of speech. Márya Dmítrievna was known<br>to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both<br>cities wondered at her, laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told<br>good stories about her, while none the less all without exception<br>respected and feared her.<br><br>In the count’s room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked<br>of the war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the<br>recruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew<br>it had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were<br>smoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head<br>first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident<br>pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he<br>egged on against each other.<br><br>One of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled<br>face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable<br>young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and,<br>having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the<br>smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor,<br>Shinshín, a cousin of the countess’, a man with “a sharp tongue”<br>as they said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to<br>his companion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards,<br>irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the<br>middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting<br>it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an<br>officer in the Semënov regiment with whom Borís was to travel to join<br>the army, and about whom Natásha had teased her elder sister Véra,<br>speaking of Berg as her “intended.” The count sat between them and<br>listened attentively. His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a<br>card game he was very fond of, was that of listener, especially when he<br>succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another.<br><br>“Well, then, old chap, mon très honorable Alphonse Kárlovich,”<br>said Shinshín, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian<br>expressions with the choicest French phrases—which was a peculiarity<br>of his speech. “Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l’état; *<br>you want to make something out of your company?”<br><br>     * You expect to make an income out of the government.<br><br>“No, Peter Nikoláevich; I only want to show that in the cavalry<br>the advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own<br>position now, Peter Nikoláevich...”<br><br>Berg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His<br>conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm<br>and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing<br>on himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put<br>out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as<br>soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk<br>circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.<br><br>“Consider my position, Peter Nikoláevich. Were I in the cavalry I<br>should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even<br>with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and<br>thirty,” said he, looking at Shinshín and the count with a joyful,<br>pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must<br>always be the chief desire of everyone else.<br><br>“Besides that, Peter Nikoláevich, by exchanging into the Guards<br>I shall be in a more prominent position,” continued Berg, “and<br>vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think<br>what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to<br>put a little aside and to send something to my father,” he went on,<br>emitting a smoke ring.<br><br>“La balance y est... * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the<br>proverb says,” remarked Shinshín, moving his pipe to the other side<br>of his mouth and winking at the count.<br><br>      * So that squares matters.<br><br>The count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that Shinshín<br>was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference,<br>continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already<br>gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime<br>the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company,<br>might easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in<br>the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently<br>enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others,<br>too, might have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily<br>sedate, and the naïveté of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that<br>he disarmed his hearers.<br><br>“Well, my boy, you’ll get along wherever you go—foot or<br>horse—that I’ll warrant,” said Shinshín, patting him on the<br>shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.<br><br>Berg smiled joyously. The count, followed by his guests, went into the<br>drawing room.<br><br>It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests,<br>expecting the summons to zakúska, * avoid engaging in any long<br>conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order<br>to show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The host and<br>hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another,<br>and the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are<br>waiting for—some important relation who has not yet arrived, or a dish<br>that is not yet ready.<br><br>     * Hors d’oeuvres.<br><br>Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the<br>middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across,<br>blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make him talk,<br>but he went on naïvely looking around through his spectacles as if in<br>search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables. He<br>was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact. Most of<br>the guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity<br>at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest<br>fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman.<br><br>“You have only lately arrived?” the countess asked him.<br><br>“Oui, madame,” replied he, looking around him.<br><br>“You have not yet seen my husband?”<br><br>“Non, madame.” He smiled quite inappropriately.<br><br>“You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it’s very<br>interesting.”<br><br>“Very interesting.”<br><br>The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikháylovna. The latter<br>understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and<br>sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he<br>answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other<br>guests were all conversing with one another. “The Razumóvskis... It<br>was charming... You are very kind... Countess Apráksina...” was heard<br>on all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.<br><br>“Márya Dmítrievna?” came her voice from there.<br><br>“Herself,” came the answer in a rough voice, and Márya Dmítrievna<br>entered the room.<br><br>All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very<br>oldest rose. Márya Dmítrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout,<br>holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood<br>surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if<br>rolling them up. Márya Dmítrievna always spoke in Russian.<br><br>“Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her<br>children,” she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all<br>others. “Well, you old sinner,” she went on, turning to the count<br>who was kissing her hand, “you’re feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay?<br>Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just<br>see how these nestlings are growing up,” and she pointed to the girls.<br>“You must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not....”<br><br>“Well,” said she, “how’s my Cossack?” (Márya Dmítrievna<br>always called Natásha a Cossack) and she stroked the child’s arm as<br>she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. “I know she’s a scamp<br>of a girl, but I like her.”<br><br>She took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and,<br>having given them to the rosy Natásha, who beamed with the pleasure<br>of her saint’s-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to<br>Pierre.<br><br>“Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,” said she, assuming a soft high<br>tone of voice. “Come here, my friend...” and she ominously tucked<br>up her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a<br>childlike way through his spectacles.<br><br>“Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell<br>your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it’s my<br>evident duty.” She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to<br>follow, for this was clearly only a prelude.<br><br>“A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed<br>and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame,<br>sir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war.”<br><br>She turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep<br>from laughing.<br><br>“Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?” said Márya<br>Dmítrievna.<br><br>The count went in first with Márya Dmítrievna, the countess followed<br>on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because<br>Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikháylovna<br>with Shinshín. Berg gave his arm to Véra. The smiling Julie Karágina<br>went in with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the<br>whole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses<br>followed singly. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the<br>band struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their<br>places. Then the strains of the count’s household band were replaced<br>by the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the<br>soft steps of the footmen. At one end of the table sat the countess with<br>Márya Dmítrievna on her right and Anna Mikháylovna on her left, the<br>other lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count,<br>with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshín and the other male<br>visitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the<br>grown-up young people: Véra beside Berg, and Pierre beside Borís; and<br>on the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind<br>the crystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his<br>wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled<br>his neighbors’ glasses, not neglecting his own. The countess in turn,<br>without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from<br>behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed<br>by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the<br>ladies’ end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the<br>men’s end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the<br>colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so<br>much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg<br>with tender smiles was saying to Véra that love is not an earthly but<br>a heavenly feeling. Borís was telling his new friend Pierre who the<br>guests were and exchanging glances with Natásha, who was sitting<br>opposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a<br>great deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and<br>went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines.<br>These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a<br>napkin, from behind the next man’s shoulders and whispered: “Dry<br>Madeira”... “Hungarian”... or “Rhine wine” as the case might<br>be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count’s monogram<br>that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank<br>with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other<br>guests. Natásha, who sat opposite, was looking at Borís as girls of<br>thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for<br>the first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny<br>lively little girl’s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing<br>why.<br><br>Nicholas sat at some distance from Sónya, beside Julie Karágina, to<br>whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. Sónya wore<br>a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned<br>pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas<br>and Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept looking round<br>uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the<br>children. The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines,<br>and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner<br>to his people in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler<br>with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to<br>appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because<br>no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from<br>greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for<br>knowledge.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIX<br><br>At the men’s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated.<br>The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared<br>in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day<br>been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief.<br><br>“And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?” remarked<br>Shinshín. “He has stopped Austria’s cackle and I fear it will be<br>our turn next.”<br><br>The colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to<br>the service and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinshín’s remark.<br><br>“It is for the reasson, my goot sir,” said he, speaking with a<br>German accent, “for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He<br>declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger<br>vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell<br>as ze sanctity of its alliances...” he spoke this last word with<br>particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.<br><br>Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he<br>repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:<br><br>... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor’s sole and absolute<br>aim—to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations—has now decided<br>him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition<br>for the attainment of that purpose.<br><br>“Zat, my dear sir, is vy...” he concluded, drinking a tumbler of<br>wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval.<br><br>“Connaissez-vous le Proverbe:* ‘Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but<br>turn spindles at home!’?” said Shinshín, puckering his brows and<br>smiling. “Cela nous convient à merveille.*(2) Suvórov now—he knew<br>what he was about; yet they beat him à plate couture,*(3) and where<br>are we to find Suvórovs now? Je vous demande un peu,” *(4) said he,<br>continually changing from French to Russian.<br><br>     *Do you know the proverb?<br><br>     *(2) That suits us down to the ground.<br><br>     *(3) Hollow.<br><br>     *(4) I just ask you that.<br><br>“Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!” said the colonel,<br>thumping the table; “and ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill<br>pe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible”... he dwelt<br>particularly on the word possible... “as po-o-ossible,” he ended,<br>again turning to the count. “Zat is how ve old hussars look at it, and<br>zere’s an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar,<br>how do you judge of it?” he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he<br>heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with<br>eyes and ears intent on the colonel.<br><br>“I am quite of your opinion,” replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning<br>his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision<br>and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great<br>danger. “I am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer,” he<br>concluded, conscious—as were others—after the words were uttered<br>that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and<br>were therefore awkward.<br><br>“What you said just now was splendid!” said his partner Julie.<br><br>Sónya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and<br>down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.<br><br>Pierre listened to the colonel’s speech and nodded approvingly.<br><br>“That’s fine,” said he.<br><br>“The young man’s a real hussar!” shouted the colonel, again<br>thumping the table.<br><br>“What are you making such a noise about over there?” Márya<br>Dmítrievna’s deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the<br>table. “What are you thumping the table for?” she demanded of the<br>hussar, “and why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French<br>are here?”<br><br>“I am speaking ze truce,” replied the hussar with a smile.<br><br>“It’s all about the war,” the count shouted down the table. “You<br>know my son’s going, Márya Dmítrievna? My son is going.”<br><br>“I have four sons in the army but still I don’t fret. It is all<br>in God’s hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a<br>battle,” replied Márya Dmítrievna’s deep voice, which easily<br>carried the whole length of the table.<br><br>“That’s true!”<br><br>Once more the conversations concentrated, the ladies’ at the one end<br>and the men’s at the other.<br><br>“You won’t ask,” Natásha’s little brother was saying; “I know<br>you won’t ask!”<br><br>“I will,” replied Natásha.<br><br>Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half<br>rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what<br>was coming, and turning to her mother:<br><br>“Mamma!” rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice,<br>audible the whole length of the table.<br><br>“What is it?” asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her<br>daughter’s face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her<br>sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.<br><br>The conversation was hushed.<br><br>“Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?” and Natásha’s voice<br>sounded still more firm and resolute.<br><br>The countess tried to frown, but could not. Márya Dmítrievna shook her<br>fat finger.<br><br>“Cossack!” she said threateningly.<br><br>Most of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the<br>elders.<br><br>“You had better take care!” said the countess.<br><br>“Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?” Natásha again cried<br>boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in<br>good part.<br><br>Sónya and fat little Pétya doubled up with laughter.<br><br>“You see! I have asked,” whispered Natásha to her little brother<br>and to Pierre, glancing at him again.<br><br>“Ice pudding, but you won’t get any,” said Márya Dmítrievna.<br><br>Natásha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even<br>Márya Dmítrievna.<br><br>“Márya Dmítrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don’t like ice<br>cream.”<br><br>“Carrot ices.”<br><br>“No! What kind, Márya Dmítrievna? What kind?” she almost screamed;<br>“I want to know!”<br><br>Márya Dmítrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the<br>guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at Márya Dmítrievna’s answer<br>but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had<br>dared to treat Márya Dmítrievna in this fashion.<br><br>Natásha only desisted when she had been told that there would be<br>pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band<br>again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving<br>their seats, went up to “congratulate” the countess, and reached<br>across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and<br>with one another. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and<br>in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the<br>guests returned to the drawing room and to the count’s study.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XX<br><br>The card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the<br>count’s visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms,<br>some in the sitting room, some in the library.<br><br>The count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from<br>dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything.<br>The young people, at the countess’ instigation, gathered round the<br>clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played first. After she<br>had played a little air with variations on the harp, she joined the<br>other young ladies in begging Natásha and Nicholas, who were noted for<br>their musical talent, to sing something. Natásha, who was treated as<br>though she were grown up, was evidently very proud of this but at the<br>same time felt shy.<br><br>“What shall we sing?” she said.<br><br>“‘The Brook,’” suggested Nicholas.<br><br>“Well, then, let’s be quick. Borís, come here,” said Natásha.<br>“But where is Sónya?”<br><br>She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to<br>look for her.<br><br>Running into Sónya’s room and not finding her there, Natásha ran to<br>the nursery, but Sónya was not there either. Natásha concluded that<br>she must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage was<br>the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rostóv<br>household. And there in fact was Sónya lying face downward on Nurse’s<br>dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink<br>dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing<br>so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook. Natásha’s<br>face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saint’s day, suddenly<br>changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad<br>neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.<br><br>“Sónya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!” And<br>Natásha’s large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she<br>began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sónya was<br>crying. Sónya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and<br>hid her face still deeper in the bed. Natásha wept, sitting on the<br>blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort Sónya<br>sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining.<br><br>“Nicholas is going away in a week’s time, his... papers... have<br>come... he told me himself... but still I should not cry,” and she<br>showed a paper she held in her hand—with the verses Nicholas had<br>written, “still, I should not cry, but you can’t... no one can<br>understand... what a soul he has!”<br><br>And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.<br><br>“It’s all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and<br>Borís also,” she went on, gaining a little strength; “he is nice...<br>there are no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin...<br>one would have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it<br>can’t be done. And besides, if she tells Mamma” (Sónya looked upon<br>the countess as her mother and called her so) “that I am spoiling<br>Nicholas’ career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God<br>is my witness,” and she made the sign of the cross, “I love her so<br>much, and all of you, only Véra... And what for? What have I done<br>to her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice<br>everything, only I have nothing....”<br><br>Sónya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in<br>the feather bed. Natásha began consoling her, but her face showed that<br>she understood all the gravity of her friend’s trouble.<br><br>“Sónya,” she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true<br>reason of her friend’s sorrow, “I’m sure Véra has said something<br>to you since dinner? Hasn’t she?”<br><br>“Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others,<br>and she found them on my table and said she’d show them to Mamma, and<br>that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry<br>me, but that he’ll marry Julie. You see how he’s been with her all<br>day... Natásha, what have I done to deserve it?...”<br><br>And again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natásha lifted<br>her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting<br>her.<br><br>“Sónya, don’t believe her, darling! Don’t believe her! Do you<br>remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting<br>room after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I don’t<br>quite remember how, but don’t you remember that it could all be<br>arranged and how nice it all was? There’s Uncle Shinshín’s brother<br>has married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know.<br>And Borís says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all about<br>it. And he is so clever and so good!” said Natásha. “Don’t<br>you cry, Sónya, dear love, darling Sónya!” and she kissed her and<br>laughed. “Véra’s spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right<br>and she won’t say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself,<br>and he doesn’t care at all for Julie.”<br><br>Natásha kissed her on the hair.<br><br>Sónya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it<br>seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin<br>playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.<br><br>“Do you think so?... Really? Truly?” she said, quickly smoothing her<br>frock and hair.<br><br>“Really, truly!” answered Natásha, pushing in a crisp lock that had<br>strayed from under her friend’s plaits.<br><br>Both laughed.<br><br>“Well, let’s go and sing ‘The Brook.’”<br><br>“Come along!”<br><br>“Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!” said<br>Natásha, stopping suddenly. “I feel so happy!”<br><br>And she set off at a run along the passage.<br><br>Sónya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the<br>verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran<br>after Natásha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face<br>and light, joyous steps. At the visitors’ request the young people<br>sang the quartette, “The Brook,” with which everyone was delighted.<br>Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:<br><br>   At nighttime in the moon’s fair glow<br>     How sweet, as fancies wander free,<br>   To feel that in this world there’s one<br>     Who still is thinking but of thee!<br><br>   That while her fingers touch the harp<br>     Wafting sweet music o’er the lea,<br>   It is for thee thus swells her heart,<br>     Sighing its message out to thee...<br><br>   A day or two, then bliss unspoilt,<br>     But oh! till then I cannot live!...<br><br>He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to<br>get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the<br>coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.<br><br><br>Pierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinshín had engaged him,<br>as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in<br>which several others joined but which bored Pierre. When the music began<br>Natásha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and<br>blushing:<br><br>“Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.”<br><br>“I am afraid of mixing the figures,” Pierre replied; “but if you<br>will be my teacher...” And lowering his big arm he offered it to the<br>slender little girl.<br><br>While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up,<br>Pierre sat down with his little partner. Natásha was perfectly happy;<br>she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She was<br>sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady.<br>She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold.<br>Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where<br>she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and<br>smiling over the fan.<br><br>“Dear, dear! Just look at her!” exclaimed the countess as she<br>crossed the ballroom, pointing to Natásha.<br><br>Natásha blushed and laughed.<br><br>“Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised<br>at?”<br><br><br>In the midst of the third écossaise there was a clatter of chairs being<br>pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Márya Dmítrievna<br>had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and<br>older visitors. They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long,<br>and replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom. First<br>came Márya Dmítrievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The<br>count, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his<br>bent arm to Márya Dmítrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair<br>gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the<br>écossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted<br>up to their gallery, addressing the first violin:<br><br>“Semën! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?”<br><br>This was the count’s favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth.<br>(Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.)<br><br>“Look at Papa!” shouted Natásha to the whole company, and quite<br>forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her<br>curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.<br><br>And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the<br>jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner,<br>Márya Dmítrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his<br>shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by<br>a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the<br>onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay<br>strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant<br>dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly<br>filled by the domestic serfs—the men on one side and the women on<br>the other—who with beaming faces had come to see their master making<br>merry.<br><br>“Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!” loudly remarked<br>the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.<br><br>The count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not<br>want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms<br>hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her<br>stern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed<br>by the whole of the count’s plump figure, in Márya Dmítrievna found<br>expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose.<br>But if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed<br>the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and<br>the agility with which he capered about on his light feet, Márya<br>Dmítrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions—the least<br>effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp<br>her foot—which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual<br>severity. The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could<br>not attract a moment’s attention to their own evolutions and did not<br>even try to do so. All were watching the count and Márya Dmítrievna.<br>Natásha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to<br>“look at Papa!” though as it was they never took their eyes off the<br>couple. In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved<br>and shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster;<br>lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying<br>round Márya Dmítrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until,<br>turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas,<br>raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling<br>and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and<br>laughter led by Natásha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily<br>and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.<br><br>“That’s how we used to dance in our time, ma chère,” said the<br>count.<br><br>“That was a Daniel Cooper!” exclaimed Márya Dmítrievna, tucking up<br>her sleeves and puffing heavily.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXI<br><br>While in the Rostóvs’ ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced,<br>to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired<br>footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count Bezúkhov had a<br>sixth stroke. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a mute<br>confession, communion was administered to the dying man, preparations<br>made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle<br>and thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond<br>the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up,<br>waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral.<br>The Military Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending<br>aides-de-camp to inquire after the count’s health, came himself<br>that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of<br>Catherine’s court, Count Bezúkhov.<br><br>The magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up<br>respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an<br>hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their<br>bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed<br>on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince<br>Vasíli, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days,<br>escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times in<br>low tones.<br><br>When the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasíli sat down all alone<br>on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other,<br>leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand. After<br>sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened<br>eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading<br>to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess.<br><br>Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous<br>whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man’s<br>room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at<br>his door, which creaked slightly when opened.<br><br>“The limits of human life ... are fixed and may not be<br>o’erpassed,” said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat<br>beside him and was listening naïvely to his words.<br><br>“I wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?” asked the<br>lady, adding the priest’s clerical title, as if she had no opinion of<br>her own on the subject.<br><br>“Ah, madam, it is a great sacrament,” replied the priest, passing<br>his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his<br>bald head.<br><br>“Who was that? The Military Governor himself?” was being asked at<br>the other side of the room. “How young-looking he is!”<br><br>“Yes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes<br>anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.”<br><br>“I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.”<br><br>The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red<br>from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a<br>graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a<br>table.<br><br>“Beautiful,” said the doctor in answer to a remark about the<br>weather. “The weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow<br>one feels as if one were in the country.”<br><br>“Yes, indeed,” replied the princess with a sigh. “So he may have<br>something to drink?”<br><br>Lorrain considered.<br><br>“Has he taken his medicine?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>The doctor glanced at his watch.<br><br>“Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,”<br>and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.<br><br>“Dere has neffer been a gase,” a German doctor was saying to an<br>aide-de-camp, “dat one liffs after de sird stroke.”<br><br>“And what a well-preserved man he was!” remarked the aide-de-camp.<br>“And who will inherit his wealth?” he added in a whisper.<br><br>“It von’t go begging,” replied the German with a smile.<br><br>Everyone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second<br>princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to<br>Lorrain’s instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.<br><br>“Do you think he can last till morning?” asked the German,<br>addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.<br><br>Lorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before<br>his nose.<br><br>“Tonight, not later,” said he in a low voice, and he moved away<br>with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to<br>understand and state the patient’s condition.<br><br>Meanwhile Prince Vasíli had opened the door into the princess’ room.<br><br>In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before<br>the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles.<br>The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots,<br>cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was<br>just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bark.<br><br>“Ah, is it you, cousin?”<br><br>She rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth<br>that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with<br>varnish.<br><br>“Has anything happened?” she asked. “I am so terrified.”<br><br>“No, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business,<br>Catiche,” * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair<br>she had just vacated. “You have made the place warm, I must say,” he<br>remarked. “Well, sit down: let’s have a talk.”<br><br>     *Catherine.<br><br>“I thought perhaps something had happened,” she said with her<br>unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the<br>prince, she prepared to listen.<br><br>“I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can’t.”<br><br>“Well, my dear?” said Prince Vasíli, taking her hand and bending it<br>downwards as was his habit.<br><br>It was plain that this “well?” referred to much that they both<br>understood without naming.<br><br>The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her<br>legs, looked directly at Prince Vasíli with no sign of emotion in her<br>prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons<br>with a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow<br>and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince<br>Vasíli understood it as an expression of weariness.<br><br>“And I?” he said; “do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn<br>out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a<br>very serious talk.”<br><br>Prince Vasíli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously,<br>now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant<br>expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes<br>too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the<br>next glanced round in alarm.<br><br>The princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony<br>hands, looked attentively into Prince Vasíli’s eyes evidently<br>resolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till<br>morning.<br><br>“Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semënovna,”<br>continued Prince Vasíli, returning to his theme, apparently not<br>without an inner struggle; “at such a moment as this one must think<br>of everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you<br>all, like children of my own, as you know.”<br><br>The princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same<br>dull expression.<br><br>“And then of course my family has also to be considered,” Prince<br>Vasíli went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at<br>her. “You know, Catiche, that we—you three sisters, Mámontov, and<br>my wife—are the count’s only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard<br>it is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for<br>me; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for<br>anything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,” pointing to<br>his portrait, “definitely demanded that he should be called.”<br><br>Prince Vasíli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make<br>out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was<br>simply looking at him.<br><br>“There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,” she<br>replied, “and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow<br>his noble soul peacefully to leave this...”<br><br>“Yes, yes, of course,” interrupted Prince Vasíli impatiently,<br>rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little<br>table that he had pushed away. “But... in short, the fact is... you<br>know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left<br>all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.”<br><br>“He has made wills enough!” quietly remarked the princess. “But he<br>cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.”<br><br>“But, my dear,” said Prince Vasíli suddenly, clutching the little<br>table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: “what if<br>a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for<br>Pierre’s legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the<br>count’s services, his request would be granted?...”<br><br>The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the<br>subject under discussion than those they are talking with.<br><br>“I can tell you more,” continued Prince Vasíli, seizing her hand,<br>“that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew<br>of it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then<br>as soon as all is over,” and Prince Vasíli sighed to intimate what he<br>meant by the words all is over, “and the count’s papers are opened,<br>the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition<br>will certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate<br>son.”<br><br>“And our share?” asked the princess smiling ironically, as if<br>anything might happen, only not that.<br><br>“But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the<br>legal heir to everything and you won’t get anything. You must know,<br>my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have<br>been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you<br>ought to know where they are, and must find them, because...”<br><br>“What next?” the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not<br>changing the expression of her eyes. “I am a woman, and you think we<br>are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit...<br>un bâtard!”* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the<br>word would effectively prove to Prince Vasíli the invalidity of his<br>contention.<br><br>     * A bastard.<br><br>“Well, really, Catiche! Can’t you understand! You are so<br>intelligent, how is it you don’t see that if the count has written a<br>letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it<br>follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bezúkhov,<br>and will then inherit everything under the will? And if the will and<br>letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation<br>of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s’ensuit!* That’s certain.”<br><br>     * And all that follows therefrom.<br><br>“I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid;<br>and you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool,” said the<br>princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are<br>saying something witty and stinging.<br><br>“My dear Princess Catherine Semënovna,” began Prince Vasíli<br>impatiently, “I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about<br>your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I<br>tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the<br>will in Pierre’s favor are among the count’s papers, then, my dear<br>girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you don’t believe me,<br>then believe an expert. I have just been talking to Dmítri Onúfrich”<br>(the family solicitor) “and he says the same.”<br><br>At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess’ ideas;<br>her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice<br>when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself<br>evidently did not expect.<br><br>“That would be a fine thing!” said she. “I never wanted anything<br>and I don’t now.”<br><br>She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.<br><br>“And this is gratitude—this is recognition for those who have<br>sacrificed everything for his sake!” she cried. “It’s splendid!<br>Fine! I don’t want anything, Prince.”<br><br>“Yes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters...”<br>replied Prince Vasíli.<br><br>But the princess did not listen to him.<br><br>“Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect<br>nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitude—the<br>blackest ingratitude—in this house...”<br><br>“Do you or do you not know where that will is?” insisted Prince<br>Vasíli, his cheeks twitching more than ever.<br><br>“Yes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and<br>sacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has<br>been intriguing!”<br><br>The princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She<br>had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race.<br>She gave her companion an angry glance.<br><br>“There is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was<br>all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards<br>forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his<br>last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let<br>him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...”<br><br>“Who sacrificed everything for him,” chimed in the princess, who<br>would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, “though<br>he never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin,” she added with a sigh,<br>“I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward,<br>that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one<br>has to be cunning and cruel.”<br><br>“Now come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.”<br><br>“No, I have a wicked heart.”<br><br>“I know your heart,” repeated the prince. “I value your friendship<br>and wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Don’t upset yourself,<br>and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it<br>but an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where<br>it is. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to the<br>count. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it.<br>You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his<br>wishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help him<br>and you.”<br><br>“Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguing—I know!” cried<br>the princess.<br><br>“That’s not the point, my dear.”<br><br>“It’s that protégé of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetskáya,<br>that Anna Mikháylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the<br>infamous, vile woman!”<br><br>“Do not let us lose any time...”<br><br>“Ah, don’t talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and<br>told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about<br>Sophie—I can’t repeat them—that it made the count quite ill and he<br>would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote this<br>vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid.”<br><br>“We’ve got to it at last—why did you not tell me about it<br>sooner?”<br><br>“It’s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,”<br>said the princess, ignoring his question. “Now I know! Yes; if I have<br>a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!” almost shrieked<br>the princess, now quite changed. “And what does she come worming<br>herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time<br>will come!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXII<br><br>While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the<br>princess’ room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for)<br>and Anna Mikháylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was<br>driving into the court of Count Bezúkhov’s house. As the wheels<br>rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikháylovna,<br>having turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that<br>he was asleep in his corner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre<br>followed Anna Mikháylovna out of the carriage, and only then began<br>to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him. He<br>noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back<br>door. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who<br>looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the<br>shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other<br>men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides.<br>But neither Anna Mikháylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who<br>could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. “It seems<br>to be all right,” Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikháylovna.<br>She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to<br>Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it<br>was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had<br>to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikháylovna’s air<br>of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely<br>necessary. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by<br>some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots<br>clattering. These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna<br>Mikháylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them<br>there.<br><br>“Is this the way to the princesses’ apartments?” asked Anna<br>Mikháylovna of one of them.<br><br>“Yes,” replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were<br>now permissible; “the door to the left, ma’am.”<br><br>“Perhaps the count did not ask for me,” said Pierre when he reached<br>the landing. “I’d better go to my own room.”<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna paused and waited for him to come up.<br><br>“Ah, my friend!” she said, touching his arm as she had done her<br>son’s when speaking to him that afternoon, “believe me I suffer no<br>less than you do, but be a man!”<br><br>“But really, hadn’t I better go away?” he asked, looking kindly at<br>her over his spectacles.<br><br>“Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you.<br>Think that he is your father ... perhaps in the agony of death.” She<br>sighed. “I have loved you like a son from the first. Trust yourself to<br>me, Pierre. I shall not forget your interests.”<br><br>Pierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had<br>to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikháylovna who was<br>already opening a door.<br><br>This door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the<br>princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been<br>in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of<br>these rooms. Anna Mikháylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past<br>with a decanter on a tray as “my dear” and “my sweet,” asked<br>about the princess’ health and then led Pierre along a stone passage.<br>The first door on the left led into the princesses’ apartments. The<br>maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything<br>in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna<br>Mikháylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where<br>Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess were sitting close together<br>talking. Seeing them pass, Prince Vasíli drew back with obvious<br>impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of<br>desperation slammed the door with all her might.<br><br>This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on<br>Prince Vasíli’s face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre<br>stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide. Anna<br>Mikháylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as<br>if to say that this was no more than she had expected.<br><br>“Be a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,” said she in<br>reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.<br><br>Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what<br>“watching over his interests” meant, but he decided that all these<br>things had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly<br>lit room adjoining the count’s reception room. It was one of those<br>sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front<br>approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water<br>had been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer<br>and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They<br>went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian<br>windows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full<br>length portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still<br>sitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one<br>another. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna<br>Mikháylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who,<br>hanging his head, meekly followed her.<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna’s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive<br>moment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now,<br>keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than<br>that afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the<br>dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid<br>glance at all those in the room and noticing the count’s confessor<br>there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet<br>seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing<br>first of one and then of another priest.<br><br>“God be thanked that you are in time,” said she to one of the<br>priests; “all we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young<br>man is the count’s son,” she added more softly. “What a terrible<br>moment!”<br><br>Having said this she went up to the doctor.<br><br>“Dear doctor,” said she, “this young man is the count’s son. Is<br>there any hope?”<br><br>The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his<br>shoulders. Anna Mikháylovna with just the same movement raised her<br>shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away<br>from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and<br>tenderly sad voice, she said:<br><br>“Trust in His mercy!” and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit<br>and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was<br>watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.<br><br>Pierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved<br>toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikháylovna had<br>disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him<br>with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they<br>whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind<br>of awe and even servility. A deference such as he had never before<br>received was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to<br>the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up<br>and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully<br>silent as he passed by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre<br>wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to<br>pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not<br>even in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and<br>that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful<br>rite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound<br>to accept their services. He took the glove in silence from the<br>aide-de-camp, and sat down in the lady’s chair, placing his huge hands<br>symmetrically on his knees in the naïve attitude of an Egyptian statue,<br>and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in<br>order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his<br>own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of<br>those who were guiding him.<br><br>Not two minutes had passed before Prince Vasíli with head erect<br>majestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three<br>stars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning;<br>his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed<br>Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do),<br>and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly<br>fixed on.<br><br>“Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is<br>well!” and he turned to go.<br><br>But Pierre thought it necessary to ask: “How is...” and hesitated,<br>not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man “the<br>count,” yet ashamed to call him “father.”<br><br>“He had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my<br>friend...”<br><br>Pierre’s mind was in such a confused state that the word “stroke”<br>suggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vasíli<br>in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of<br>illness. Prince Vasíli said something to Lorrain in passing and went<br>through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his<br>whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and<br>the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door.<br>Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and<br>at last Anna Mikháylovna, still with the same expression, pale but<br>resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly<br>on the arm said:<br><br>“The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be<br>administered. Come.”<br><br>Pierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed<br>that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all<br>followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to<br>enter that room.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXIII<br><br>Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its<br>walls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind the<br>columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and<br>on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated<br>with red light like a Russian church during evening service. Under<br>the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair<br>on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre<br>saw—covered to the waist by a bright green quilt—the familiar,<br>majestic figure of his father, Count Bezúkhov, with that gray mane of<br>hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep<br>characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face. He lay<br>just under the icons; his large thick hands outside the quilt. Into the<br>right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust<br>between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from<br>behind the chair, held it in position. By the chair stood the priests,<br>their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments,<br>with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the<br>service. A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding<br>handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest<br>sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on<br>the icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for<br>herself should she glance round. Anna Mikháylovna, with a meek,<br>sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door<br>near the strange lady. Prince Vasíli in front of the door, near the<br>invalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on<br>the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose,<br>and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward<br>each time he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety<br>and resignation to the will of God. “If you do not understand these<br>sentiments,” he seemed to be saying, “so much the worse for you!”<br><br>Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants;<br>the men and women had separated as in church. All were silently crossing<br>themselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting<br>of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of<br>feet were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna Mikháylovna, with<br>an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she<br>was about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave<br>him a taper. He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him,<br>began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper.<br><br>Sophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole,<br>watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained<br>with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she<br>again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him<br>without laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of<br>temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In the midst<br>of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered<br>to one another, and the old servant who was holding the count’s hand<br>got up and said something to the ladies. Anna Mikháylovna stepped<br>forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from<br>behind her back. The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning<br>against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he,<br>a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full<br>importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it. He<br>now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor<br>of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the<br>hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected<br>a moment. The sick man was given something to drink, there was a<br>stir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service<br>continued. During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasíli<br>left the chair on which he had been leaning, and—with an air<br>which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not<br>understand him it was so much the worse for them—did not go up to the<br>dying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved<br>with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its<br>silken hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince Vasíli and the princess<br>passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the<br>other before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention<br>to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his<br>mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was<br>in some way essential.<br><br>The chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was<br>heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the<br>sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around<br>him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which<br>Anna Mikháylovna’s was the most distinct.<br><br>Pierre heard her say:<br><br>“Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be<br>impossible...”<br><br>The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants<br>that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray<br>mane—which, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight<br>of for a single moment during the whole service. He judged by the<br>cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that<br>they had lifted the dying man and were moving him.<br><br>“Catch hold of my arm or you’ll drop him!” he heard one of the<br>servants say in a frightened whisper. “Catch hold from underneath.<br>Here!” exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the<br>bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the<br>weight they were carrying were too much for them.<br><br>As the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikháylovna, passed the young man<br>he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying<br>man’s high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by<br>those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly,<br>leonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones,<br>its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was<br>not disfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as Pierre<br>remembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to<br>Petersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven<br>movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon<br>nothing.<br><br>After a few minutes’ bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had<br>carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikháylovna touched Pierre’s<br>hand and said, “Come.” Pierre went with her to the bed on which the<br>sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony<br>just completed. He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His<br>hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms<br>downward. When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but<br>with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal<br>man. Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes<br>they must look somewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated,<br>not knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna<br>Mikháylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick<br>man’s hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre,<br>carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her<br>suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand. Neither<br>the hand nor a single muscle of the count’s face stirred. Once more<br>Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikháylovna to see what he was to<br>do next. Anna Mikháylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood<br>beside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were<br>doing right. Anna Mikháylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell<br>into the naïvely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently<br>distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing<br>his utmost to look as small as possible. He looked at the count, who<br>still gazed at the spot where Pierre’s face had been before he sat<br>down. Anna Mikháylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of<br>the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the<br>father and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an<br>hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count’s face began<br>to twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one<br>side (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and<br>from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna<br>Mikháylovna looked attentively at the sick man’s eyes, trying to<br>guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink,<br>then named Prince Vasíli in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the<br>quilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. He made an<br>effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the<br>bed.<br><br>“Wants to turn on the other side,” whispered the servant, and got up<br>to turn the count’s heavy body toward the wall.<br><br>Pierre rose to help him.<br><br>While the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back<br>helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether he<br>noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm,<br>or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any<br>rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre’s terror-stricken<br>face, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile<br>appeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride<br>his own helplessness. At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected<br>quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his<br>eyes. The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall.<br>He sighed.<br><br>“He is dozing,” said Anna Mikháylovna, observing that one of the<br>princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. “Let us go.”<br><br>Pierre went out.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXIV<br><br>There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasíli and the<br>eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the<br>Great and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion<br>they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide<br>something as she whispered:<br><br>“I can’t bear the sight of that woman.”<br><br>“Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,” said Prince<br>Vasíli to Anna Mikháylovna. “Go and take something, my poor Anna<br>Mikháylovna, or you will not hold out.”<br><br>To Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze<br>below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna Mikháylovna into the small<br>drawing room.<br><br>“There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup<br>of this delicious Russian tea,” Lorrain was saying with an air of<br>restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese<br>handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid<br>in the small circular room. Around the table all who were at Count<br>Bezúkhov’s house that night had gathered to fortify themselves.<br>Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors<br>and little tables. During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not<br>know how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies<br>who, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and<br>pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly<br>lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times. Now<br>this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small table tea<br>things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the<br>night a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly<br>whispering, and betraying by every word and movement that they none<br>of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the<br>bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have<br>liked to. He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was<br>again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince<br>Vasíli and the eldest princess. Pierre concluded that this also was<br>essential, and after a short interval followed her. Anna Mikháylovna<br>was standing beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited<br>whispers.<br><br>“Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not<br>necessary,” said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the<br>same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.<br><br>“But, my dear princess,” answered Anna Mikháylovna blandly but<br>impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other<br>from passing, “won’t this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment<br>when he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is<br>already prepared...”<br><br>Prince Vasíli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude,<br>with one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which were so<br>flabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching violently; but<br>he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were<br>saying.<br><br>“Come, my dear Anna Mikháylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases. You<br>know how fond the count is of her.”<br><br>“I don’t even know what is in this paper,” said the younger of<br>the two ladies, addressing Prince Vasíli and pointing to an inlaid<br>portfolio she held in her hand. “All I know is that his real will is<br>in his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten....”<br><br>She tried to pass Anna Mikháylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar<br>her path.<br><br>“I know, my dear, kind princess,” said Anna Mikháylovna, seizing<br>the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily.<br>“Dear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je vous<br>en conjure...”<br><br>The princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the<br>portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if<br>the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna<br>Mikháylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none<br>of its honeyed firmness and softness.<br><br>“Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a<br>family consultation; is it not so, Prince?”<br><br>“Why don’t you speak, cousin?” suddenly shrieked the princess so<br>loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. “Why<br>do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to<br>interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man’s room?<br>Intriguer!” she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the<br>portfolio.<br><br>But Anna Mikháylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the<br>portfolio, and changed her grip.<br><br>Prince Vasíli rose. “Oh!” said he with reproach and surprise,<br>“this is absurd! Come, let go I tell you.”<br><br>The princess let go.<br><br>“And you too!”<br><br>But Anna Mikháylovna did not obey him.<br><br>“Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. I myself will go<br>and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?”<br><br>“But, Prince,” said Anna Mikháylovna, “after such a solemn<br>sacrament, allow him a moment’s peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your<br>opinion,” said she, turning to the young man who, having come quite<br>close, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess<br>which had lost all dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince<br>Vasíli.<br><br>“Remember that you will answer for the consequences,” said Prince<br>Vasíli severely. “You don’t know what you are doing.”<br><br>“Vile woman!” shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna<br>Mikháylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.<br><br>Prince Vasíli bent his head and spread out his hands.<br><br>At this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long<br>and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged<br>against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out<br>wringing her hands.<br><br>“What are you doing!” she cried vehemently. “He is dying and you<br>leave me alone with him!”<br><br>Her sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikháylovna, stooping, quickly<br>caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom. The eldest<br>princess and Prince Vasíli, recovering themselves, followed her. A few<br>minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again<br>biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression showed an<br>irrepressible hatred.<br><br>“Yes, now you may be glad!” said she; “this is what you have<br>been waiting for.” And bursting into tears she hid her face in her<br>handkerchief and rushed from the room.<br><br>Prince Vasíli came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was<br>sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre<br>noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an<br>ague.<br><br>“Ah, my friend!” said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was<br>in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it<br>before. “How often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am<br>near sixty, dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all! Death is<br>awful...” and he burst into tears.<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet<br>steps.<br><br>“Pierre!” she said.<br><br>Pierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his<br>forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said:<br><br>“He is no more....”<br><br>Pierre looked at her over his spectacles.<br><br>“Come, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as<br>tears.”<br><br>She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could<br>see his face. Anna Mikháylovna left him, and when she returned he was<br>fast asleep with his head on his arm.<br><br>In the morning Anna Mikháylovna said to Pierre:<br><br>“Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you.<br>But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command<br>of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you<br>well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes<br>duties on you, and you must be a man.”<br><br>Pierre was silent.<br><br>“Perhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been<br>there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised<br>me only the day before yesterday not to forget Borís. But he had<br>no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father’s<br>wish?”<br><br>Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in<br>silence at Princess Anna Mikháylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna<br>Mikháylovna returned to the Rostóvs’ and went to bed. On waking in<br>the morning she told the Rostóvs and all her acquaintances the details<br>of Count Bezúkhov’s death. She said the count had died as she would<br>herself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but edifying. As<br>to the last meeting between father and son, it was so touching that she<br>could not think of it without tears, and did not know which had behaved<br>better during those awful moments—the father who so remembered<br>everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to<br>the son, or Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he<br>with grief, though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his<br>dying father. “It is painful, but it does one good. It uplifts the<br>soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son,” said she.<br>Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince Vasíli she spoke<br>disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXV<br><br>At Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andréevich Bolkónski’s estate, the<br>arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but<br>this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old<br>prince’s household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andréevich<br>(nicknamed in society, “the King of Prussia”) ever since the Emperor<br>Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously<br>with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the<br>capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that<br>anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to<br>Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to<br>say that there are only two sources of human vice—idleness and<br>superstition, and only two virtues—activity and intelligence. He<br>himself undertook his daughter’s education, and to develop these two<br>cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry<br>till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was<br>occupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving<br>problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working<br>in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on<br>at his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity,<br>regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of<br>exactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same conditions,<br>and not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With those about<br>him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably<br>exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear<br>and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused. Although he was<br>in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high<br>official appointed to the province in which the prince’s estate lay<br>considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber<br>just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince<br>appeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this<br>antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when<br>the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather<br>small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray<br>eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd,<br>youthfully glittering eyes.<br><br>On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princess<br>Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the<br>morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a<br>silent prayer. Every morning she came in like that, and every morning<br>prayed that the daily interview might pass off well.<br><br>An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose<br>quietly and said in a whisper: “Please walk in.”<br><br>Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess timidly<br>opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused at the<br>entrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round<br>continued his work.<br><br>The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use.<br>The large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted<br>bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while<br>standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with<br>tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around—all indicated<br>continuous, varied, and orderly activity. The motion of the small foot<br>shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and the firm pressure<br>of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the<br>tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age. After a few more turns<br>of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel,<br>dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching<br>the table, summoned his daughter. He never gave his children a blessing,<br>so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding<br>her tenderly and attentively, said severely:<br><br>“Quite well? All right then, sit down.” He took the exercise book<br>containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair<br>with his foot.<br><br>“For tomorrow!” said he, quickly finding the page and making a<br>scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.<br><br>The princess bent over the exercise book on the table.<br><br>“Wait a bit, here’s a letter for you,” said the old man suddenly,<br>taking a letter addressed in a woman’s hand from a bag hanging above<br>the table, onto which he threw it.<br><br>At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the<br>princess’ face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it.<br><br>“From Héloïse?” asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his<br>still sound, yellowish teeth.<br><br>“Yes, it’s from Julie,” replied the princess with a timid glance<br>and a timid smile.<br><br>“I’ll let two more letters pass, but the third I’ll read,” said<br>the prince sternly; “I’m afraid you write much nonsense. I’ll read<br>the third!”<br><br>“Read this if you like, Father,” said the princess, blushing still<br>more and holding out the letter.<br><br>“The third, I said the third!” cried the prince abruptly, pushing<br>the letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him<br>the exercise book containing geometrical figures.<br><br>“Well, madam,” he began, stooping over the book close to his<br>daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat,<br>so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of<br>old age and tobacco, which she had known so long. “Now, madam, these<br>triangles are equal; please note that the angle ABC...”<br><br>The princess looked in a scared way at her father’s eyes glittering<br>close to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was<br>plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her<br>fear would prevent her understanding any of her father’s further<br>explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the<br>teacher’s fault or the pupil’s, this same thing happened every day:<br>the princess’ eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear<br>anything, but was only conscious of her stern father’s withered face<br>close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only<br>of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in<br>peace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which he was<br>sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control himself<br>and not become vehement, but almost always did become vehement, scolded,<br>and sometimes flung the exercise book away.<br><br>The princess gave a wrong answer.<br><br>“Well now, isn’t she a fool!” shouted the prince, pushing the book<br>aside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up and<br>down, lightly touched his daughter’s hair and sat down again.<br><br>He drew up his chair, and continued to explain.<br><br>“This won’t do, Princess; it won’t do,” said he, when Princess<br>Mary, having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day’s<br>lesson, was about to leave: “Mathematics are most important, madam!<br>I don’t want to have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and<br>you’ll like it,” and he patted her cheek. “It will drive all the<br>nonsense out of your head.”<br><br>She turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut<br>book from the high desk.<br><br>“Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your Héloïse has<br>sent you. Religious! I don’t interfere with anyone’s belief... I<br>have looked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go.”<br><br>He patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.<br><br>Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that<br>rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer. She<br>sat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and<br>which was littered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as<br>her father was tidy. She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke<br>the seal of her letter. It was from her most intimate friend from<br>childhood; that same Julie Karágina who had been at the Rostóvs’<br>name-day party.<br><br>Julie wrote in French:<br><br>Dear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is<br>separation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness<br>are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance separating us<br>our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart rebels against<br>fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot<br>overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since<br>we parted. Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big<br>study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as<br>three months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle,<br>calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me<br>as I write?<br><br>Having read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror<br>which stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and<br>thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness<br>at her reflection in the glass. “She flatters me,” thought the<br>princess, turning away and continuing to read. But Julie did not flatter<br>her friend, the princess’ eyes—large, deep and luminous (it seemed<br>as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)—were<br>so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face<br>they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty. But the<br>princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes—the look<br>they had when she was not thinking of herself. As with everyone, her<br>face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a<br>glass. She went on reading:<br><br>All Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is already<br>abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march<br>to the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought<br>intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war. God grant<br>that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may<br>be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His<br>goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing of my brothers, this<br>war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart. I mean<br>young Nicholas Rostóv, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain<br>inactive and has left the university to join the army. I will confess to<br>you, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for<br>the army was a great grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you<br>last summer, is so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which<br>one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly,<br>he is so frank and has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that<br>my relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the<br>sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much.<br>Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then.<br>That is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know<br>these poignant joys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are<br>generally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too<br>young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship,<br>this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But enough of<br>this! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of<br>old Count Bezúkhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses<br>have received very little, Prince Vasíli nothing, and it is Monsieur<br>Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been<br>recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bezúkhov and<br>possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince<br>Vasíli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he<br>returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.<br><br>I confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and<br>inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used<br>to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bezúkhov and the<br>owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to<br>watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by<br>marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward<br>him, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort<br>of fellow. As for the past two years people have amused themselves<br>by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don’t even know), the<br>matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess<br>Bezúkhova. But you will understand that I have no desire for the post.<br>À propos of marriages: do you know that a while ago that universal<br>auntie Anna Mikháylovna told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of<br>a plan of marriage for you. It is neither more nor less than with Prince<br>Vasíli’s son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to<br>someone rich and distinguée, and it is on you that his relations’<br>choice has fallen. I don’t know what you will think of it, but<br>I consider it my duty to let you know of it. He is said to be very<br>handsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is all I have been able to find<br>out about him.<br><br>But enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and<br>Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apráksins’. Read the<br>mystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here. Though<br>there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it<br>is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! Give<br>my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne. I embrace you as I love you.<br><br>JULIE<br><br>P.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.<br><br>The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous<br>eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then she suddenly<br>rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She took a sheet of<br>paper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the reply she wrote,<br>also in French:<br><br>Dear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great<br>delight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which<br>you say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect<br>on you. You complain of our separation. What then should I say, if I<br>dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me? Ah, if<br>we had not religion to console us life would be very sad. Why do you<br>suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young<br>man? On such matters I am only severe with myself. I understand such<br>feelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of<br>them, neither do I condemn them. Only it seems to me that Christian<br>love, love of one’s neighbor, love of one’s enemy, is worthier,<br>sweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a<br>young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself.<br><br>The news of Count Bezúkhov’s death reached us before your letter<br>and my father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last<br>representative but one of the great century, and that it is his own<br>turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as<br>possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!<br><br>I cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He always<br>seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value<br>most in people. As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince<br>Vasíli, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend, our divine<br>Saviour’s words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the<br>eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are<br>terribly true. I pity Prince Vasíli but am still more sorry for Pierre.<br>So young, and burdened with such riches—to what temptations he will be<br>exposed! If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be<br>poorer than the poorest beggar. A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the<br>volume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow. Yet since<br>you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our<br>weak human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to<br>spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear<br>no fruit. I never could understand the fondness some people have for<br>confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken<br>their doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for<br>exaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read<br>the Epistles and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries<br>they contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the<br>terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh<br>which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us<br>rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our<br>divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to<br>conform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less<br>we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who<br>rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek<br>to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will<br>He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.<br><br>My father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he<br>has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vasíli. In<br>regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet<br>friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must<br>conform. However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay<br>the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as<br>faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings<br>toward him whom He may give me for husband.<br><br>I have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival<br>at Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief one,<br>however, for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war<br>into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only where you<br>are—at the heart of affairs and of the world—is the talk all of<br>war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature—which townsfolk<br>consider characteristic of the country—rumors of war are heard<br>and painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and<br>countermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day<br>before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a<br>heartrending scene.... It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our<br>people and starting to join the army. You should have seen the state of<br>the mothers, wives, and children of the men who were going and should<br>have heard the sobs. It seems as though mankind has forgotten the<br>laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love and forgiveness of<br>injuries—and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing<br>one another.<br><br>Adieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy<br>Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!<br><br>MARY<br><br>“Ah, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched<br>mine. I have written to my poor mother,” said the smiling Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r’s.<br>She brought into Princess Mary’s strenuous, mournful, and gloomy<br>world a quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and<br>self-satisfied.<br><br>“Princess, I must warn you,” she added, lowering her voice and<br>evidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with<br>exaggerated grasseyement, “the prince has been scolding Michael<br>Ivánovich. He is in a very bad humor, very morose. Be prepared.”<br><br>“Ah, dear friend,” replied Princess Mary, “I have asked you never<br>to warn me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to judge<br>him and would not have others do so.”<br><br>The princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes<br>late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting<br>room with a look of alarm. Between twelve and two o’clock, as the<br>day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the<br>clavichord.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXVI<br><br>The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of<br>the prince, who was in his large study. From the far side of the house<br>through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages—twenty<br>times repeated—of a sonata by Dussek.<br><br>Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the<br>porch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to<br>alight, and let her pass into the house before him. Old Tíkhon, wearing<br>a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in<br>a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door.<br>Tíkhon knew that neither the son’s arrival nor any other unusual<br>event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day. Prince<br>Andrew apparently knew this as well as Tíkhon; he looked at his watch<br>as if to ascertain whether his father’s habits had changed since he<br>was at home last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he<br>turned to his wife.<br><br>“He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Mary’s<br>room,” he said.<br><br>The little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes<br>and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as<br>merrily and prettily as ever.<br><br>“Why, this is a palace!” she said to her husband, looking around<br>with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball.<br>“Let’s come, quick, quick!” And with a glance round, she smiled at<br>Tíkhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.<br><br>“Is that Mary practicing? Let’s go quietly and take her by<br>surprise.”<br><br>Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.<br><br>“You’ve grown older, Tíkhon,” he said in passing to the old man,<br>who kissed his hand.<br><br>Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord<br>came, the pretty, fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne,<br>rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.<br><br>“Ah! what joy for the princess!” exclaimed she: “At last! I must<br>let her know.”<br><br>“No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,” said<br>the little princess, kissing her. “I know you already through my<br>sister-in-law’s friendship for you. She was not expecting us?”<br><br>They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound<br>of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped and<br>made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.<br><br>The little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the<br>middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary’s heavy tread and the<br>sound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who<br>had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in<br>each other’s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they<br>happened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her<br>hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to<br>cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as<br>lovers of music do when they hear a false note. The two women let go<br>of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each<br>other’s hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began<br>kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrew’s surprise<br>both began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to<br>cry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women<br>it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it never<br>entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting.<br><br>“Ah! my dear!... Ah! Mary!...” they suddenly exclaimed, and then<br>laughed. “I dreamed last night...”—“You were not expecting<br>us?...” “Ah! Mary, you have got thinner?...” “And you have grown<br>stouter!...”<br><br>“I knew the princess at once,” put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.<br><br>“And I had no idea!...” exclaimed Princess Mary. “Ah, Andrew, I<br>did not see you.”<br><br>Prince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and<br>he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess Mary had<br>turned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm,<br>gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment,<br>rested on Prince Andrew’s face.<br><br>The little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip<br>continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary<br>and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of<br>glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had<br>had on the Spásski Hill which might have been serious for her in her<br>condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left<br>all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have<br>to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty<br>Odýntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary,<br>a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was<br>still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full<br>of love and sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of<br>thought independent of her sister-in-law’s words. In the midst of a<br>description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother:<br><br>“So you are really going to the war, Andrew?” she said sighing.<br><br>Lise sighed too.<br><br>“Yes, and even tomorrow,” replied her brother.<br><br>“He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had<br>promotion...”<br><br>Princess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of<br>thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure.<br><br>“Is it certain?” she said.<br><br>The face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: “Yes,<br>quite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful...”<br><br>Her lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law’s<br>and unexpectedly again began to cry.<br><br>“She needs rest,” said Prince Andrew with a frown. “Don’t you,<br>Lise? Take her to your room and I’ll go to Father. How is he? Just the<br>same?”<br><br>“Yes, just the same. Though I don’t know what your opinion will<br>be,” answered the princess joyfully.<br><br>“And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the<br>lathe?” asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which<br>showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was<br>aware of his weaknesses.<br><br>“The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and<br>my geometry lessons,” said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons<br>in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.<br><br>When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old<br>prince to get up, Tíkhon came to call the young prince to his father.<br>The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his<br>son’s arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while<br>he dressed for dinner. The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned<br>style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew<br>entered his father’s dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and<br>manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which<br>he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered<br>chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tíkhon.<br><br>“Ah! here’s the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?” said the<br>old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tíkhon<br>was holding fast to plait, would allow.<br><br>“You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like<br>this he’ll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?” And he<br>held out his cheek.<br><br>The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He<br>used to say that a nap “after dinner was silver—before dinner,<br>golden.”) He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his<br>thick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on<br>the spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his father’s favorite<br>topic—making fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly<br>of Bonaparte.<br><br>“Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is<br>pregnant,” said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his<br>father’s face with an eager and respectful look. “How is your<br>health?”<br><br>“Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from<br>morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.”<br><br>“Thank God,” said his son smiling.<br><br>“God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,” he continued,<br>returning to his hobby; “tell me how the Germans have taught you to<br>fight Bonaparte by this new science you call ‘strategy.’”<br><br>Prince Andrew smiled.<br><br>“Give me time to collect my wits, Father,” said he, with a smile<br>that showed that his father’s foibles did not prevent his son from<br>loving and honoring him. “Why, I have not yet had time to settle<br>down!”<br><br>“Nonsense, nonsense!” cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to<br>see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. “The<br>house for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and<br>show her over, and they’ll talk nineteen to the dozen. That’s<br>their woman’s way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About<br>Mikhelson’s army I understand—Tolstóy ‘s too... a simultaneous<br>expedition.... But what’s the southern army to do? Prussia is<br>neutral... I know that. What about Austria?” said he, rising from his<br>chair and pacing up and down the room followed by Tíkhon, who ran after<br>him, handing him different articles of clothing. “What of Sweden? How<br>will they cross Pomerania?”<br><br>Prince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began—at first<br>reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit<br>changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on—to explain<br>the plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an army,<br>ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out<br>of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was<br>to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty<br>thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in<br>Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English<br>were to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand<br>men was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did<br>not evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were<br>not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three<br>times unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: “The<br>white one, the white one!”<br><br>This meant that Tíkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted.<br>Another time he interrupted, saying:<br><br>“And will she soon be confined?” and shaking his head reproachfully<br>said: “That’s bad! Go on, go on.”<br><br>The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his<br>description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age:<br>“Malbrook s’en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra.” *<br><br>     * “Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he’ll<br>     return.”<br><br><br>His son only smiled.<br><br>“I don’t say it’s a plan I approve of,” said the son; “I am<br>only telling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now,<br>not worse than this one.”<br><br>“Well, you’ve told me nothing new,” and the old man repeated,<br>meditatively and rapidly:<br><br>“Dieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXVII<br><br>At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the<br>dining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by<br>a strange caprice of his employer’s was admitted to table though the<br>position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly<br>not have caused him to expect that honor. The prince, who generally kept<br>very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important<br>government officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael<br>Ivánovich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his<br>checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals,<br>and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivánovich<br>was “not a whit worse than you or I.” At dinner the prince usually<br>spoke to the taciturn Michael Ivánovich more often than to anyone else.<br><br>In the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was<br>exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen—one<br>behind each chair—stood waiting for the prince to enter. The head<br>butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making<br>signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door<br>by which the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at a large<br>gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes<br>Bolkónski, opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted<br>portrait (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate)<br>of a ruling prince, in a crown—an alleged descendant of Rúrik and<br>ancestor of the Bolkónskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at that<br>genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at<br>a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.<br><br>“How thoroughly like him that is!” he said to Princess Mary, who had<br>come up to him.<br><br>Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand<br>what he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired her with<br>reverence and was beyond question.<br><br>“Everyone has his Achilles’ heel,” continued Prince Andrew.<br>“Fancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!”<br><br>Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother’s<br>criticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard<br>coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was<br>his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners<br>with the strict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock<br>struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing<br>room. The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under<br>their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on<br>the little princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the<br>sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around<br>him. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of<br>her neck.<br><br>“I’m glad, glad, to see you,” he said, looking attentively into<br>her eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. “Sit down,<br>sit down! Sit down, Michael Ivánovich!”<br><br>He indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman moved<br>the chair for her.<br><br>“Ho, ho!” said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure.<br>“You’ve been in a hurry. That’s bad!”<br><br>He laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only<br>and not with his eyes.<br><br>“You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,” he<br>said.<br><br>The little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She was<br>silent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father, and<br>she began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances, and<br>she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings<br>from various people and retelling the town gossip.<br><br>“Countess Apráksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has<br>cried her eyes out,” she said, growing more and more lively.<br><br>As she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly,<br>and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a<br>definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael Ivánovich.<br><br>“Well, Michael Ivánovich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time<br>of it. Prince Andrew” (he always spoke thus of his son) “has been<br>telling me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I<br>never thought much of him.”<br><br>Michael Ivánovich did not at all know when “you and I” had said<br>such things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as<br>a peg on which to hang the prince’s favorite topic, he looked<br>inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow.<br><br>“He is a great tactician!” said the prince to his son, pointing to<br>the architect.<br><br>And the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the<br>generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced not<br>only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the<br>A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant<br>little Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any<br>Potëmkins or Suvórovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced<br>that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war,<br>but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing,<br>pretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his<br>father’s ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him<br>with evident pleasure.<br><br>“The past always seems good,” said he, “but did not Suvórov<br>himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know<br>how to escape?”<br><br>“Who told you that? Who?” cried the prince. “Suvórov!” And he<br>jerked away his plate, which Tíkhon briskly caught. “Suvórov!...<br>Consider, Prince Andrew. Two... Frederick and Suvórov; Moreau!...<br>Moreau would have been a prisoner if Suvórov had had a free hand; but<br>he had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would have<br>puzzled the devil himself! When you get there you’ll find out what<br>those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suvórov couldn’t manage them so<br>what chance has Michael Kutúzov? No, my dear boy,” he continued,<br>“you and your generals won’t get on against Buonaparte; you’ll<br>have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight<br>together. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to<br>fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,” he said, alluding to the invitation made<br>that year to Moreau to enter the Russian service.... “Wonderful!...<br>Were the Potëmkins, Suvórovs, and Orlóvs Germans? No, lad, either you<br>fellows have all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help<br>you, but we’ll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great<br>commander among them! Hm!...”<br><br>“I don’t at all say that all the plans are good,” said Prince<br>Andrew, “I am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You<br>may laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great<br>general!”<br><br>“Michael Ivánovich!” cried the old prince to the architect who,<br>busy with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: “Didn’t<br>I tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same<br>thing.”<br><br>“To be sure, your excellency,” replied the architect.<br><br>The prince again laughed his frigid laugh.<br><br>“Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got<br>splendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only<br>idlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began everybody<br>has beaten the Germans. They beat no one—except one another. He made<br>his reputation fighting them.”<br><br>And the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to<br>him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His<br>son made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were<br>presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion. He<br>listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this<br>old man, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and<br>discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and<br>political events.<br><br>“You think I’m an old man and don’t understand the present state<br>of affairs?” concluded his father. “But it troubles me. I don’t<br>sleep at night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown<br>his skill?” he concluded.<br><br>“That would take too long to tell,” answered the son.<br><br>“Well, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne,<br>here’s another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,” he<br>exclaimed in excellent French.<br><br>“You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!”<br><br>“Dieu sait quand reviendra.” hummed the prince out of tune and, with<br>a laugh still more so, he quitted the table.<br><br>The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of<br>the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her<br>father-in-law and now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she<br>took her sister-in-law’s arm and drew her into another room.<br><br>“What a clever man your father is,” said she; “perhaps that is why<br>I am afraid of him.”<br><br>“Oh, he is so kind!” answered Princess Mary.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXVIII<br><br>Prince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not altering<br>his routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little princess was in<br>her sister-in-law’s room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without<br>epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him.<br>After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he<br>ordered the horses to be harnessed. Only those things he always kept<br>with him remained in his room; a small box, a large canteen fitted<br>with silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a saber—a present from<br>his father who had brought it from the siege of Ochákov. All these<br>traveling effects of Prince Andrew’s were in very good order: new,<br>clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes.<br><br>When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable<br>of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At such moments<br>one reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrew’s face<br>looked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him he paced<br>briskly from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him<br>and thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear going to the war, or was<br>he sad at leaving his wife?—perhaps both, but evidently he did not<br>wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he<br>hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the<br>cover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable<br>expression. It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.<br><br>“I hear you have given orders to harness,” she cried, panting (she<br>had apparently been running), “and I did so wish to have another talk<br>with you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You are not<br>angry with me for coming? You have changed so, Andrúsha,” she added,<br>as if to explain such a question.<br><br>She smiled as she uttered his pet name, “Andrúsha.” It was<br>obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be<br>Andrúsha—the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in<br>childhood.<br><br>“And where is Lise?” he asked, answering her question only by a<br>smile.<br><br>“She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room.<br>Oh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,” said she, sitting<br>down on the sofa, facing her brother. “She is quite a child: such a<br>dear, merry child. I have grown so fond of her.”<br><br>Prince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and<br>contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.<br><br>“One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them,<br>Andrew? Don’t forget that she has grown up and been educated in<br>society, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into<br>everyone’s situation. Tout comprendre, c’est tout pardonner. * Think<br>what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to,<br>to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her<br>condition! It’s very hard.”<br><br>     * To understand all is to forgive all.<br><br>Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we<br>think we thoroughly understand.<br><br>“You live in the country and don’t think the life terrible,” he<br>replied.<br><br>“I... that’s different. Why speak of me? I don’t want any other<br>life, and can’t, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young<br>society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her<br>life, all alone—for Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what<br>poor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society.<br>There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....”<br><br>“I don’t like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,” said Prince<br>Andrew.<br><br>“No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she’s much to be<br>pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don’t need her,<br>and she’s even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am<br>even more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and<br>Michael Ivánovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and<br>kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says:<br>‘We don’t love people so much for the good they have done us, as<br>for the good we have done them.’ Father took her when she was homeless<br>after losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father<br>likes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads<br>splendidly.”<br><br>“To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father’s character sometimes<br>makes things trying for you, doesn’t it?” Prince Andrew asked<br>suddenly.<br><br>Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.<br><br>“For me? For me?... Trying for me!...” said she.<br><br>“He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he’s getting<br>very trying,” said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their<br>father in order to puzzle or test his sister.<br><br>“You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of<br>intellectual pride,” said the princess, following the train of her own<br>thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation—“and that’s a<br>great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling<br>except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so<br>contented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I<br>am.”<br><br>Her brother shook his head incredulously.<br><br>“The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth,<br>Andrew... is Father’s way of treating religious subjects. I don’t<br>understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is<br>as clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing<br>that makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of<br>improvement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a<br>monk he received and had a long talk with.”<br><br>“Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your<br>powder,” said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.<br><br>“Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me.<br>Andrew...” she said timidly after a moment’s silence, “I have a<br>great favor to ask of you.”<br><br>“What is it, dear?”<br><br>“No—promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble<br>and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise,<br>Andrúsha!...” said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet<br>taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were<br>the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was<br>granted.<br><br>She looked timidly at her brother.<br><br>“Even if it were a great deal of trouble...” answered Prince Andrew,<br>as if guessing what it was about.<br><br>“Think what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as<br>you please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father’s father, our<br>grandfather, wore it in all his wars.” (She still did not take out<br>what she was holding in her reticule.) “So you promise?”<br><br>“Of course. What is it?”<br><br>“Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will<br>never take it off. Do you promise?”<br><br>“If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won’t break my neck...<br>To please you...” said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing<br>the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister’s face, he<br>repented and added: “I am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.”<br><br>“Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you<br>to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,” said she in a voice<br>trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her<br>brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold<br>setting, on a finely wrought silver chain.<br><br>She crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.<br><br>“Please, Andrew, for my sake!...”<br><br>Rays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit<br>up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother<br>would have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew understood,<br>crossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of tenderness, for<br>he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.<br><br>“Thank you, my dear.” She kissed him on the forehead and sat down<br>again on the sofa. They were silent for a while.<br><br>“As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always<br>used to be. Don’t judge Lise harshly,” she began. “She is so<br>sweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.”<br><br>“I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, Másha, or blamed<br>her. Why do you say all this to me?”<br><br>Red patches appeared on Princess Mary’s face and she was silent as if<br>she felt guilty.<br><br>“I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. And<br>I am sorry for that,” he went on.<br><br>The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried to<br>say something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the little<br>princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings<br>about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her<br>fate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After crying she had fallen<br>asleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.<br><br>“Know this, Másha: I can’t reproach, have not reproached, and never<br>shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach myself<br>with anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever<br>circumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if<br>you want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this<br>is so I don’t know...”<br><br>As he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed<br>her forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and<br>unaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over<br>her head toward the darkness of the open doorway.<br><br>“Let us go to her, I must say good-by. Or—go and wake and I’ll<br>come in a moment. Petrúshka!” he called to his valet: “Come here,<br>take these away. Put this on the seat and this to the right.”<br><br>Princess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said:<br>“Andrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him<br>to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been<br>answered.”<br><br>“Well, maybe!” said Prince Andrew. “Go, Másha; I’ll come<br>immediately.”<br><br>On the way to his sister’s room, in the passage which connected one<br>wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling<br>sweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and<br>artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.<br><br>“Oh! I thought you were in your room,” she said, for some reason<br>blushing and dropping her eyes.<br><br>Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly<br>came over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead<br>and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the<br>Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he reached his<br>sister’s room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying<br>one word after another, came through the open door. She was speaking as<br>usual in French, and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make<br>up for lost time.<br><br>“No, but imagine the old Countess Zúbova, with false curls and her<br>mouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age....<br>Ha, ha, ha! Mary!”<br><br>This very sentence about Countess Zúbova and this same laugh Prince<br>Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some<br>five times. He entered the room softly. The little princess, plump and<br>rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking<br>incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases. Prince<br>Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after<br>their journey. She answered him and continued her chatter.<br><br>The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn<br>night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.<br>Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense<br>house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The<br>domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to<br>the young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the<br>reception hall: Michael Ivánovich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess<br>Mary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his<br>father’s study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone. All<br>were waiting for them to come out.<br><br>When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age<br>spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his<br>son, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.<br><br>“Going?” And he went on writing.<br><br>“I’ve come to say good-by.”<br><br>“Kiss me here,” and he touched his cheek: “Thanks, thanks!”<br><br>“What do you thank me for?”<br><br>“For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman’s apron strings.<br>The Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!” And he went on<br>writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. “If you have<br>anything to say, say it. These two things can be done together,” he<br>added.<br><br>“About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your<br>hands....”<br><br>“Why talk nonsense? Say what you want.”<br><br>“When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... Let<br>him be here....”<br><br>The old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his<br>stern eyes on his son.<br><br>“I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,” said<br>Prince Andrew, evidently confused. “I know that out of a million<br>cases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been<br>telling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened.”<br><br>“Hm... Hm...” muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he<br>was writing. “I’ll do it.”<br><br>He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to<br>laugh.<br><br>“It’s a bad business, eh?”<br><br>“What is bad, Father?”<br><br>“The wife!” said the old prince, briefly and significantly.<br><br>“I don’t understand!” said Prince Andrew.<br><br>“No, it can’t be helped, lad,” said the prince. “They’re<br>all like that; one can’t unmarry. Don’t be afraid; I won’t tell<br>anyone, but you know it yourself.”<br><br>He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked<br>straight into his son’s face with keen eyes which seemed to see<br>through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.<br><br>The son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him. The<br>old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing<br>down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity.<br><br>“What’s to be done? She’s pretty! I will do everything. Make your<br>mind easy,” said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.<br><br>Andrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father<br>understood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his son.<br><br>“Listen!” said he; “don’t worry about your wife: what can be<br>done shall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilariónovich. *<br>I have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not<br>keep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember<br>and like him. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all<br>right—serve him. Nicholas Bolkónski’s son need not serve under<br>anyone if he is in disfavor. Now come here.”<br><br>     *Kutúzov.<br><br>He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son<br>was accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised the<br>lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his<br>bold, tall, close handwriting.<br><br>“I shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs;<br>hand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond<br>and a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of<br>Suvórov’s wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for<br>you to read when I am gone. You will find them useful.”<br><br>Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time<br>yet. He felt that he must not say it.<br><br>“I will do it all, Father,” he said.<br><br>“Well, now, good-by!” He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced<br>him. “Remember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me,<br>your old father...” he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous<br>voice suddenly shrieked: “but if I hear that you have not behaved like<br>a son of Nicholas Bolkónski, I shall be ashamed!”<br><br>“You need not have said that to me, Father,” said the son with a<br>smile.<br><br>The old man was silent.<br><br>“I also wanted to ask you,” continued Prince Andrew, “if I’m<br>killed and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you—as I<br>said yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please.”<br><br>“Not let the wife have him?” said the old man, and laughed.<br><br>They stood silent, facing one another. The old man’s sharp eyes were<br>fixed straight on his son’s. Something twitched in the lower part of<br>the old prince’s face.<br><br>“We’ve said good-by. Go!” he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry<br>voice, opening his door.<br><br>“What is it? What?” asked both princesses when they saw for a moment<br>at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white<br>dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.<br><br>Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply.<br><br>“Well!” he said, turning to his wife.<br><br>And this “Well!” sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying: “Now<br>go through your performance.”<br><br>“Andrew, already!” said the little princess, turning pale and<br>looking with dismay at her husband.<br><br>He embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.<br><br>He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face,<br>and carefully placed her in an easy chair.<br><br>“Adieu, Mary,” said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand<br>and kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.<br><br>The little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing<br>her temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked<br>with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince<br>Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction. From<br>the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man<br>angrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study<br>door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white<br>dressing gown looked out.<br><br>“Gone? That’s all right!” said he; and looking angrily at the<br>unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed<br>the door.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK TWO: 1805<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of<br>the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly arriving from<br>Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the<br>inhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau was the headquarters of<br>the commander in chief, Kutúzov.<br><br>On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached<br>Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected<br>by the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance of the<br>locality and surroundings—fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs,<br>and hills in the distance—and despite the fact that the inhabitants<br>(who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the<br>regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for<br>an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.<br><br>On the evening of the last day’s march an order had been received that<br>the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though<br>the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and<br>the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or<br>not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders<br>to present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is<br>always better to “bow too low than not bow low enough.” So the<br>soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all<br>night long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and<br>company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by morning the<br>regiment—instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on<br>its last march the day before—presented a well-ordered array of two<br>thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had every button<br>and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness. And not only<br>externally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief<br>to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean<br>shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles, “awl,<br>soap, and all,” as the soldiers say. There was only one circumstance<br>concerning which no one could be at ease. It was the state of the<br>soldiers’ boots. More than half the men’s boots were in holes. But<br>this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for<br>in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian<br>commissariat, and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles.<br><br>The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and<br>thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from<br>chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new uniform<br>showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes<br>which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders. He<br>had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of<br>his life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled<br>himself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander<br>admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was<br>engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military<br>matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his<br>thoughts.<br><br>“Well, Michael Mítrich, sir?” he said, addressing one of the<br>battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that<br>they both felt happy). “We had our hands full last night. However, I<br>think the regiment is not a bad one, eh?”<br><br>The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.<br><br>“It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsarítsin<br>Meadow.”<br><br>“What?” asked the commander.<br><br>At that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had been<br>posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an aide-de-camp<br>followed by a Cossack.<br><br>The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been<br>clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief<br>wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on<br>the march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation<br>whatever.<br><br>A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutúzov the day<br>before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of<br>the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutúzov, not considering this<br>junction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of his view,<br>to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops<br>arrived from Russia. With this object he intended to meet the regiment;<br>so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander<br>in chief would be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know these<br>circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the<br>men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the<br>commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On hearing this the<br>regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and<br>spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.<br><br>“A fine mess we’ve made of it!” he remarked.<br><br>“There now! Didn’t I tell you, Michael Mítrich, that if it was said<br>‘on the march’ it meant in greatcoats?” said he reproachfully to<br>the battalion commander. “Oh, my God!” he added, stepping resolutely<br>forward. “Company commanders!” he shouted in a voice accustomed to<br>command. “Sergeants major!... How soon will he be here?” he asked<br>the aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the<br>personage he was referring to.<br><br>“In an hour’s time, I should say.”<br><br>“Shall we have time to change clothes?”<br><br>“I don’t know, General....”<br><br>The regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the<br>soldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders ran off<br>to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats<br>were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares that had up<br>to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and<br>hum with voices. On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing<br>up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps<br>over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on<br>with upraised arms.<br><br>In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray<br>instead of black. The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps<br>to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance.<br><br>“Whatever is this? This!” he shouted and stood still. “Commander<br>of the third company!”<br><br>“Commander of the third company wanted by the general!... commander to<br>the general... third company to the commander.” The words passed along<br>the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer.<br><br>When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in<br>a cry of: “The general to the third company,” the missing officer<br>appeared from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged man<br>and not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on his<br>toes toward the general. The captain’s face showed the uneasiness of<br>a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned. Spots<br>appeared on his nose, the redness of which was evidently due to<br>intemperance, and his mouth twitched nervously. The general looked the<br>captain up and down as he came up panting, slackening his pace as he<br>approached.<br><br>“You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?”<br>shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing<br>at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish<br>cloth, which contrasted with the others. “What have you been after?<br>The commander in chief is expected and you leave your place? Eh? I’ll<br>teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade.... Eh...?”<br><br>The commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior,<br>pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this<br>pressure lay his only hope of salvation.<br><br>“Well, why don’t you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as a<br>Hungarian?” said the commander with an austere gibe.<br><br>“Your excellency...”<br><br>“Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your<br>excellency?... nobody knows.”<br><br>“Your excellency, it’s the officer Dólokhov, who has been reduced<br>to the ranks,” said the captain softly.<br><br>“Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier?<br>If a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the<br>others.”<br><br>“Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.”<br><br>“Gave him leave? Leave? That’s just like you young men,” said the<br>regimental commander cooling down a little. “Leave indeed.... One says<br>a word to you and you... What?” he added with renewed irritation, “I<br>beg you to dress your men decently.”<br><br>And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky<br>steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his own display of<br>anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for<br>wrath. Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another<br>because his line was not straight, he reached the third company.<br><br>“H-o-o-w are you standing? Where’s your leg? Your leg?” shouted<br>the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there were<br>still five men between him and Dólokhov with his bluish-gray uniform.<br><br>Dólokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with his<br>clear, insolent eyes in the general’s face.<br><br>“Why a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his coat...<br>the ras...” he did not finish.<br><br>“General, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...”<br>Dólokhov hurriedly interrupted.<br><br>“No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!”<br><br>“Not bound to endure insults,” Dólokhov concluded in loud, ringing<br>tones.<br><br>The eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general became silent,<br>angrily pulling down his tight scarf.<br><br>“I request you to have the goodness to change your coat,” he said as<br>he turned away.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>“He’s coming!” shouted the signaler at that moment.<br><br>The regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup<br>with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself,<br>drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening<br>his mouth awry, prepared to shout. The regiment fluttered like a bird<br>preening its plumage and became motionless.<br><br>“Att-ention!” shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking<br>voice which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and<br>welcome for the approaching chief.<br><br>Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high,<br>light blue Viennese calèche, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn<br>by six horses at a smart trot. Behind the calèche galloped the suite<br>and a convoy of Croats. Beside Kutúzov sat an Austrian general, in<br>a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones. The<br>calèche stopped in front of the regiment. Kutúzov and the Austrian<br>general were talking in low voices and Kutúzov smiled slightly as<br>treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two<br>thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did<br>not exist.<br><br>The word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as with a<br>jingling sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence the<br>feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard. The regiment roared,<br>“Health to your ex... len... len... lency!” and again all became<br>silent. At first Kutúzov stood still while the regiment moved; then he<br>and the general in white, accompanied by the suite, walked between the<br>ranks.<br><br>From the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and<br>devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and from<br>the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward<br>and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way he<br>darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief,<br>it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even<br>greater zeal than his duty as a commander. Thanks to the strictness and<br>assiduity of its commander the regiment, in comparison with others that<br>had reached Braunau at the same time, was in splendid condition. There<br>were only 217 sick and stragglers. Everything was in good order except<br>the boots.<br><br>Kutúzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few<br>friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes<br>also to the soldiers. Looking at their boots he several times shook his<br>head sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression<br>which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help<br>noticing what a bad state of things it was. The regimental commander<br>ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of the<br>commander in chief’s regarding the regiment. Behind Kutúzov, at a<br>distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard, followed<br>some twenty men of his suite. These gentlemen talked among themselves<br>and sometimes laughed. Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked<br>a handsome adjutant. This was Prince Bolkónski. Beside him was his<br>comrade Nesvítski, a tall staff officer, extremely stout, with a<br>kindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes. Nesvítski could hardly<br>keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked<br>beside him. This hussar, with a grave face and without a smile or a<br>change in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the regimental<br>commander’s back and mimicked his every movement. Each time the<br>commander started and bent forward, the hussar started and bent forward<br>in exactly the same manner. Nesvítski laughed and nudged the others to<br>make them look at the wag.<br><br>Kutúzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were<br>starting from their sockets to watch their chief. On reaching the<br>third company he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected this,<br>involuntarily came closer to him.<br><br>“Ah, Timókhin!” said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had<br>been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.<br><br>One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself<br>more than Timókhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental<br>commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew<br>himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained<br>it had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so Kutúzov,<br>who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good,<br>quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his<br>scarred and puffy face.<br><br>“Another Ismail comrade,” said he. “A brave officer! Are you<br>satisfied with him?” he asked the regimental commander.<br><br>And the latter—unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar<br>officer as in a looking glass—started, moved forward, and answered:<br>“Highly satisfied, your excellency!”<br><br>“We all have our weaknesses,” said Kutúzov smiling and walking away<br>from him. “He used to have a predilection for Bacchus.”<br><br>The regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did<br>not answer. The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed<br>captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose<br>with such exactitude that Nesvítski could not help laughing. Kutúzov<br>turned round. The officer evidently had complete control of his face,<br>and while Kutúzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume<br>a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.<br><br>The third company was the last, and Kutúzov pondered, apparently trying<br>to recollect something. Prince Andrew stepped forward from among the<br>suite and said in French:<br><br>“You told me to remind you of the officer Dólokhov, reduced to the<br>ranks in this regiment.”<br><br>“Where is Dólokhov?” asked Kutúzov.<br><br>Dólokhov, who had already changed into a soldier’s gray greatcoat,<br>did not wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-haired<br>soldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went<br>up to the commander in chief, and presented arms.<br><br>“Have you a complaint to make?” Kutúzov asked with a slight frown.<br><br>“This is Dólokhov,” said Prince Andrew.<br><br>“Ah!” said Kutúzov. “I hope this will be a lesson to you. Do your<br>duty. The Emperor is gracious, and I shan’t forget you if you deserve<br>well.”<br><br>The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as<br>they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression<br>to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief<br>so widely from a private.<br><br>“One thing I ask of your excellency,” Dólokhov said in his firm,<br>ringing, deliberate voice. “I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault<br>and prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!”<br><br>Kutúzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes with which he had<br>turned from Captain Timókhin again flitted over his face. He turned<br>away with a grimace as if to say that everything Dólokhov had said to<br>him and everything he could say had long been known to him, that he was<br>weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted. He turned away and<br>went to the carriage.<br><br>The regiment broke up into companies, which went to their appointed<br>quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and<br>to rest after their hard marches.<br><br>“You won’t bear me a grudge, Prokhór Ignátych?” said the<br>regimental commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its<br>quarters and riding up to Captain Timókhin who was walking in front.<br>(The regimental commander’s face now that the inspection was happily<br>over beamed with irrepressible delight.) “It’s in the Emperor’s<br>service... it can’t be helped... one is sometimes a bit hasty on<br>parade... I am the first to apologize, you know me!... He was very<br>pleased!” And he held out his hand to the captain.<br><br>“Don’t mention it, General, as if I’d be so bold!” replied the<br>captain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where<br>two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end<br>of a gun at Ismail.<br><br>“And tell Mr. Dólokhov that I won’t forget him—he may be quite<br>easy. And tell me, please—I’ve been meaning to ask—how is he<br>behaving himself, and in general...”<br><br>“As far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency;<br>but his character...” said Timókhin.<br><br>“And what about his character?” asked the regimental commander.<br><br>“It’s different on different days,” answered the captain. “One<br>day he is sensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next he’s<br>a wild beast.... In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew.”<br><br>“Oh, well, well!” remarked the regimental commander. “Still, one<br>must have pity on a young man in misfortune. You know he has important<br>connections... Well, then, you just...”<br><br>“I will, your excellency,” said Timókhin, showing by his smile that<br>he understood his commander’s wish.<br><br>“Well, of course, of course!”<br><br>The regimental commander sought out Dólokhov in the ranks and, reining<br>in his horse, said to him:<br><br>“After the next affair... epaulettes.”<br><br>Dólokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the mocking<br>smile on his lips change.<br><br>“Well, that’s all right,” continued the regimental commander. “A<br>cup of vodka for the men from me,” he added so that the soldiers<br>could hear. “I thank you all! God be praised!” and he rode past that<br>company and overtook the next one.<br><br>“Well, he’s really a good fellow, one can serve under him,” said<br>Timókhin to the subaltern beside him.<br><br>“In a word, a hearty one...” said the subaltern, laughing (the<br>regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts).<br><br>The cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the<br>soldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiers’ voices could be<br>heard on every side.<br><br>“And they said Kutúzov was blind of one eye?”<br><br>“And so he is! Quite blind!”<br><br>“No, friend, he is sharper-eyed than you are. Boots and leg bands...<br>he noticed everything...”<br><br>“When he looked at my feet, friend... well, thinks I...”<br><br>“And that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were<br>smeared with chalk—as white as flour! I suppose they polish him up as<br>they do the guns.”<br><br>“I say, Fédeshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You<br>were near him. Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau.”<br><br>“Buonaparte himself!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesn’t<br>know! The Prussians are up in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are<br>putting them down. When they’ve been put down, the war with Buonaparte<br>will begin. And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows you’re a fool.<br>You’d better listen more carefully!”<br><br>“What devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is<br>turning into the village already... they will have their buckwheat<br>cooked before we reach our quarters.”<br><br>“Give me a biscuit, you devil!”<br><br>“And did you give me tobacco yesterday? That’s just it, friend! Ah,<br>well, never mind, here you are.”<br><br>“They might call a halt here or we’ll have to do another four miles<br>without eating.”<br><br>“Wasn’t it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still<br>and are drawn along.”<br><br>“And here, friend, the people are quite beggarly. There they all<br>seemed to be Poles—all under the Russian crown—but here they’re<br>all regular Germans.”<br><br>“Singers to the front” came the captain’s order.<br><br>And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front. A<br>drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing<br>his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers’ song, commencing with the<br>words: “Morning dawned, the sun was rising,” and concluding: “On<br>then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father Kámenski.” This song had<br>been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria, the<br>only change being that the words “Father Kámenski” were replaced by<br>“Father Kutúzov.”<br><br>Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms<br>as if flinging something to the ground, the drummer—a lean, handsome<br>soldier of forty—looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his<br>eyes. Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him,<br>he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious<br>object above his head and, holding it there for some seconds, suddenly<br>flung it down and began:<br><br>“Oh, my bower, oh, my bower...!”<br><br>“Oh, my bower new...!” chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet<br>player, in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front<br>and, walking backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and<br>flourished his castanets as if threatening someone. The soldiers,<br>swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously, marched with long<br>steps. Behind the company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs,<br>and the tramp of horses’ hoofs were heard. Kutúzov and his suite were<br>returning to the town. The commander in chief made a sign that the<br>men should continue to march at ease, and he and all his suite showed<br>pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing<br>soldier and the gay and smartly marching men. In the second file<br>from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company,<br>a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice. It was Dólokhov<br>marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and<br>looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that<br>moment marching with the company. The hussar cornet of Kutúzov’s<br>suite who had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from the<br>carriage and rode up to Dólokhov.<br><br>Hussar cornet Zherkóv had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to<br>the wild set led by Dólokhov. Zherkóv had met Dólokhov abroad as a<br>private and had not seen fit to recognize him. But now that Kutúzov had<br>spoken to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the cordiality of<br>an old friend.<br><br>“My dear fellow, how are you?” said he through the singing, making<br>his horse keep pace with the company.<br><br>“How am I?” Dólokhov answered coldly. “I am as you see.”<br><br>The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy<br>gaiety with which Zherkóv spoke, and to the intentional coldness of<br>Dólokhov’s reply.<br><br>“And how do you get on with the officers?” inquired Zherkóv.<br><br>“All right. They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled onto the<br>staff?”<br><br>“I was attached; I’m on duty.”<br><br>Both were silent.<br><br>“She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve,” went the<br>song, arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness.<br>Their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect<br>of that song.<br><br>“Is it true that Austrians have been beaten?” asked Dólokhov.<br><br>“The devil only knows! They say so.”<br><br>“I’m glad,” answered Dólokhov briefly and clearly, as the song<br>demanded.<br><br>“I say, come round some evening and we’ll have a game of faro!”<br>said Zherkóv.<br><br>“Why, have you too much money?”<br><br>“Do come.”<br><br>“I can’t. I’ve sworn not to. I won’t drink and won’t play till<br>I get reinstated.”<br><br>“Well, that’s only till the first engagement.”<br><br>“We shall see.”<br><br>They were again silent.<br><br>“Come if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the<br>staff...”<br><br>Dólokhov smiled. “Don’t trouble. If I want anything, I won’t<br>beg—I’ll take it!”<br><br>“Well, never mind; I only...”<br><br>“And I only...”<br><br>“Good-by.”<br><br>“Good health...”<br><br>        “It’s a long, long way.<br>        To my native land...”<br><br><br>Zherkóv touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly from<br>foot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down, galloped<br>past the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping time to the<br>song.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>On returning from the review, Kutúzov took the Austrian general into<br>his private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers<br>relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival, and the<br>letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in command of<br>the advanced army. Prince Andrew Bolkónski came into the room with the<br>required papers. Kutúzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath<br>were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out.<br><br>“Ah!...” said Kutúzov glancing at Bolkónski as if by this<br>exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the<br>conversation in French.<br><br>“All I can say, General,” said he with a pleasant elegance<br>of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each<br>deliberately spoken word. It was evident that Kutúzov himself listened<br>with pleasure to his own voice. “All I can say, General, is that if<br>the matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the<br>Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago. I should long<br>ago have joined the archduke. And believe me on my honour that to me<br>personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command<br>of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful<br>general—of whom Austria has so many—and to lay down all this heavy<br>responsibility. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us,<br>General.”<br><br>And Kutúzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, “You are quite at<br>liberty not to believe me and I don’t even care whether you do or<br>not, but you have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole<br>point.”<br><br>The Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply<br>in the same tone.<br><br>“On the contrary,” he said, in a querulous and angry tone that<br>contrasted with his flattering words, “on the contrary, your<br>excellency’s participation in the common action is highly valued by<br>His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid<br>Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been<br>accustomed to win in their battles,” he concluded his evidently<br>prearranged sentence.<br><br>Kutúzov bowed with the same smile.<br><br>“But that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which<br>His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the<br>Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General<br>Mack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need<br>our aid,” said Kutúzov.<br><br>The general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an Austrian<br>defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors<br>that were afloat, and so Kutúzov’s suggestion of an Austrian victory<br>sounded much like irony. But Kutúzov went on blandly smiling with the<br>same expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose<br>so. And, in fact, the last letter he had received from Mack’s army<br>informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the<br>army was very favorable.<br><br>“Give me that letter,” said Kutúzov turning to Prince Andrew.<br>“Please have a look at it”—and Kutúzov with an ironical smile<br>about the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the<br>following passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinand’s letter:<br><br>We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with<br>which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech. Also,<br>as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of<br>commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not<br>cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line<br>of communications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his<br>intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful<br>ally. We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial<br>Russian army will be fully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with<br>it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves.<br><br>Kutúzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the<br>member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.<br><br>“But you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect<br>the worst,” said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have done<br>with jests and to come to business. He involuntarily looked round at the<br>aide-de-camp.<br><br>“Excuse me, General,” interrupted Kutúzov, also turning to Prince<br>Andrew. “Look here, my dear fellow, get from Kozlóvski all the<br>reports from our scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and<br>here is one from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are<br>these,” he said, handing him several papers, “make a neat memorandum<br>in French out of all this, showing all the news we have had of the<br>movements of the Austrian army, and then give it to his excellency.”<br><br>Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the<br>first not only what had been said but also what Kutúzov would have<br>liked to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both,<br>stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room.<br><br>Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he<br>had changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his face,<br>in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his former<br>affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man who has time<br>to think of the impression he makes on others, but is occupied with<br>agreeable and interesting work. His face expressed more satisfaction<br>with himself and those around him, his smile and glance were brighter<br>and more attractive.<br><br>Kutúzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very kindly,<br>promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the other adjutants,<br>and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions.<br>From Vienna Kutúzov wrote to his old comrade, Prince Andrew’s father.<br><br>Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry,<br>firmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to have such a<br>subordinate by me.<br><br>On Kutúzov’s staff, among his fellow officers and in the army<br>generally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two<br>quite opposite reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be<br>different from themselves and from everyone else, expected great things<br>of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince<br>Andrew was natural and pleasant. Others, the majority, disliked him and<br>considered him conceited, cold, and disagreeable. But among these people<br>Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even<br>feared him.<br><br>Coming out of Kutúzov’s room into the waiting room with the papers in<br>his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp on duty,<br>Kozlóvski, who was sitting at the window with a book.<br><br>“Well, Prince?” asked Kozlóvski.<br><br>“I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not<br>advancing.”<br><br>“And why is it?”<br><br>Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.<br><br>“Any news from Mack?”<br><br>“No.”<br><br>“If it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come.”<br><br>“Probably,” said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.<br><br>But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the<br>order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head,<br>who had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door.<br>Prince Andrew stopped short.<br><br>“Commander in Chief Kutúzov?” said the newly arrived general<br>speaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and<br>advancing straight toward the inner door.<br><br>“The commander in chief is engaged,” said Kozlóvski, going<br>hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door.<br>“Whom shall I announce?”<br><br>The unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlóvski, who was<br>rather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him.<br><br>“The commander in chief is engaged,” repeated Kozlóvski calmly.<br><br>The general’s face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He took<br>out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the<br>leaf, gave it to Kozlóvski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw<br>himself into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, “Why<br>do they look at me?” Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as<br>if he intended to say something, but immediately, with affected<br>indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer sound which<br>immediately broke off. The door of the private room opened and Kutúzov<br>appeared in the doorway. The general with the bandaged head bent forward<br>as though running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides<br>with his thin legs, went up to Kutúzov.<br><br>“Vous voyez le malheureux Mack,” he uttered in a broken voice.<br><br>Kutúzov’s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly<br>immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave<br>and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully,<br>closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed<br>the door himself behind him.<br><br>The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten<br>and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct.<br>Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with<br>orders which showed that the Russian troops, who had hitherto been<br>inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.<br><br>Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest<br>lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack and heard the<br>details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost,<br>understood all the difficulties of the Russian army’s position, and<br>vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to<br>play. Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the<br>humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a week’s time he might,<br>perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the<br>French since Suvórov met them. He feared that Bonaparte’s genius<br>might outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops, and at the same<br>time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced.<br><br>Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his<br>room to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the corridor<br>he met Nesvítski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag Zherkóv;<br>they were as usual laughing.<br><br>“Why are you so glum?” asked Nesvítski noticing Prince Andrew’s<br>pale face and glittering eyes.<br><br>“There’s nothing to be gay about,” answered Bolkónski.<br><br>Just as Prince Andrew met Nesvítski and Zherkóv, there came toward<br>them from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general<br>who on Kutúzov’s staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian<br>army, and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous<br>evening. There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to<br>pass the three officers quite easily, but Zherkóv, pushing Nesvítski<br>aside with his arm, said in a breathless voice,<br><br>“They’re coming!... they’re coming!... Stand aside, make way,<br>please make way!”<br><br>The generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid<br>embarrassing attentions. On the face of the wag Zherkóv there suddenly<br>appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.<br><br>“Your excellency,” said he in German, stepping forward and<br>addressing the Austrian general, “I have the honor to congratulate<br>you.”<br><br>He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the<br>other, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.<br><br>The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing the<br>seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a moment’s<br>attention. He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.<br><br>“I have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived, quite<br>well, only a little bruised just here,” he added, pointing with a<br>beaming smile to his head.<br><br>The general frowned, turned away, and went on.<br><br>“Gott, wie naiv!” * said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.<br><br>     * “Good God, what simplicity!”<br><br><br>Nesvítski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but<br>Bolkónski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and<br>turned to Zherkóv. The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance<br>of Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the<br>Russian army found vent in anger at Zherkóv’s untimely jest.<br><br>“If you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself,” he said<br>sharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, “I can’t prevent<br>your doing so; but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my<br>presence, I will teach you to behave yourself.”<br><br>Nesvítski and Zherkóv were so surprised by this outburst that they<br>gazed at Bolkónski silently with wide-open eyes.<br><br>“What’s the matter? I only congratulated them,” said Zherkóv.<br><br>“I am not jesting with you; please be silent!” cried Bolkónski,<br>and taking Nesvítski’s arm he left Zherkóv, who did not know what to<br>say.<br><br>“Come, what’s the matter, old fellow?” said Nesvítski trying to<br>soothe him.<br><br>“What’s the matter?” exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in<br>his excitement. “Don’t you understand that either we are officers<br>serving our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and<br>grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely<br>lackeys who care nothing for their master’s business. Quarante mille<br>hommes massacrés et l’armée de nos alliés détruite, et vous<br>trouvez là le mot pour rire,” * he said, as if strengthening his<br>views by this French sentence. “C’est bien pour un garçon de rien<br>comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami, mais pas pour vous, pas<br>pour vous. *(2) Only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this<br>way,” he added in Russian—but pronouncing the word with a French<br>accent—having noticed that Zherkóv could still hear him.<br><br>     * “Forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies<br>     destroyed, and you find that a cause for jesting!”<br><br>     * (2) “It is all very well for that good-for-nothing fellow<br>     of whom you have made a friend, but not for you, not for<br>     you.”<br><br><br>He waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned<br>and went out of the corridor.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>The Pávlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau. The<br>squadron in which Nicholas Rostóv served as a cadet was quartered in<br>the German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village were<br>assigned to cavalry-captain Denísov, the squadron commander, known<br>throughout the whole cavalry division as Váska Denísov. Cadet Rostóv,<br>ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland, had lived with the<br>squadron commander.<br><br>On October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news<br>of Mack’s defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron was<br>proceeding as usual. Denísov, who had been losing at cards all night,<br>had not yet come home when Rostóv rode back early in the morning from<br>a foraging expedition. Rostóv in his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his<br>horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg over the saddle with a supple<br>youthful movement, stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to<br>part from his horse, and at last sprang down and called to his orderly.<br><br>“Ah, Bondarénko, dear friend!” said he to the hussar who rushed up<br>headlong to the horse. “Walk him up and down, my dear fellow,” he<br>continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young<br>people show to everyone when they are happy.<br><br>“Yes, your excellency,” answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his<br>head.<br><br>“Mind, walk him up and down well!”<br><br>Another hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarénko had already<br>thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse’s head. It was<br>evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to<br>serve him. Rostóv patted the horse’s neck and then his flank, and<br>lingered for a moment.<br><br>“Splendid! What a horse he will be!” he thought with a smile, and<br>holding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the<br>porch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork in<br>hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his face<br>immediately brightened on seeing Rostóv. “Schön gut Morgen! Schön<br>gut Morgen!” * he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased<br>to greet the young man.<br><br>    * “A very good morning! A very good morning!”<br><br><br>“Schon fleissig?” * said Rostóv with the same gay brotherly smile<br>which did not leave his eager face. “Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen!<br>Kaiser Alexander hoch!” *(2) said he, quoting words often repeated by<br>the German landlord.<br><br>    * “Busy already?”<br><br>    * (2) “Hurrah for the Austrians! Hurrah for the Russians!<br>     Hurrah for Emperor Alexander!”<br><br><br>The German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and<br>waving it above his head cried:<br><br>“Und die ganze Welt hoch!” *<br><br>    * “And hurrah for the whole world!”<br><br><br>Rostóv waved his cap above his head like the German and cried laughing,<br>“Und vivat die ganze Welt!” Though neither the German cleaning his<br>cowshed nor Rostóv back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any<br>reason for rejoicing, they looked at each other with joyful delight and<br>brotherly love, wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection,<br>and parted smiling, the German returning to his cowshed and Rostóv<br>going to the cottage he occupied with Denísov.<br><br>“What about your master?” he asked Lavrúshka, Denísov’s orderly,<br>whom all the regiment knew for a rogue.<br><br>“Hasn’t been in since the evening. Must have been losing,”<br>answered Lavrúshka. “I know by now, if he wins he comes back early to<br>brag about it, but if he stays out till morning it means he’s lost and<br>will come back in a rage. Will you have coffee?”<br><br>“Yes, bring some.”<br><br>Ten minutes later Lavrúshka brought the coffee. “He’s coming!”<br>said he. “Now for trouble!” Rostóv looked out of the window and<br>saw Denísov coming home. Denísov was a small man with a red face,<br>sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair. He wore an<br>unfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled<br>shako on the back of his head. He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging<br>his head.<br><br>“Lavwúska!” he shouted loudly and angrily, “take it off,<br>blockhead!”<br><br>“Well, I am taking it off,” replied Lavrúshka’s voice.<br><br>“Ah, you’re up already,” said Denísov, entering the room.<br><br>“Long ago,” answered Rostóv, “I have already been for the hay,<br>and have seen Fräulein Mathilde.”<br><br>“Weally! And I’ve been losing, bwother. I lost yesterday like a<br>damned fool!” cried Denísov, not pronouncing his r’s. “Such ill<br>luck! Such ill luck. As soon as you left, it began and went on. Hullo<br>there! Tea!”<br><br>Puckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong<br>teeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick<br>tangled black hair.<br><br>“And what devil made me go to that wat?” (an officer nicknamed<br>“the rat”) he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both<br>hands. “Just fancy, he didn’t let me win a single cahd, not one<br>cahd.”<br><br>He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in his<br>fist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while he<br>continued to shout.<br><br>“He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it;<br>gives the singles and snatches the doubles!”<br><br>He scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it away.<br>Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked cheerfully<br>with his glittering, black eyes at Rostóv.<br><br>“If at least we had some women here; but there’s nothing foh one<br>to do but dwink. If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, who’s<br>there?” he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy<br>boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a respectful<br>cough.<br><br>“The squadron quartermaster!” said Lavrúshka.<br><br>Denísov’s face puckered still more.<br><br>“Wetched!” he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in it.<br>“Wostóv, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove the<br>purse undah the pillow,” he said, and went out to the quartermaster.<br><br>Rostóv took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins<br>in separate piles, began counting them.<br><br>“Ah! Telyánin! How d’ye do? They plucked me last night,” came<br>Denísov’s voice from the next room.<br><br>“Where? At Bykov’s, at the rat’s... I knew it,” replied a piping<br>voice, and Lieutenant Telyánin, a small officer of the same squadron,<br>entered the room.<br><br>Rostóv thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand<br>which was offered him. Telyánin for some reason had been transferred<br>from the Guards just before this campaign. He behaved very well in the<br>regiment but was not liked; Rostóv especially detested him and was<br>unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man.<br><br>“Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?” he asked. (Rook<br>was a young horse Telyánin had sold to Rostóv.)<br><br>The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the<br>face; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another.<br><br>“I saw you riding this morning...” he added.<br><br>“Oh, he’s all right, a good horse,” answered Rostóv, though the<br>horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half<br>that sum. “He’s begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg,” he<br>added.<br><br>“The hoof’s cracked! That’s nothing. I’ll teach you what to do<br>and show you what kind of rivet to use.”<br><br>“Yes, please do,” said Rostóv.<br><br>“I’ll show you, I’ll show you! It’s not a secret. And it’s a<br>horse you’ll thank me for.”<br><br>“Then I’ll have it brought round,” said Rostóv wishing to avoid<br>Telyánin, and he went out to give the order.<br><br>In the passage Denísov, with a pipe, was squatting on the threshold<br>facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing Rostóv,<br>Denísov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his<br>thumb to the room where Telyánin was sitting, he frowned and gave a<br>shudder of disgust.<br><br>“Ugh! I don’t like that fellow,” he said, regardless of the<br>quartermaster’s presence.<br><br>Rostóv shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: “Nor do I, but<br>what’s one to do?” and, having given his order, he returned to<br>Telyánin.<br><br>Telyánin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostóv had<br>left him, rubbing his small white hands.<br><br>“Well there certainly are disgusting people,” thought Rostóv as he<br>entered.<br><br>“Have you told them to bring the horse?” asked Telyánin, getting up<br>and looking carelessly about him.<br><br>“I have.”<br><br>“Let us go ourselves. I only came round to ask Denísov about<br>yesterday’s order. Have you got it, Denísov?”<br><br>“Not yet. But where are you off to?”<br><br>“I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse,” said<br>Telyánin.<br><br>They went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant<br>explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters.<br><br>When Rostóv went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the<br>table. Denísov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of<br>paper. He looked gloomily in Rostóv’s face and said: “I am witing<br>to her.”<br><br>He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and,<br>evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to<br>write, told Rostóv the contents of his letter.<br><br>“You see, my fwiend,” he said, “we sleep when we don’t love. We<br>are childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God, one<br>is pua’ as on the fihst day of cweation... Who’s that now? Send him<br>to the devil, I’m busy!” he shouted to Lavrúshka, who went up to<br>him not in the least abashed.<br><br>“Who should it be? You yourself told him to come. It’s the<br>quartermaster for the money.”<br><br>Denísov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped.<br><br>“Wetched business,” he muttered to himself. “How much is left in<br>the puhse?” he asked, turning to Rostóv.<br><br>“Seven new and three old imperials.”<br><br>“Oh, it’s wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you<br>sca’cwow? Call the quahtehmasteh,” he shouted to Lavrúshka.<br><br>“Please, Denísov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know,”<br>said Rostóv, blushing.<br><br>“Don’t like bowwowing from my own fellows, I don’t,” growled<br>Denísov.<br><br>“But if you won’t accept money from me like a comrade, you will<br>offend me. Really I have some,” Rostóv repeated.<br><br>“No, I tell you.”<br><br>And Denísov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow.<br><br>“Where have you put it, Wostóv?”<br><br>“Under the lower pillow.”<br><br>“It’s not there.”<br><br>Denísov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there.<br><br>“That’s a miwacle.”<br><br>“Wait, haven’t you dropped it?” said Rostóv, picking up the<br>pillows one at a time and shaking them.<br><br>He pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there.<br><br>“Dear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you kept<br>it under your head like a treasure,” said Rostóv. “I put it just<br>here. Where is it?” he asked, turning to Lavrúshka.<br><br>“I haven’t been in the room. It must be where you put it.”<br><br>“But it isn’t?...”<br><br>“You’re always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget<br>it. Feel in your pockets.”<br><br>“No, if I hadn’t thought of it being a treasure,” said Rostóv,<br>“but I remember putting it there.”<br><br>Lavrúshka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and under<br>the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of the<br>room. Denísov silently watched Lavrúshka’s movements, and when the<br>latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found<br>Denísov glanced at Rostóv.<br><br>“Wostóv, you’ve not been playing schoolboy twicks...”<br><br>Rostóv felt Denísov’s gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and<br>instantly dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested<br>somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not<br>draw breath.<br><br>“And there hasn’t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and<br>yourselves. It must be here somewhere,” said Lavrúshka.<br><br>“Now then, you devil’s puppet, look alive and hunt for it!”<br>shouted Denísov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with<br>a threatening gesture. “If the purse isn’t found I’ll flog you,<br>I’ll flog you all.”<br><br>Rostóv, his eyes avoiding Denísov, began buttoning his coat, buckled<br>on his saber, and put on his cap.<br><br>“I must have that purse, I tell you,” shouted Denísov, shaking his<br>orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.<br><br>“Denísov, let him alone, I know who has taken it,” said Rostóv,<br>going toward the door without raising his eyes. Denísov paused, thought<br>a moment, and, evidently understanding what Rostóv hinted at, seized<br>his arm.<br><br>“Nonsense!” he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood<br>out like cords. “You are mad, I tell you. I won’t allow it.<br>The purse is here! I’ll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be<br>found.”<br><br>“I know who has taken it,” repeated Rostóv in an unsteady voice,<br>and went to the door.<br><br>“And I tell you, don’t you dahe to do it!” shouted Denísov,<br>rushing at the cadet to restrain him.<br><br>But Rostóv pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though<br>Denísov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his<br>face.<br><br>“Do you understand what you’re saying?” he said in a trembling<br>voice. “There was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it<br>is not so, then...”<br><br>He could not finish, and ran out of the room.<br><br>“Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody,” were the last words<br>Rostóv heard.<br><br>Rostóv went to Telyánin’s quarters.<br><br>“The master is not in, he’s gone to headquarters,” said<br>Telyánin’s orderly. “Has something happened?” he added, surprised<br>at the cadet’s troubled face.<br><br>“No, nothing.”<br><br>“You’ve only just missed him,” said the orderly.<br><br>The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and<br>Rostóv, without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was<br>an inn in the village which the officers frequented. Rostóv rode up to<br>it and saw Telyánin’s horse at the porch.<br><br>In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of<br>sausages and a bottle of wine.<br><br>“Ah, you’ve come here too, young man!” he said, smiling and<br>raising his eyebrows.<br><br>“Yes,” said Rostóv as if it cost him a great deal to utter the<br>word; and he sat down at the nearest table.<br><br>Both were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the<br>room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives<br>and the munching of the lieutenant.<br><br>When Telyánin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double<br>purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white, turned-up<br>fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eyebrows gave it to<br>the waiter.<br><br>“Please be quick,” he said.<br><br>The coin was a new one. Rostóv rose and went up to Telyánin.<br><br>“Allow me to look at your purse,” he said in a low, almost<br>inaudible, voice.<br><br>With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyánin handed him the<br>purse.<br><br>“Yes, it’s a nice purse. Yes, yes,” he said, growing suddenly<br>pale, and added, “Look at it, young man.”<br><br>Rostóv took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and<br>looked at Telyánin. The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way<br>and suddenly seemed to grow very merry.<br><br>“If we get to Vienna I’ll get rid of it there but in these wretched<br>little towns there’s nowhere to spend it,” said he. “Well, let me<br>have it, young man, I’m going.”<br><br>Rostóv did not speak.<br><br>“And you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite<br>decently here,” continued Telyánin. “Now then, let me have it.”<br><br>He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. Rostóv let go of<br>it. Telyánin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the<br>pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth<br>slightly open, as if to say, “Yes, yes, I am putting my purse in my<br>pocket and that’s quite simple and is no one else’s business.”<br><br>“Well, young man?” he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted<br>brows he glanced into Rostóv’s eyes.<br><br>Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyánin’s eyes to<br>Rostóv’s and back, and back again and again in an instant.<br><br>“Come here,” said Rostóv, catching hold of Telyánin’s arm and<br>almost dragging him to the window. “That money is Denísov’s; you<br>took it...” he whispered just above Telyánin’s ear.<br><br>“What? What? How dare you? What?” said Telyánin.<br><br>But these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for<br>pardon. As soon as Rostóv heard them, an enormous load of doubt<br>fell from him. He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the<br>miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be<br>completed.<br><br>“Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine,” muttered<br>Telyánin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room. “We<br>must have an explanation...”<br><br>“I know it and shall prove it,” said Rostóv.<br><br>“I...”<br><br>Every muscle of Telyánin’s pale, terrified face began to quiver, his<br>eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising<br>to Rostóv’s face, and his sobs were audible.<br><br>“Count!... Don’t ruin a young fellow... here is this wretched money,<br>take it...” He threw it on the table. “I have an old father and<br>mother!...”<br><br>Rostóv took the money, avoiding Telyánin’s eyes, and went out of the<br>room without a word. But at the door he stopped and then retraced his<br>steps. “O God,” he said with tears in his eyes, “how could you do<br>it?”<br><br>“Count...” said Telyánin drawing nearer to him.<br><br>“Don’t touch me,” said Rostóv, drawing back. “If you need it,<br>take the money,” and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>That same evening there was an animated discussion among the<br>squadron’s officers in Denísov’s quarters.<br><br>“And I tell you, Rostóv, that you must apologize to the colonel!”<br>said a tall, grizzly-haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and<br>many wrinkles on his large features, to Rostóv who was crimson with<br>excitement.<br><br>The staff captain, Kírsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks for<br>affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission.<br><br>“I will allow no one to call me a liar!” cried Rostóv. “He told<br>me I lied, and I told him he lied. And there it rests. He may keep me<br>on duty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make<br>me apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it<br>beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then...”<br><br>“You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,” interrupted<br>the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache.<br>“You tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an<br>officer has stolen...”<br><br>“I’m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of<br>other officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am<br>not a diplomatist. That’s why I joined the hussars, thinking that here<br>one would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lying—so let him<br>give me satisfaction...”<br><br>“That’s all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that’s not the<br>point. Ask Denísov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to<br>demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?”<br><br>Denísov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the<br>conversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it. He answered the<br>staff captain’s question by a disapproving shake of his head.<br><br>“You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other<br>officers,” continued the staff captain, “and Bogdánich” (the<br>colonel was called Bogdánich) “shuts you up.”<br><br>“He did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth.”<br><br>“Well, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must<br>apologize.”<br><br>“Not on any account!” exclaimed Rostóv.<br><br>“I did not expect this of you,” said the staff captain seriously and<br>severely. “You don’t wish to apologize, but, man, it’s not only to<br>him but to the whole regiment—all of us—you’re to blame all round.<br>The case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and<br>taken advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the<br>officers. Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and<br>disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one<br>scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We don’t see it like that. And<br>Bogdánich was a brick: he told you you were saying what was not true.<br>It’s not pleasant, but what’s to be done, my dear fellow? You landed<br>yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some<br>conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole<br>affair public. You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not<br>apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever Bogdánich may<br>be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel! You’re quick at<br>taking offense, but you don’t mind disgracing the whole regiment!”<br>The staff captain’s voice began to tremble. “You have been in the<br>regiment next to no time, my lad, you’re here today and tomorrow<br>you’ll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when<br>it is said ‘There are thieves among the Pávlograd officers!’ But<br>it’s not all the same to us! Am I not right, Denísov? It’s not the<br>same!”<br><br>Denísov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked with<br>his glittering black eyes at Rostóv.<br><br>“You value your own pride and don’t wish to apologize,” continued<br>the staff captain, “but we old fellows, who have grown up in and, God<br>willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of the<br>regiment, and Bogdánich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old fellow! And<br>all this is not right, it’s not right! You may take offense or not but<br>I always stick to mother truth. It’s not right!”<br><br>And the staff captain rose and turned away from Rostóv.<br><br>“That’s twue, devil take it!” shouted Denísov, jumping up. “Now<br>then, Wostóv, now then!”<br><br>Rostóv, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one officer<br>and then at the other.<br><br>“No, gentlemen, no... you mustn’t think... I quite understand.<br>You’re wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of<br>the regiment I’d... Ah well, I’ll show that in action, and for me<br>the honor of the flag... Well, never mind, it’s true I’m to blame,<br>to blame all round. Well, what else do you want?...”<br><br>“Come, that’s right, Count!” cried the staff captain, turning<br>round and clapping Rostóv on the shoulder with his big hand.<br><br>“I tell you,” shouted Denísov, “he’s a fine fellow.”<br><br>“That’s better, Count,” said the staff captain, beginning to<br>address Rostóv by his title, as if in recognition of his confession.<br>“Go and apologize, your excellency. Yes, go!”<br><br>“Gentlemen, I’ll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me,”<br>said Rostóv in an imploring voice, “but I can’t apologize, by God I<br>can’t, do what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little boy<br>asking forgiveness?”<br><br>Denísov began to laugh.<br><br>“It’ll be worse for you. Bogdánich is vindictive and you’ll pay<br>for your obstinacy,” said Kírsten.<br><br>“No, on my word it’s not obstinacy! I can’t describe the feeling.<br>I can’t...”<br><br>“Well, it’s as you like,” said the staff captain. “And what has<br>become of that scoundrel?” he asked Denísov.<br><br>“He has weported himself sick, he’s to be stwuck off the list<br>tomowwow,” muttered Denísov.<br><br>“It is an illness, there’s no other way of explaining it,” said<br>the staff captain.<br><br>“Illness or not, he’d better not cwoss my path. I’d kill him!”<br>shouted Denísov in a bloodthirsty tone.<br><br>Just then Zherkóv entered the room.<br><br>“What brings you here?” cried the officers turning to the newcomer.<br><br>“We’re to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with his<br>whole army.”<br><br>“It’s not true!”<br><br>“I’ve seen him myself!”<br><br>“What? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?”<br><br>“Into action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such news! But how<br>did you come here?”<br><br>“I’ve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil,<br>Mack. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him on<br>Mack’s arrival... What’s the matter, Rostóv? You look as if you’d<br>just come out of a hot bath.”<br><br>“Oh, my dear fellow, we’re in such a stew here these last two<br>days.”<br><br>The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by<br>Zherkóv. They were under orders to advance next day.<br><br>“We’re going into action, gentlemen!”<br><br>“Well, thank God! We’ve been sitting here too long!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>Kutúzov fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges over<br>the rivers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz). On October 23 the<br>Russian troops were crossing the river Enns. At midday the Russian<br>baggage train, the artillery, and columns of troops were defiling<br>through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge.<br><br>It was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened out<br>before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the<br>bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and<br>then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could<br>be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down below,<br>the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its<br>cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling<br>masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island,<br>and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of<br>the Enns and the Danube became visible, and the rocky left bank of the<br>Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green<br>treetops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a<br>wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the<br>enemy’s horse patrols could be discerned.<br><br>Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of<br>the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through<br>his fieldglass. A little behind them Nesvítski, who had been sent to<br>the rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a<br>gun carriage. A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack<br>and a flask, and Nesvítski was treating some officers to pies and real<br>doppelkümmel. The officers gladly gathered round him, some on their<br>knees, some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass.<br><br>“Yes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool. It’s<br>a fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?” Nesvítski<br>was saying.<br><br>“Thank you very much, Prince,” answered one of the officers, pleased<br>to be talking to a staff officer of such importance. “It’s a lovely<br>place! We passed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a<br>splendid house!”<br><br>“Look, Prince,” said another, who would have dearly liked to take<br>another pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining the<br>countryside—“See, our infantrymen have already got there. Look there<br>in the meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging something.<br>They’ll ransack that castle,” he remarked with evident approval.<br><br>“So they will,” said Nesvítski. “No, but what I should like,”<br>added he, munching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, “would be<br>to slip in over there.”<br><br>He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed and<br>gleamed.<br><br>“That would be fine, gentlemen!”<br><br>The officers laughed.<br><br>“Just to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls<br>among them. On my word I’d give five years of my life for it!”<br><br>“They must be feeling dull, too,” said one of the bolder officers,<br>laughing.<br><br>Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to<br>the general, who looked through his field glass.<br><br>“Yes, so it is, so it is,” said the general angrily, lowering the<br>field glass and shrugging his shoulders, “so it is! They’ll be fired<br>on at the crossing. And why are they dawdling there?”<br><br>On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and from<br>their battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant report of<br>a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.<br><br>Nesvítski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.<br><br>“Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?” he said.<br><br>“It’s a bad business,” said the general without answering him,<br>“our men have been wasting time.”<br><br>“Hadn’t I better ride over, your excellency?” asked Nesvítski.<br><br>“Yes, please do,” answered the general, and he repeated the order<br>that had already once been given in detail: “and tell the hussars<br>that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the<br>inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected.”<br><br>“Very good,” answered Nesvítski.<br><br>He called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack<br>and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.<br><br>“I’ll really call in on the nuns,” he said to the officers who<br>watched him smilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the<br>hill.<br><br>“Now then, let’s see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!”<br>said the general, turning to an artillery officer. “Have a little fun<br>to pass the time.”<br><br>“Crew, to your guns!” commanded the officer.<br><br>In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began<br>loading.<br><br>“One!” came the command.<br><br>Number one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening<br>metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our<br>troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke<br>showing the spot where it burst.<br><br>The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone got<br>up and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly<br>visible as if but a stone’s throw away, and the movements of the<br>approaching enemy farther off. At the same instant the sun came fully<br>out from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the solitary shot<br>and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and<br>spirited impression.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>Two of the enemy’s shots had already flown across the bridge, where<br>there was a crush. Halfway across stood Prince Nesvítski, who had<br>alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the<br>railings. He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few<br>steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles. Each time Prince<br>Nesvítski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again<br>and pressed him against the railings, and all he could do was to smile.<br><br>“What a fine fellow you are, friend!” said the Cossack to a convoy<br>soldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were<br>crowded together close to his wheels and his horses. “What a fellow!<br>You can’t wait a moment! Don’t you see the general wants to pass?”<br><br>But the convoyman took no notice of the word “general” and shouted<br>at the soldiers who were blocking his way. “Hi there, boys! Keep to<br>the left! Wait a bit.” But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to<br>shoulder, their bayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge in a dense<br>mass. Looking down over the rails Prince Nesvítski saw the rapid, noisy<br>little waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying round the piles of<br>the bridge chased each other along. Looking on the bridge he saw equally<br>uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos,<br>knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with<br>broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and<br>feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the<br>bridge. Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of<br>white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with<br>a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way along;<br>sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot,<br>an orderly, or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry;<br>and sometimes like a log floating down the river, an officers’ or<br>company’s baggage wagon, piled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on<br>all sides, moved across the bridge.<br><br>“It’s as if a dam had burst,” said the Cossack hopelessly. “Are<br>there many more of you to come?”<br><br>“A million all but one!” replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat,<br>with a wink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.<br><br>“If he” (he meant the enemy) “begins popping at the bridge now,”<br>said the old soldier dismally to a comrade, “you’ll forget to<br>scratch yourself.”<br><br>That soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a cart.<br><br>“Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?” said an<br>orderly, running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.<br><br>And he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry soldiers who<br>had evidently been drinking.<br><br>“And then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt<br>end of his gun...” a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said<br>gaily, with a wide swing of his arm.<br><br>“Yes, the ham was just delicious...” answered another with a loud<br>laugh. And they, too, passed on, so that Nesvítski did not learn who<br>had been struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.<br><br>“Bah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think they’ll<br>all be killed,” a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.<br><br>“As it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean,” said a young soldier<br>with an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, “I felt like<br>dying of fright. I did, ‘pon my word, I got that frightened!” said<br>he, as if bragging of having been frightened.<br><br>That one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone<br>before. It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German, and<br>seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine brindled cow with<br>a large udder was attached to the cart behind. A woman with an unweaned<br>baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks<br>were sitting on some feather beds. Evidently these fugitives were<br>allowed to pass by special permission. The eyes of all the soldiers<br>turned toward the women, and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace<br>all the soldiers’ remarks related to the two young ones. Every face<br>bore almost the same smile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the<br>women.<br><br>“Just see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!”<br><br>“Sell me the missis,” said another soldier, addressing the German,<br>who, angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast<br>eyes.<br><br>“See how smart she’s made herself! Oh, the devils!”<br><br>“There, Fedótov, you should be quartered on them!”<br><br>“I have seen as much before now, mate!”<br><br>“Where are you going?” asked an infantry officer who was eating an<br>apple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl.<br><br>The German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand.<br><br>“Take it if you like,” said the officer, giving the girl an apple.<br><br>The girl smiled and took it. Nesvítski like the rest of the men on the<br>bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed. When<br>they had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with the same<br>kind of talk, and at last all stopped. As often happens, the horses of<br>a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge, and the whole<br>crowd had to wait.<br><br>“And why are they stopping? There’s no proper order!” said the<br>soldiers. “Where are you shoving to? Devil take you! Can’t you wait?<br>It’ll be worse if he fires the bridge. See, here’s an officer jammed<br>in too”—different voices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked<br>at one another, and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge.<br><br>Looking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, Nesvítski<br>suddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching...<br>something big, that splashed into the water.<br><br>“Just see where it carries to!” a soldier near by said sternly,<br>looking round at the sound.<br><br>“Encouraging us to get along quicker,” said another uneasily.<br><br>The crowd moved on again. Nesvítski realized that it was a cannon ball.<br><br>“Hey, Cossack, my horse!” he said. “Now, then, you there! get out<br>of the way! Make way!”<br><br>With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting<br>continually he moved on. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way<br>for him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and those<br>nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still<br>harder from behind.<br><br>“Nesvítski, Nesvítski! you numskull!” came a hoarse voice from<br>behind him.<br><br>Nesvítski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but separated<br>by the living mass of moving infantry, Váska Denísov, red and shaggy,<br>with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily<br>over his shoulder.<br><br>“Tell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!” shouted Denísov<br>evidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot<br>whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small<br>bare hand as red as his face.<br><br>“Ah, Váska!” joyfully replied Nesvítski. “What’s up with<br>you?”<br><br>“The squadwon can’t pass,” shouted Váska Denísov, showing his<br>white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which<br>twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting<br>white foam from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his<br>hoofs, and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let<br>him. “What is this? They’re like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of the<br>way!... Let us pass!... Stop there, you devil with the cart! I’ll hack<br>you with my saber!” he shouted, actually drawing his saber from its<br>scabbard and flourishing it.<br><br>The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and<br>Denísov joined Nesvítski.<br><br>“How’s it you’re not drunk today?” said Nesvítski when the<br>other had ridden up to him.<br><br>“They don’t even give one time to dwink!” answered Váska<br>Denísov. “They keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If they<br>mean to fight, let’s fight. But the devil knows what this is.”<br><br>“What a dandy you are today!” said Nesvítski, looking at<br>Denísov’s new cloak and saddlecloth.<br><br>Denísov smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused<br>a smell of perfume, and put it to Nesvítski’s nose.<br><br>“Of course. I’m going into action! I’ve shaved, bwushed my teeth,<br>and scented myself.”<br><br>The imposing figure of Nesvítski followed by his Cossack, and<br>the determination of Denísov who flourished his sword and shouted<br>frantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through<br>to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the<br>bridge Nesvítski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order,<br>and having done this he rode back.<br><br>Having cleared the way Denísov stopped at the end of the bridge.<br>Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the<br>ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw<br>nearer. Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping,<br>resounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in<br>front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to emerge<br>on his side of it.<br><br>The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the<br>trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will,<br>estrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually<br>encounter one another at the clean, smart hussars who moved past them in<br>regular order.<br><br>“Smart lads! Only fit for a fair!” said one.<br><br>“What good are they? They’re led about just for show!” remarked<br>another.<br><br>“Don’t kick up the dust, you infantry!” jested an hussar whose<br>prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers.<br><br>“I’d like to put you on a two days’ march with a knapsack! Your<br>fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed,” said an infantryman, wiping<br>the mud off his face with his sleeve. “Perched up there, you’re more<br>like a bird than a man.”<br><br>“There now, Zíkin, they ought to put you on a horse. You’d look<br>fine,” said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under<br>the weight of his knapsack.<br><br>“Take a stick between your legs, that’ll suit you for a horse!”<br>the hussar shouted back.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing<br>together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel. At last<br>the baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last<br>battalion came onto the bridge. Only Denísov’s squadron of hussars<br>remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could<br>be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from<br>the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the<br>river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away.<br>At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our<br>Cossack scouts were moving. Suddenly on the road at the top of the high<br>ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen. These were the<br>French. A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot. All<br>the officers and men of Denísov’s squadron, though they tried to talk<br>of other things and to look in other directions, thought only of what<br>was there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the patches<br>appearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the enemy’s troops.<br>The weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending<br>brightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around it. It was calm, and<br>at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard<br>from the hill. There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy<br>except a few scattered skirmishers. An empty space of some seven hundred<br>yards was all that separated them. The enemy ceased firing, and that<br>stern, threatening, inaccessible, and intangible line which separates<br>two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt.<br><br>“One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing<br>the living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and death. And<br>what is there? Who is there?—there beyond that field, that tree, that<br>roof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to know. You fear<br>and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner or later it must<br>be crossed and you will have to find out what is there, just as you will<br>inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death. But you are<br>strong, healthy, cheerful, and excited, and are surrounded by other such<br>excitedly animated and healthy men.” So thinks, or at any rate<br>feels, anyone who comes in sight of the enemy, and that feeling gives<br>a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that<br>takes place at such moments.<br><br>On the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon rose,<br>and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The<br>officers who had been standing together rode off to their places. The<br>hussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the whole<br>squadron. All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron<br>commander, awaiting the word of command. A second and a third cannon<br>ball flew past. Evidently they were firing at the hussars, but the balls<br>with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell<br>somewhere beyond them. The hussars did not look round, but at the sound<br>of each shot, as at the word of command, the whole squadron with its<br>rows of faces so alike yet so different, holding its breath while the<br>ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and sank back again. The soldiers<br>without turning their heads glanced at one another, curious to see their<br>comrades’ impression. Every face, from Denísov’s to that of the<br>bugler, showed one common expression of conflict, irritation, and<br>excitement, around chin and mouth. The quartermaster frowned, looking<br>at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them. Cadet Mirónov ducked<br>every time a ball flew past. Rostóv on the left flank, mounted on his<br>Rook—a handsome horse despite its game leg—had the happy air of a<br>schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which<br>he feels sure he will distinguish himself. He was glancing at everyone<br>with a clear, bright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly<br>he sat under fire. But despite himself, on his face too that same<br>indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth.<br><br>“Who’s that curtseying there? Cadet Miwónov! That’s not wight!<br>Look at me,” cried Denísov who, unable to keep still on one spot,<br>kept turning his horse in front of the squadron.<br><br>The black, hairy, snub-nosed face of Váska Denísov, and his whole<br>short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in<br>which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually<br>did, especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he<br>was only redder than usual. With his shaggy head thrown back like birds<br>when they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his<br>good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the<br>saddle, he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in<br>a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols. He rode up to<br>Kírsten. The staff captain on his broad-backed, steady mare came at a<br>walk to meet him. His face with its long mustache was serious as always,<br>only his eyes were brighter than usual.<br><br>“Well, what about it?” said he to Denísov. “It won’t come to a<br>fight. You’ll see—we shall retire.”<br><br>“The devil only knows what they’re about!” muttered Denísov.<br>“Ah, Wostóv,” he cried noticing the cadet’s bright face,<br>“you’ve got it at last.”<br><br>And he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet. Rostóv<br>felt perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the bridge.<br>Denísov galloped up to him.<br><br>“Your excellency! Let us attack them! I’ll dwive them off.”<br><br>“Attack indeed!” said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his<br>face as if driving off a troublesome fly. “And why are you stopping<br>here? Don’t you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron<br>back.”<br><br>The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without<br>having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in the front<br>line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side<br>of the river.<br><br>The two Pávlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the<br>hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogdánich Schubert, came<br>up to Denísov’s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostóv,<br>without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the<br>first time since their encounter concerning Telyánin. Rostóv, feeling<br>that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now<br>admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the<br>colonel’s athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red<br>neck. It seemed to Rostóv that Bogdánich was only pretending not<br>to notice him, and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet’s<br>courage, so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily; then it<br>seemed to him that Bogdánich rode so near in order to show him his<br>courage. Next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a<br>desperate attack just to punish him—Rostóv. Then he imagined how,<br>after the attack, Bogdánich would come up to him as he lay wounded and<br>would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation.<br><br>The high-shouldered figure of Zherkóv, familiar to the Pávlograds as<br>he had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel.<br>After his dismissal from headquarters Zherkóv had not remained in the<br>regiment, saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he<br>could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and had succeeded<br>in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagratión. He now<br>came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear<br>guard.<br><br>“Colonel,” he said, addressing Rostóv’s enemy with an air of<br>gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades, “there is an order<br>to stop and fire the bridge.”<br><br>“An order to who?” asked the colonel morosely.<br><br>“I don’t myself know ‘to who,’” replied the cornet in a<br>serious tone, “but the prince told me to ‘go and tell the colonel<br>that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.’”<br><br>Zherkóv was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the<br>colonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout Nesvítski<br>came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his<br>weight.<br><br>“How’s this, Colonel?” he shouted as he approached. “I told you<br>to fire the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all<br>beside themselves over there and one can’t make anything out.”<br><br>The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvítski.<br><br>“You spoke to me of inflammable material,” said he, “but you said<br>nothing about firing it.”<br><br>“But, my dear sir,” said Nesvítski as he drew up, taking off his<br>cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand,<br>“wasn’t I telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material<br>had been put in position?”<br><br>“I am not your ‘dear sir,’ Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell<br>me to burn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders<br>strictly to obey. You said the bridge would be burned, but who would it<br>burn, I could not know by the holy spirit!”<br><br>“Ah, that’s always the way!” said Nesvítski with a wave of the<br>hand. “How did you get here?” said he, turning to Zherkóv.<br><br>“On the same business. But you are damp! Let me wring you out!”<br><br>“You were saying, Mr. Staff Officer...” continued the colonel in an<br>offended tone.<br><br>“Colonel,” interrupted the officer of the suite, “You must be<br>quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot.”<br><br>The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout<br>staff officer, and at Zherkóv, and he frowned.<br><br>“I will the bridge fire,” he said in a solemn tone as if to announce<br>that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still<br>do the right thing.<br><br>Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame<br>for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second<br>squadron, that in which Rostóv was serving under Denísov, to return to<br>the bridge.<br><br>“There, it’s just as I thought,” said Rostóv to himself. “He<br>wishes to test me!” His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his<br>face. “Let him see whether I am a coward!” he thought.<br><br>Again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression<br>appeared that they had worn when under fire. Rostóv watched his enemy,<br>the colonel, closely—to find in his face confirmation of his own<br>conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rostóv, and looked<br>as he always did when at the front, solemn and stern. Then came the word<br>of command.<br><br>“Look sharp! Look sharp!” several voices repeated around him.<br><br>Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the<br>hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The men<br>were crossing themselves. Rostóv no longer looked at the colonel, he<br>had no time. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid<br>that his heart stood still. His hand trembled as he gave his horse into<br>an orderly’s charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with<br>a thud. Denísov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something.<br>Rostóv saw nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs<br>catching and their sabers clattering.<br><br>“Stretchers!” shouted someone behind him.<br><br>Rostóv did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on,<br>trying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not<br>looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled,<br>and fell on his hands. The others outstripped him.<br><br>“At boss zides, Captain,” he heard the voice of the colonel, who,<br>having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a<br>triumphant, cheerful face.<br><br>Rostóv wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and<br>was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front<br>the better. But Bogdánich, without looking at or recognizing Rostóv,<br>shouted to him:<br><br>“Who’s that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come<br>back, Cadet!” he cried angrily; and turning to Denísov, who, showing<br>off his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:<br><br>“Why run risks, Captain? You should dismount,” he said.<br><br>“Oh, every bullet has its billet,” answered Váska Denísov, turning<br>in his saddle.<br><br><br>Meanwhile Nesvítski, Zherkóv, and the officer of the suite were<br>standing together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small<br>group of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord,<br>and blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at<br>what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side—the blue<br>uniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery.<br><br>“Will they burn the bridge or not? Who’ll get there first? Will they<br>get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot<br>range and wipe them out?” These were the questions each man of the<br>troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself<br>with a sinking heart—watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright<br>evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with<br>their bayonets and guns.<br><br>“Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!” said Nesvítski; “they are<br>within grapeshot range now.”<br><br>“He shouldn’t have taken so many men,” said the officer of the<br>suite.<br><br>“True enough,” answered Nesvítski; “two smart fellows could have<br>done the job just as well.”<br><br>“Ah, your excellency,” put in Zherkóv, his eyes fixed on the<br>hussars, but still with that naïve air that made it impossible to know<br>whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. “Ah, your excellency!<br>How you look at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the<br>Vladímir medal and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered, the<br>squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon. Our<br>Bogdánich knows how things are done.”<br><br>“There now!” said the officer of the suite, “that’s<br>grapeshot.”<br><br>He pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being detached<br>and hurriedly removed.<br><br>On the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke<br>appeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at the<br>moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two<br>reports one after another, and a third.<br><br>“Oh! Oh!” groaned Nesvítski as if in fierce pain, seizing the<br>officer of the suite by the arm. “Look! A man has fallen! Fallen,<br>fallen!”<br><br>“Two, I think.”<br><br>“If I were Tsar I would never go to war,” said Nesvítski, turning<br>away.<br><br>The French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their blue<br>uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared again<br>but at irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the<br>bridge. But this time Nesvítski could not see what was happening there,<br>as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had succeeded in<br>setting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them, no<br>longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was<br>someone to fire at.<br><br>The French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars<br>got back to their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot went too<br>high, but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and<br>knocked three of them over.<br><br>Rostóv, absorbed by his relations with Bogdánich, had paused on the<br>bridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he<br>had always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the<br>bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the<br>other soldiers. He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a<br>rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest<br>to him fell against the rails with a groan. Rostóv ran up to him with<br>the others. Again someone shouted, “Stretchers!” Four men seized the<br>hussar and began lifting him.<br><br>“Oooh! For Christ’s sake let me alone!” cried the wounded man, but<br>still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.<br><br>Nicholas Rostóv turned away and, as if searching for something, gazed<br>into the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at the<br>sun. How beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm, and how deep!<br>How bright and glorious was the setting sun! With what soft glitter the<br>waters of the distant Danube shone. And fairer still were the faraway<br>blue mountains beyond the river, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and<br>the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits... There was peace<br>and happiness... “I should wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I<br>were there,” thought Rostóv. “In myself alone and in that sunshine<br>there is so much happiness; but here... groans, suffering, fear, and<br>this uncertainty and hurry... There—they are shouting again, and<br>again are all running back somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it,<br>death, is here above me and around... Another instant and I shall never<br>again see the sun, this water, that gorge!...”<br><br>At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other<br>stretchers came into view before Rostóv. And the fear of death and of<br>the stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one<br>feeling of sickening agitation.<br><br>“O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect<br>me!” Rostóv whispered.<br><br>The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their voices<br>sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight.<br><br>“Well, fwiend? So you’ve smelt powdah!” shouted Váska Denísov<br>just above his ear.<br><br>“It’s all over; but I am a coward—yes, a coward!” thought<br>Rostóv, and sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting<br>one foot, from the orderly and began to mount.<br><br>“Was that grapeshot?” he asked Denísov.<br><br>“Yes and no mistake!” cried Denísov. “You worked like wegular<br>bwicks and it’s nasty work! An attack’s pleasant work! Hacking<br>away at the dogs! But this sort of thing is the very devil, with them<br>shooting at you like a target.”<br><br>And Denísov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rostóv, composed<br>of the colonel, Nesvítski, Zherkóv, and the officer from the suite.<br><br>“Well, it seems that no one has noticed,” thought Rostóv. And this<br>was true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the sensation<br>which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.<br><br>“Here’s something for you to report,” said Zherkóv. “See if I<br>don’t get promoted to a sublieutenancy.”<br><br>“Inform the prince that I the bridge fired!” said the colonel<br>triumphantly and gaily.<br><br>“And if he asks about the losses?”<br><br>“A trifle,” said the colonel in his bass voice: “two hussars<br>wounded, and one knocked out,” he added, unable to restrain a happy<br>smile, and pronouncing the phrase “knocked out” with ringing<br>distinctness.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command<br>of Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly to it,<br>losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies,<br>and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had<br>been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded<br>by Kutúzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube, stopping where<br>overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as<br>necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment.<br>There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the<br>courage and endurance—acknowledged even by the enemy—with which the<br>Russians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet more<br>rapid retreat. Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had<br>joined Kutúzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and<br>Kutúzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces. The<br>defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. Instead of an<br>offensive, the plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the<br>modern science of strategics, had been handed to Kutúzov when he was in<br>Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable<br>aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were<br>advancing from Russia, without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.<br><br>On the twenty-eighth of October Kutúzov with his army crossed to the<br>left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time<br>with the river between himself and the main body of the French. On the<br>thirtieth he attacked Mortier’s division, which was on the left bank,<br>and broke it up. In this action for the first time trophies were taken:<br>banners, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time, after a<br>fortnight’s retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a fight<br>had not only held the field but had repulsed the French. Though the<br>troops were ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of their number<br>in killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number of sick and<br>wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter<br>in which Kutúzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy; and<br>though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military<br>hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded, yet the<br>stand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of<br>the army considerably. Throughout the whole army and at headquarters<br>most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach<br>of columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians, and of<br>the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.<br><br>Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian<br>General Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His horse had been<br>wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet. As a mark<br>of the commander in chief’s special favor he was sent with the news of<br>this victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was<br>threatened by the French) but at Brünn. Despite his apparently delicate<br>build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many<br>very muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived<br>at Krems excited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokhtúrov to<br>Kutúzov, he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Brünn.<br>To be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward<br>promotion.<br><br>The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that<br>had fallen the previous day—the day of the battle. Reviewing his<br>impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the<br>impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the send-off<br>given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers, Prince<br>Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a<br>man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness. As soon<br>as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the<br>wheels and the sensation of victory. Then he began to imagine that<br>the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed, but he<br>quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that<br>this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away. He<br>again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage<br>during the battle, and feeling reassured he dozed off.... The dark<br>starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning. The snow was<br>thawing in the sunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides<br>of the road were forests of different kinds, fields, and villages.<br><br>At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded.<br>The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front<br>cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse. In each of<br>the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men were being<br>jolted over the stony road. Some of them were talking (he heard Russian<br>words), others were eating bread; the more severely wounded looked<br>silently, with the languid interest of sick children, at the envoy<br>hurrying past them.<br><br>Prince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what<br>action they had been wounded. “Day before yesterday, on the Danube,”<br>answered the soldier. Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the<br>soldier three gold pieces.<br><br>“That’s for them all,” he said to the officer who came up.<br><br>“Get well soon, lads!” he continued, turning to the soldiers.<br>“There’s plenty to do still.”<br><br>“What news, sir?” asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a<br>conversation.<br><br>“Good news!... Go on!” he shouted to the driver, and they galloped<br>on.<br><br>It was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over the paved<br>streets of Brünn and found himself surrounded by high buildings, the<br>lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all that<br>atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a<br>soldier after camp life. Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night,<br>Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and<br>alert than he had done the day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly<br>and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and<br>rapidity. He again vividly recalled the details of the battle, no longer<br>dim, but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself<br>stating them to the Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined the casual<br>questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give. He<br>expected to be at once presented to the Emperor. At the chief entrance<br>to the palace, however, an official came running out to meet him, and<br>learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance.<br><br>“To the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren! There you will find<br>the adjutant on duty,” said the official. “He will conduct you to<br>the Minister of War.”<br><br>The adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to wait, and went<br>in to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he returned and bowing<br>with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a<br>corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work. The<br>adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any<br>attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger.<br><br>Prince Andrew’s joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he<br>approached the door of the minister’s room. He felt offended, and<br>without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into<br>one of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind instantly<br>suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise<br>the adjutant and the minister. “Away from the smell of powder, they<br>probably think it easy to gain victories!” he thought. His eyes<br>narrowed disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with<br>peculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was heightened<br>when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers<br>and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three minutes<br>taking no notice of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each side of the<br>minister’s bent bald head with its gray temples. He went on reading<br>to the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the<br>sound of footsteps.<br><br>“Take this and deliver it,” said he to his adjutant, handing him the<br>papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger.<br><br>Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutúzov’s army<br>interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was<br>concerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that<br>impression. “But that is a matter of perfect indifference to me,” he<br>thought. The minister drew the remaining papers together, arranged them<br>evenly, and then raised his head. He had an intellectual and distinctive<br>head, but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent<br>expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and<br>habitual to him. His face took on the stupid artificial smile (which<br>does not even attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is<br>continually receiving many petitioners one after another.<br><br>“From General Field Marshal Kutúzov?” he asked. “I hope it is<br>good news? There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was<br>high time!”<br><br>He took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it<br>with a mournful expression.<br><br>“Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!” he exclaimed in German. “What a<br>calamity! What a calamity!”<br><br>Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked<br>at Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.<br><br>“Ah what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is<br>not captured.” Again he pondered. “I am very glad you have brought<br>good news, though Schmidt’s death is a heavy price to pay for the<br>victory. His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I<br>thank you! You must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the<br>parade. However, I will let you know.”<br><br>The stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking,<br>reappeared.<br><br>“Au revoir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably desire to<br>see you,” he added, bowing his head.<br><br>When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest<br>and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the<br>indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant. The<br>whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle seemed<br>the memory of a remote event long past.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>Prince Andrew stayed at Brünn with Bilíbin, a Russian acquaintance of<br>his in the diplomatic service.<br><br>“Ah, my dear prince! I could not have a more welcome visitor,”<br>said Bilíbin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. “Franz, put the<br>prince’s things in my bedroom,” said he to the servant who was<br>ushering Bolkónski in. “So you’re a messenger of victory, eh?<br>Splendid! And I am sitting here ill, as you see.”<br><br>After washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomat’s<br>luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him. Bilíbin<br>settled down comfortably beside the fire.<br><br>After his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of<br>all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life, Prince<br>Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such<br>as he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides it was pleasant,<br>after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not in Russian<br>(for they were speaking French) at least with a Russian who would, he<br>supposed, share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was<br>then particularly strong.<br><br>Bilíbin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle as<br>Prince Andrew. They had known each other previously in Petersburg, but<br>had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with Kutúzov.<br>Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high<br>in the military profession, so to an even greater extent Bilíbin gave<br>promise of rising in his diplomatic career. He was still a young man but<br>no longer a young diplomat, as he had entered the service at the age<br>of sixteen, had been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather<br>important post in Vienna. Both the foreign minister and our ambassador<br>in Vienna knew him and valued him. He was not one of those many<br>diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities,<br>avoid doing certain things, and speak French. He was one of those,<br>who, liking work, knew how to do it, and despite his indolence would<br>sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table. He worked well<br>whatever the import of his work. It was not the question “What for?”<br>but the question “How?” that interested him. What the diplomatic<br>matter might be he did not care, but it gave him great pleasure to<br>prepare a circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully, pointedly, and<br>elegantly. Bilíbin’s services were valued not only for what he wrote,<br>but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the<br>highest spheres.<br><br>Bilíbin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it could be<br>made elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to say<br>something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was<br>possible. His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original,<br>finished phrases of general interest. These sayings were prepared in the<br>inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so<br>that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to<br>drawing room. And, in fact, Bilíbin’s witticisms were hawked about<br>in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters<br>considered important.<br><br>His thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, which always<br>looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one’s fingers after a<br>Russian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play<br>of expression on his face. Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds<br>and his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and<br>deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always<br>twinkled and looked out straight.<br><br>“Well, now tell me about your exploits,” said he.<br><br>Bolkónski, very modestly without once mentioning himself, described the<br>engagement and his reception by the Minister of War.<br><br>“They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of<br>skittles,” said he in conclusion.<br><br>Bilíbin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.<br><br>“Cependant, mon cher,” he remarked, examining his nails from a<br>distance and puckering the skin above his left eye, “malgré la haute<br>estime que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army, j’avoue que<br>votre victoire n’est pas des plus victorieuses.” *<br><br>     * “But my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox<br>     Russian army, I must say that your victory was not<br>     particularly victorious.”<br><br><br>He went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in<br>Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.<br><br>“Come now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier<br>and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your fingers!<br>Where’s the victory?”<br><br>“But seriously,” said Prince Andrew, “we can at any rate say<br>without boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm...”<br><br>“Why didn’t you capture one, just one, marshal for us?”<br><br>“Because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness<br>of a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get at their rear by<br>seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon.”<br><br>“And why didn’t you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have<br>been there at seven in the morning,” returned Bilíbin with a smile.<br>“You ought to have been there at seven in the morning.”<br><br>“Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic<br>methods that he had better leave Genoa alone?” retorted Prince Andrew<br>in the same tone.<br><br>“I know,” interrupted Bilíbin, “you’re thinking it’s very<br>easy to take marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but<br>still why didn’t you capture him? So don’t be surprised if not only<br>the Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and<br>King Francis is not much delighted by your victory. Even I, a poor<br>secretary of the Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of my<br>joy to give my Franz a thaler, or let him go with his Liebchen to the<br>Prater... True, we have no Prater here...”<br><br>He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his<br>forehead.<br><br>“It is now my turn to ask you ‘why?’ mon cher,” said Bolkónski.<br>“I confess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic<br>subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence, but I can’t make it<br>out. Mack loses a whole army, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke<br>Karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder. Kutúzov<br>alone at last gains a real victory, destroying the spell of the<br>invincibility of the French, and the Minister of War does not even care<br>to hear the details.”<br><br>“That’s just it, my dear fellow. You see it’s hurrah for the Tsar,<br>for Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but<br>what do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring<br>us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one<br>archduke’s as good as another, as you know) and even if it is only<br>over a fire brigade of Bonaparte’s, that will be another story and<br>we’ll fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done<br>on purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke<br>Ferdinand disgraces himself. You abandon Vienna, give up its<br>defense—as much as to say: ‘Heaven is with us, but heaven help you<br>and your capital!’ The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you<br>expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit<br>that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived.<br>It’s as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose<br>you did gain a brilliant victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a<br>victory, what effect would that have on the general course of events?<br>It’s too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French army!”<br><br>“What? Occupied? Vienna occupied?”<br><br>“Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Schönbrunn, and the count,<br>our dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders.”<br><br>After the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, and<br>especially after having dined, Bolkónski felt that he could not take in<br>the full significance of the words he heard.<br><br>“Count Lichtenfels was here this morning,” Bilíbin continued,<br>“and showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna<br>was fully described: Prince Murat et tout le tremblement... You see that<br>your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can’t be<br>received as a savior.”<br><br>“Really I don’t care about that, I don’t care at all,” said<br>Prince Andrew, beginning to understand that his news of the battle<br>before Krems was really of small importance in view of such events as<br>the fall of Austria’s capital. “How is it Vienna was taken? What of<br>the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard<br>reports that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna?” he said.<br><br>“Prince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is<br>defending us—doing it very badly, I think, but still he is defending<br>us. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has not yet been<br>taken and I hope it will not be, for it is mined and orders have been<br>given to blow it up. Otherwise we should long ago have been in the<br>mountains of Bohemia, and you and your army would have spent a bad<br>quarter of an hour between two fires.”<br><br>“But still this does not mean that the campaign is over,” said<br>Prince Andrew.<br><br>“Well, I think it is. The bigwigs here think so too, but they<br>daren’t say so. It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign,<br>it won’t be your skirmishing at Dürrenstein, or gunpowder at all,<br>that will decide the matter, but those who devised it,” said Bilíbin<br>quoting one of his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and<br>pausing. “The only question is what will come of the meeting between<br>the Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia<br>joins the Allies, Austria’s hand will be forced and there will be war.<br>If not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of<br>the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up.”<br><br>“What an extraordinary genius!” Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed,<br>clenching his small hand and striking the table with it, “and what<br>luck the man has!”<br><br>“Buonaparte?” said Bilíbin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead<br>to indicate that he was about to say something witty. “Buonaparte?”<br>he repeated, accentuating the u: “I think, however, now that he lays<br>down laws for Austria at Schönbrunn, il faut lui faire grâce de<br>l’u! * I shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply<br>Bonaparte!”<br><br>    * “We must let him off the u!”<br><br><br>“But joking apart,” said Prince Andrew, “do you really think the<br>campaign is over?”<br><br>“This is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, and she is<br>not used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the<br>first place because her provinces have been pillaged—they say the Holy<br>Russian army loots terribly—her army is destroyed, her capital<br>taken, and all this for the beaux yeux * of His Sardinian Majesty. And<br>therefore—this is between ourselves—I instinctively feel that we<br>are being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France and<br>projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately.”<br><br>    * Fine eyes.<br><br>“Impossible!” cried Prince Andrew. “That would be too base.”<br><br>“If we live we shall see,” replied Bilíbin, his face again becoming<br>smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end.<br><br>When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a<br>clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows, he<br>felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far<br>away from him. The alliance with Prussia, Austria’s treachery,<br>Bonaparte’s new triumph, tomorrow’s levee and parade, and the<br>audience with the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts.<br><br>He closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of musketry<br>and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears, and now<br>again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill,<br>the French were firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode<br>forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around,<br>and he experienced tenfold the joy of living, as he had not done since<br>childhood.<br><br>He woke up...<br><br>“Yes, that all happened!” he said, and, smiling happily to himself<br>like a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>Next day he woke late. Recalling his recent impressions, the first<br>thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented<br>to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War, the polite<br>Austrian adjutant, Bilíbin, and last night’s conversation. Having<br>dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he<br>had not worn for a long time, he went into Bilíbin’s study fresh,<br>animated, and handsome, with his hand bandaged. In the study were four<br>gentlemen of the diplomatic corps. With Prince Hippolyte Kurágin,<br>who was a secretary to the embassy, Bolkónski was already acquainted.<br>Bilíbin introduced him to the others.<br><br>The gentlemen assembled at Bilíbin’s were young, wealthy, gay society<br>men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which Bilíbin, their<br>leader, called les nôtres. * This set, consisting almost exclusively of<br>diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with<br>war or politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to<br>the official side of the service. These gentlemen received Prince<br>Andrew as one of themselves, an honor they did not extend to many. From<br>politeness and to start conversation, they asked him a few questions<br>about the army and the battle, and then the talk went off into merry<br>jests and gossip.<br><br>    * Ours.<br><br>“But the best of it was,” said one, telling of the misfortune of<br>a fellow diplomat, “that the Chancellor told him flatly that his<br>appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it.<br>Can you fancy the figure he cut?...”<br><br>“But the worst of it, gentlemen—I am giving Kurágin away to<br>you—is that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is<br>taking advantage of it!”<br><br>Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its<br>arm. He began to laugh.<br><br>“Tell me about that!” he said.<br><br>“Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!” cried several voices.<br><br>“You, Bolkónski, don’t know,” said Bilíbin turning to Prince<br>Andrew, “that all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of<br>the Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing<br>among the women!”<br><br>“La femme est la compagne de l’homme,” * announced Prince<br>Hippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs.<br><br>    * “Woman is man’s companion.”<br><br><br>Bilíbin and the rest of “ours” burst out laughing in Hippolyte’s<br>face, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whom—he had to<br>admit—he had almost been jealous on his wife’s account, was the butt<br>of this set.<br><br>“Oh, I must give you a treat,” Bilíbin whispered to Bolkónski.<br>“Kurágin is exquisite when he discusses politics—you should see his<br>gravity!”<br><br>He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking<br>to him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these<br>two.<br><br>“The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance,” began<br>Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, “without<br>expressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, unless<br>His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance...<br><br>“Wait, I have not finished...” he said to Prince Andrew, seizing<br>him by the arm, “I believe that intervention will be stronger than<br>nonintervention. And...” he paused. “Finally one cannot impute the<br>nonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18. That is how it will end.”<br>And he released Bolkónski’s arm to indicate that he had now quite<br>finished.<br><br>“Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden<br>mouth!” said Bilíbin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with<br>satisfaction.<br><br>Everybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was evidently<br>distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild<br>laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.<br><br>“Well now, gentlemen,” said Bilíbin, “Bolkónski is my guest in<br>this house and in Brünn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I<br>can, with all the pleasures of life here. If we were in Vienna it would<br>be easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult,<br>and I beg you all to help me. Brünn’s attractions must be shown him.<br>You can undertake the theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course<br>the women.”<br><br>“We must let him see Amelie, she’s exquisite!” said one of<br>“ours,” kissing his finger tips.<br><br>“In general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane<br>interests,” said Bilíbin.<br><br>“I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality,<br>gentlemen, it is already time for me to go,” replied Prince Andrew<br>looking at his watch.<br><br>“Where to?”<br><br>“To the Emperor.”<br><br>“Oh! Oh! Oh!”<br><br>“Well, au revoir, Bolkónski! Au revoir, Prince! Come back early to<br>dinner,” cried several voices. “We’ll take you in hand.”<br><br>“When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way<br>that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,” said Bilíbin,<br>accompanying him to the hall.<br><br>“I should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts,<br>I can’t,” replied Bolkónski, smiling.<br><br>“Well, talk as much as you can, anyway. He has a passion for giving<br>audiences, but he does not like talking himself and can’t do it, as<br>you will see.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had<br>been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his<br>face and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it was<br>over, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed<br>Bolkónski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The Emperor<br>Francis received him standing in the middle of the room. Before the<br>conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor<br>seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say.<br><br>“Tell me, when did the battle begin?” he asked hurriedly.<br><br>Prince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as simple:<br>“Was Kutúzov well? When had he left Krems?” and so on. The Emperor<br>spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions—the<br>answers to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest<br>him.<br><br>“At what o’clock did the battle begin?” asked the Emperor.<br><br>“I cannot inform Your Majesty at what o’clock the battle began at<br>the front, but at Dürrenstein, where I was, our attack began after<br>five in the afternoon,” replied Bolkónski growing more animated and<br>expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account, which<br>he had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the Emperor<br>smiled and interrupted him.<br><br>“How many miles?”<br><br>“From where to where, Your Majesty?”<br><br>“From Dürrenstein to Krems.”<br><br>“Three and a half miles, Your Majesty.”<br><br>“The French have abandoned the left bank?”<br><br>“According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the<br>night.”<br><br>“Is there sufficient forage in Krems?”<br><br>“Forage has not been supplied to the extent...”<br><br>The Emperor interrupted him.<br><br>“At what o’clock was General Schmidt killed?”<br><br>“At seven o’clock, I believe.”<br><br>“At seven o’clock? It’s very sad, very sad!”<br><br>The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew withdrew and<br>was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he<br>saw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterday’s adjutant<br>reproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered him<br>his own house. The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the<br>Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was conferring<br>on him. The Empress’ chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty. The<br>archduchess also wished to see him. He did not know whom to answer, and<br>for a few seconds collected his thoughts. Then the Russian ambassador<br>took him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to<br>him.<br><br>Contrary to Bilíbin’s forecast the news he had brought was joyfully<br>received. A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kutúzov was awarded<br>the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards.<br>Bolkónski was invited everywhere, and had to spend the whole morning<br>calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries. Between four and five<br>in the afternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to<br>Bilíbin’s house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle<br>and his visit to Brünn. At the door he found a vehicle half full of<br>luggage. Franz, Bilíbin’s man, was dragging a portmanteau with some<br>difficulty out of the front door.<br><br>Before returning to Bilíbin’s Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop<br>to provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some<br>time in the shop.<br><br>“What is it?” he asked.<br><br>“Oh, your excellency!” said Franz, with difficulty rolling the<br>portmanteau into the vehicle, “we are to move on still farther. The<br>scoundrel is again at our heels!”<br><br>“Eh? What?” asked Prince Andrew.<br><br>Bilíbin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed excitement.<br><br>“There now! Confess that this is delightful,” said he. “This<br>affair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without<br>striking a blow!”<br><br>Prince Andrew could not understand.<br><br>“But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the<br>town knows?”<br><br>“I come from the archduchess’. I heard nothing there.”<br><br>“And you didn’t see that everybody is packing up?”<br><br>“I did not... What is it all about?” inquired Prince Andrew<br>impatiently.<br><br>“What’s it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that<br>Auersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat<br>is now rushing along the road to Brünn and will be here in a day or<br>two.”<br><br>“What? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was<br>mined?”<br><br>“That is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.”<br><br>Bolkónski shrugged his shoulders.<br><br>“But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It<br>will be cut off,” said he.<br><br>“That’s just it,” answered Bilíbin. “Listen! The French entered<br>Vienna as I told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday, those<br>gentlemen, messieurs les maréchaux, * Murat, Lannes, and Belliard,<br>mount and ride to the bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.)<br>‘Gentlemen,’ says one of them, ‘you know the Thabor Bridge is<br>mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its<br>head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up<br>the bridge and not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign the<br>Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and take<br>it!’ ‘Yes, let’s!’ say the others. And off they go and take the<br>bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of the<br>Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication.”<br><br>    * The marshalls.<br><br>“Stop jesting,” said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news<br>grieved him and yet he was pleased.<br><br>As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless<br>situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it<br>out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from<br>the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame!<br>Listening to Bilíbin he was already imagining how on reaching the army<br>he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one<br>that could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the<br>executing of the plan.<br><br>“Stop this jesting,” he said.<br><br>“I am not jesting,” Bilíbin went on. “Nothing is truer or sadder.<br>These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs;<br>they assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on<br>their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter the<br>tête-de-pont. * They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that<br>the war is over, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with<br>Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The<br>officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack<br>jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to<br>the bridge unobserved, flings the bags of incendiary material into<br>the water, and approaches the tête-de-pont. At length appears the<br>lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself.<br>‘Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars!<br>Hostilities are ended, we can shake one another’s hand.... The<br>Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auersperg’s<br>acquaintance.’ In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so<br>bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly<br>established intimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the<br>sight of Murat’s mantle and ostrich plumes, qu’il n’y voit que du<br>feu, et oublie celui qu’il devait faire faire sur l’ennemi!” *(2)<br>In spite of the animation of his speech, Bilíbin did not forget to<br>pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation. “The<br>French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the<br>bridge is taken! But what is best of all,” he went on, his excitement<br>subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, “is that the<br>sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire<br>the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French<br>troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes<br>stayed his hand. The sergeant, who was evidently wiser than his general,<br>goes up to Auersperg and says: ‘Prince, you are being deceived, here<br>are the French!’ Murat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is<br>allowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a<br>true Gascon) and says: ‘I don’t recognize the world-famous Austrian<br>discipline, if you allow a subordinate to address you like that!’ It<br>was a stroke of genius. Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and<br>orders the sergeant to be arrested. Come, you must own that this affair<br>of the Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor<br>rascality....”<br><br>     * Bridgehead.<br><br>     * (2) That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that<br>     he ought to be firing at the enemy.<br><br>“It may be treachery,” said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the<br>gray overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing,<br>and the glory that awaited him.<br><br>“Not that either. That puts the court in too bad a light,” replied<br>Bilíbin. “It’s not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is<br>just as at Ulm... it is...”—he seemed to be trying to find the right<br>expression. “C’est... c’est du Mack. Nous sommes mackés (It is...<br>it is a bit of Mack. We are Macked),” he concluded, feeling that he<br>had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His<br>hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a<br>slight smile he began to examine his nails.<br><br>“Where are you off to?” he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had<br>risen and was going toward his room.<br><br>“I am going away.”<br><br>“Where to?”<br><br>“To the army.”<br><br>“But you meant to stay another two days?”<br><br>“But now I am off at once.”<br><br>And Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to<br>his room.<br><br>“Do you know, mon cher,” said Bilíbin following him, “I have been<br>thinking about you. Why are you going?”<br><br>And in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles<br>vanished from his face.<br><br>Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.<br><br>“Why are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to<br>the army now that it is in danger. I understand that. Mon cher, it is<br>heroism!”<br><br>“Not at all,” said Prince Andrew.<br><br>“But as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other<br>side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary,<br>is to take care of yourself. Leave it to those who are no longer fit for<br>anything else.... You have not been ordered to return and have not been<br>dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and go with us wherever our<br>ill luck takes us. They say we are going to Olmütz, and Olmütz is a<br>very decent town. You and I will travel comfortably in my calèche.”<br><br>“Do stop joking, Bilíbin,” cried Bolkónski.<br><br>“I am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are<br>you going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two<br>things,” and the skin over his left temple puckered, “either you<br>will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will<br>share defeat and disgrace with Kutúzov’s whole army.”<br><br>And Bilíbin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was<br>insoluble.<br><br>“I cannot argue about it,” replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he<br>thought: “I am going to save the army.”<br><br>“My dear fellow, you are a hero!” said Bilíbin.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>That same night, having taken leave of the Minister of War, Bolkónski<br>set off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he would find it and<br>fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems.<br><br>In Brünn everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the heavy<br>baggage was already being dispatched to Olmütz. Near Hetzelsdorf Prince<br>Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with<br>great haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was so obstructed<br>with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage. Prince Andrew<br>took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and<br>weary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the<br>commander in chief and of his own luggage. Very sinister reports of the<br>position of the army reached him as he went along, and the appearance of<br>the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.<br><br>“Cette armée russe que l’or de l’Angleterre a transportée des<br>extrémités de l’univers, nous allons lui faire éprouver le même<br>sort—(le sort de l’armée d’Ulm).” * He remembered these words<br>in Bonaparte’s address to his army at the beginning of the campaign,<br>and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling<br>of wounded pride, and a hope of glory. “And should there be nothing<br>left but to die?” he thought. “Well, if need be, I shall do it no<br>worse than others.”<br><br>     * “That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of<br>     the earth by English gold, we shall cause to share the same<br>     fate—(the fate of the army at Ulm).”<br><br><br>He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments,<br>carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all<br>kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and<br>sometimes four abreast. From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear<br>could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts<br>and gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the<br>urging of horses, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers.<br>All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some<br>flayed, some not, and broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers<br>sat waiting for something, and again soldiers straggling from their<br>companies, crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages, or<br>returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At<br>each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the<br>din of shouting more incessant. Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud<br>pushed the guns and wagons themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped,<br>traces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting. The officers<br>directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts. Their<br>voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces<br>that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder.<br><br>“Here is our dear Orthodox Russian army,” thought Bolkónski,<br>recalling Bilíbin’s words.<br><br>Wishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to<br>a convoy. Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle,<br>evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and<br>looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a calèche.<br>A soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the<br>apron under the leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up<br>and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention<br>was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An<br>officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving<br>the woman’s vehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes<br>of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage. The woman screamed<br>piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron<br>and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried:<br><br>“Mr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heaven’s sake... Protect<br>me! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh<br>Chasseurs.... They won’t let us pass, we are left behind and have lost<br>our people...”<br><br>“I’ll flatten you into a pancake!” shouted the angry officer to<br>the soldier. “Turn back with your slut!”<br><br>“Mr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?” screamed the<br>doctor’s wife.<br><br>“Kindly let this cart pass. Don’t you see it’s a woman?” said<br>Prince Andrew riding up to the officer.<br><br>The officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the<br>soldier. “I’ll teach you to push on!... Back!”<br><br>“Let them pass, I tell you!” repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his<br>lips.<br><br>“And who are you?” cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy<br>rage, “who are you? Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander here,<br>not you! Go back or I’ll flatten you into a pancake,” repeated he.<br>This expression evidently pleased him.<br><br>“That was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp,” came a voice<br>from behind.<br><br>Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless,<br>tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying. He saw that his<br>championship of the doctor’s wife in her queer trap might expose him<br>to what he dreaded more than anything in the world—to ridicule; but<br>his instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence<br>Prince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised<br>his riding whip.<br><br>“Kind...ly let—them—pass!”<br><br>The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.<br><br>“It’s all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there’s<br>this disorder,” he muttered. “Do as you like.”<br><br>Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the<br>doctor’s wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with<br>a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he<br>galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief<br>was.<br><br>On reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house,<br>intending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to sort<br>out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind. “This<br>is a mob of scoundrels and not an army,” he was thinking as he went<br>up to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called him by<br>name.<br><br>He turned round. Nesvítski’s handsome face looked out of the little<br>window. Nesvítski, moving his moist lips as he chewed something, and<br>flourishing his arm, called him to enter.<br><br>“Bolkónski! Bolkónski!... Don’t you hear? Eh? Come quick...” he<br>shouted.<br><br>Entering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesvítski and another adjutant<br>having something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he<br>had any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm.<br>This was particularly noticeable on Nesvítski’s usually laughing<br>countenance.<br><br>“Where is the commander in chief?” asked Bolkónski.<br><br>“Here, in that house,” answered the adjutant.<br><br>“Well, is it true that it’s peace and capitulation?” asked<br>Nesvítski.<br><br>“I was going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I could<br>do to get here.”<br><br>“And we, my dear boy! It’s terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack,<br>we’re getting it still worse,” said Nesvítski. “But sit down and<br>have something to eat.”<br><br>“You won’t be able to find either your baggage or anything else now,<br>Prince. And God only knows where your man Peter is,” said the other<br>adjutant.<br><br>“Where are headquarters?”<br><br>“We are to spend the night in Znaim.”<br><br>“Well, I have got all I need into packs for two horses,” said<br>Nesvítski. “They’ve made up splendid packs for me—fit to cross<br>the Bohemian mountains with. It’s a bad lookout, old fellow! But<br>what’s the matter with you? You must be ill to shiver like that,” he<br>added, noticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock.<br><br>“It’s nothing,” replied Prince Andrew.<br><br>He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor’s wife and<br>the convoy officer.<br><br>“What is the commander in chief doing here?” he asked.<br><br>“I can’t make out at all,” said Nesvítski.<br><br>“Well, all I can make out is that everything is abominable,<br>abominable, quite abominable!” said Prince Andrew, and he went off to<br>the house where the commander in chief was.<br><br>Passing by Kutúzov’s carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of<br>his suite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince<br>Andrew entered the passage. Kutúzov himself, he was told, was in the<br>house with Prince Bagratión and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Austrian<br>general who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little Kozlóvski was<br>squatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned<br>up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards. Kozlóvski’s<br>face looked worn—he too had evidently not slept all night. He glanced<br>at Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him.<br><br>“Second line... have you written it?” he continued dictating to the<br>clerk. “The Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian...”<br><br>“One can’t write so fast, your honor,” said the clerk, glancing<br>angrily and disrespectfully at Kozlóvski.<br><br>Through the door came the sounds of Kutúzov’s voice, excited and<br>dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the<br>sound of these voices, the inattentive way Kozlóvski looked at him, the<br>disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and<br>Kozlóvski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander<br>in chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the<br>horses near the window, Prince Andrew felt that something important and<br>disastrous was about to happen.<br><br>He turned to Kozlóvski with urgent questions.<br><br>“Immediately, Prince,” said Kozlóvski. “Dispositions for<br>Bagratión.”<br><br>“What about capitulation?”<br><br>“Nothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle.”<br><br>Prince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard.<br>Just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened, and<br>Kutúzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway.<br>Prince Andrew stood right in front of Kutúzov but the expression of<br>the commander in chief’s one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied<br>with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. He<br>looked straight at his adjutant’s face without recognizing him.<br><br>“Well, have you finished?” said he to Kozlóvski.<br><br>“One moment, your excellency.”<br><br>Bagratión, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm,<br>impassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief.<br><br>“I have the honor to present myself,” repeated Prince Andrew rather<br>loudly, handing Kutúzov an envelope.<br><br>“Ah, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later!”<br><br>Kutúzov went out into the porch with Bagratión.<br><br>“Well, good-by, Prince,” said he to Bagratión. “My blessing, and<br>may Christ be with you in your great endeavor!”<br><br>His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his left<br>hand he drew Bagratión toward him, and with his right, on which he wore<br>a ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently<br>habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but Bagratión kissed him on the<br>neck instead.<br><br>“Christ be with you!” Kutúzov repeated and went toward his<br>carriage. “Get in with me,” said he to Bolkónski.<br><br>“Your excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to remain<br>with Prince Bagratión’s detachment.”<br><br>“Get in,” said Kutúzov, and noticing that Bolkónski still delayed,<br>he added: “I need good officers myself, need them myself!”<br><br>They got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.<br><br>“There is still much, much before us,” he said, as if with an old<br>man’s penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolkónski’s<br>mind. “If a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,”<br>he added as if speaking to himself.<br><br>Prince Andrew glanced at Kutúzov’s face only a foot distant from him<br>and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near<br>his temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty<br>eye socket. “Yes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those men’s<br>death,” thought Bolkónski.<br><br>“That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment,” he said.<br><br>Kutúzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had been<br>saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently swaying<br>on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew.<br>There was not a trace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he<br>questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the<br>Emperor, about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems<br>affair, and about some ladies they both knew.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>On November 1 Kutúzov had received, through a spy, news that the army<br>he commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported that<br>the French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in<br>immense force upon Kutúzov’s line of communication with the troops<br>that were arriving from Russia. If Kutúzov decided to remain at Krems,<br>Napoleon’s army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him<br>off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he<br>would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If Kutúzov decided<br>to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia,<br>he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian<br>mountains, defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and<br>abandoning all hope of a junction with Buxhöwden. If Kutúzov decided<br>to retreat along the road from Krems to Olmütz, to unite with the<br>troops arriving from Russia, he risked being forestalled on that road<br>by the French who had crossed the Vienna bridge, and encumbered by his<br>baggage and transport, having to accept battle on the march against an<br>enemy three times as strong, who would hem him in from two sides.<br><br>Kutúzov chose this latter course.<br><br>The French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were<br>advancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles<br>off on the line of Kutúzov’s retreat. If he reached Znaim before the<br>French, there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the<br>French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a<br>disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction. But to forestall<br>the French with his whole army was impossible. The road for the French<br>from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the<br>Russians from Krems to Znaim.<br><br>The night he received the news, Kutúzov sent Bagratión’s vanguard,<br>four thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim<br>to the Vienna-Znaim road. Bagratión was to make this march without<br>resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he<br>succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as<br>possible. Kutúzov himself with all his transport took the road to<br>Znaim.<br><br>Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his<br>hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers<br>by the way, Bagratión came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabrünn<br>a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrünn from<br>Vienna. Kutúzov with his transport had still to march for some days<br>before he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagratión with his four thousand<br>hungry, exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army<br>that came upon him at Hollabrünn, which was clearly impossible. But<br>a freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trick<br>that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without<br>a fight led Murat to try to deceive Kutúzov in a similar way. Meeting<br>Bagratión’s weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be<br>Kutúzov’s whole army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited<br>the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna,<br>and with this object offered a three days’ truce on condition that<br>both armies should remain in position without moving. Murat declared<br>that negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he<br>therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count<br>Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed<br>Murat’s emissary and retired, leaving Bagratión’s division<br>exposed. Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace<br>negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days’ truce.<br>Bagratión replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse<br>a truce and sent his adjutant to Kutúzov to report the offer he had<br>received.<br><br>A truce was Kutúzov’s sole chance of gaining time, giving<br>Bagratión’s exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and<br>heavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French) advance<br>if but one stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the only, and<br>a quite unexpected, chance of saving the army. On receiving the news<br>he immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in<br>attendance on him, to the enemy camp. Wintzingerode was not merely<br>to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation, and<br>meanwhile Kutúzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the<br>movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim<br>road. Bagratión’s exhausted and hungry detachment, which alone<br>covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army, had to<br>remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself.<br><br>Kutúzov’s expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were<br>in no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to pass,<br>and also that Murat’s mistake would very soon be discovered, proved<br>correct. As soon as Bonaparte (who was at Schönbrunn, sixteen miles<br>from Hollabrünn) received Murat’s dispatch with the proposal of a<br>truce and a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the following<br>letter to Murat:<br><br>Schönbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,<br><br>at eight o’clock in the morning<br><br>To PRINCE MURAT,<br><br>I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command only<br>my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my<br>order. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Break<br>the armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the<br>general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no<br>one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.<br><br>If, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will<br>ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian<br>army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.<br><br>The Russian Emperor’s aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are<br>nothing when they have no powers; this one had none.... The Austrians<br>let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge, you are<br>letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor.<br><br>NAPOLEON<br><br>Bonaparte’s adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to<br>Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all<br>the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim<br>escape, and Bagratión’s four thousand men merrily lighted campfires,<br>dried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first time<br>for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store<br>for him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>Between three and four o’clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who<br>had persisted in his request to Kutúzov, arrived at Grunth and reported<br>himself to Bagratión. Bonaparte’s adjutant had not yet reached<br>Murat’s detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In Bagratión’s<br>detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs. They<br>talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility; others talked<br>of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement.<br>Bagratión, knowing Bolkónski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant,<br>received him with distinction and special marks of favor, explaining to<br>him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next, and<br>giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join<br>the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat, “which is also<br>very important.”<br><br>“However, there will hardly be an engagement today,” said Bagratión<br>as if to reassure Prince Andrew.<br><br>“If he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a<br>medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he<br>wishes to stay with me, let him... he’ll be of use here if he’s a<br>brave officer,” thought Bagratión. Prince Andrew, without replying,<br>asked the prince’s permission to ride round the position to see the<br>disposition of the forces, so as to know his bearings should he be sent<br>to execute an order. The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed<br>man with a diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of speaking<br>French though he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince Andrew.<br><br>On all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who<br>seemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches,<br>and fencing from the village.<br><br>“There now, Prince! We can’t stop those fellows,” said the staff<br>officer pointing to the soldiers. “The officers don’t keep them in<br>hand. And there,” he pointed to a sutler’s tent, “they crowd in<br>and sit. This morning I turned them all out and now look, it’s full<br>again. I must go there, Prince, and scare them a bit. It won’t take a<br>moment.”<br><br>“Yes, let’s go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese,”<br>said Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.<br><br>“Why didn’t you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you<br>something.”<br><br>They dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed and<br>weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.<br><br>“Now what does this mean, gentlemen?” said the staff officer, in<br>the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more<br>than once. “You know it won’t do to leave your posts like this.<br>The prince gave orders that no one should leave his post. Now you,<br>Captain,” and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who<br>without his boots (he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry),<br>in only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not altogether<br>comfortably.<br><br>“Well, aren’t you ashamed of yourself, Captain Túshin?” he<br>continued. “One would think that as an artillery officer you would set<br>a good example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be<br>sounded and you’ll be in a pretty position without your boots!” (The<br>staff officer smiled.) “Kindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of<br>you, all!” he added in a tone of command.<br><br>Prince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer<br>Túshin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to<br>the other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, kindly eyes<br>from Prince Andrew to the staff officer.<br><br>“The soldiers say it feels easier without boots,” said Captain<br>Túshin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently wishing<br>to adopt a jocular tone. But before he had finished he felt that his<br>jest was unacceptable and had not come off. He grew confused.<br><br>“Kindly return to your posts,” said the staff officer trying to<br>preserve his gravity.<br><br>Prince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer’s small figure.<br>There was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic,<br>but extremely attractive.<br><br>The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on.<br><br>Having ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking<br>soldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left some<br>entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which showed up<br>red. Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt sleeves despite<br>the cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants;<br>spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the<br>bank by unseen hands. Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at<br>the entrenchment, and went on again. Just behind it they came upon some<br>dozens of soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the<br>entrenchment. They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a<br>trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines.<br><br>“Voilà l’agrément des camps, monsieur le prince,” * said the<br>staff officer.<br><br>    * “This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince.”<br><br><br>They rode up the opposite hill. From there the French could already be<br>seen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position.<br><br>“That’s our battery,” said the staff officer indicating the<br>highest point. “It’s in charge of the queer fellow we saw without<br>his boots. You can see everything from there; let’s go there,<br>Prince.”<br><br>“Thank you very much, I will go on alone,” said Prince Andrew,<br>wishing to rid himself of this staff officer’s company, “please<br>don’t trouble yourself further.”<br><br>The staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.<br><br>The farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and<br>cheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and depression had been<br>in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven<br>miles away from the French. At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm<br>could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the<br>more confident was the appearance of our troops. The soldiers in<br>their greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company<br>officers were counting the men, poking the last man in each section in<br>the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered over<br>the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building<br>shelters with merry chatter and laughter; around the fires sat others,<br>dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending<br>boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers.<br>In one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly<br>at the steaming boiler, waiting till the sample, which a quartermaster<br>sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log<br>before his shelter, had been tasted.<br><br>Another company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka,<br>crowded round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who, tilting<br>a keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him. The<br>soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces,<br>emptied them, rolling the vodka in their mouths, and walked away from<br>the sergeant major with brightened expressions, licking their lips and<br>wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats. All their faces were<br>as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful<br>encampment, and not within sight of the enemy before an action in<br>which at least half of them would be left on the field. After passing a<br>chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev grenadiers—fine fellows<br>busy with similar peaceful affairs—near the shelter of the regimental<br>commander, higher than and different from the others, Prince Andrew came<br>out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man. Two<br>soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and<br>striking him regularly on his bare back. The man shrieked unnaturally.<br>A stout major was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the<br>screams kept repeating:<br><br>“It’s a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must be honest,<br>honorable, and brave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in<br>him, he’s a scoundrel. Go on! Go on!”<br><br>So the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but unnatural<br>screams, continued.<br><br>“Go on, go on!” said the major.<br><br>A young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face<br>stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant<br>as he rode by.<br><br>Prince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our front<br>line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks,<br>but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that<br>morning, the lines were so near together that the men could see one<br>another’s faces and speak to one another. Besides the soldiers who<br>formed the picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookers<br>who, jesting and laughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies.<br><br>Since early morning—despite an injunction not to approach the picket<br>line—the officers had been unable to keep sight-seers away. The<br>soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a curiosity,<br>no longer looked at the French but paid attention to the sight-seers and<br>grew weary waiting to be relieved. Prince Andrew halted to have a look<br>at the French.<br><br>“Look! Look there!” one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a<br>Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and<br>was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier. “Hark to him<br>jabbering! Fine, isn’t it? It’s all the Frenchy can do to keep up<br>with him. There now, Sídorov!”<br><br>“Wait a bit and listen. It’s fine!” answered Sídorov, who was<br>considered an adept at French.<br><br>The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dólokhov. Prince Andrew<br>recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying. Dólokhov<br>had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed, with<br>his captain.<br><br>“Now then, go on, go on!” incited the officer, bending forward and<br>trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to<br>him. “More, please: more! What’s he saying?”<br><br>Dólokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot<br>dispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about the<br>campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was<br>trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all<br>the way from Ulm, while Dólokhov maintained that the Russians had not<br>surrendered but had beaten the French.<br><br>“We have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you off,”<br>said Dólokhov.<br><br>“Only take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!” said<br>the French grenadier.<br><br>The French onlookers and listeners laughed.<br><br>“We’ll make you dance as we did under Suvórov...,” * said<br>Dólokhov.<br><br>    * “On vous fera danser.”<br><br><br>“Qu’ est-ce qu’il chante?” * asked a Frenchman.<br><br>    * “What’s he singing about?”<br><br><br>“It’s ancient history,” said another, guessing that it referred to<br>a former war. “The Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the<br>others...”<br><br>“Bonaparte...” began Dólokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him.<br><br>“Not Bonaparte. He is the Emperor! Sacré nom...!” cried he angrily.<br><br>“The devil skin your Emperor.”<br><br>And Dólokhov swore at him in coarse soldier’s Russian and shouldering<br>his musket walked away.<br><br>“Let us go, Iván Lukích,” he said to the captain.<br><br>“Ah, that’s the way to talk French,” said the picket soldiers.<br>“Now, Sídorov, you have a try!”<br><br>Sídorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber meaningless<br>sounds very fast: “Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, Kaská,” he said,<br>trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice.<br><br>“Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!” came peals of such healthy<br>and good-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French<br>involuntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be<br>to unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as<br>quickly as possible.<br><br>But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and<br>entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon<br>confronted one another as before.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince<br>Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had<br>told him the whole field could be seen. Here he dismounted, and stopped<br>beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon. Before the guns an<br>artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the<br>officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing.<br>Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes<br>and artillerymen’s bonfires. To the left, not far from the farthest<br>cannon, was a small, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the<br>sound of officers’ voices in eager conversation.<br><br>It was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the<br>greater part of the enemy’s opened out from this battery. Just facing<br>it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of Schön Grabern<br>could be seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops<br>amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were<br>evidently in the village itself and behind the hill. To the left from<br>that village, amid the smoke, was something resembling a battery, but it<br>was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye. Our right flank was<br>posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position.<br>Our infantry were stationed there, and at the farthest point the<br>dragoons. In the center, where Túshin’s battery stood and from which<br>Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most<br>direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from Schön<br>Grabern. On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked<br>the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood. The French line was<br>wider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us<br>on both sides. Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, making it<br>difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire. Prince Andrew took<br>out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the<br>position. He made some notes on two points, intending to mention them to<br>Bagratión. His idea was, first, to concentrate all the artillery in the<br>center, and secondly, to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the<br>dip. Prince Andrew, being always near the commander in chief, closely<br>following the mass movements and general orders, and constantly studying<br>historical accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself the<br>course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline. He<br>imagined only important possibilities: “If the enemy attacks the right<br>flank,” he said to himself, “the Kiev grenadiers and the Podólsk<br>chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center<br>come up. In that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank<br>counterattack. If they attack our center we, having the center battery<br>on this high ground, shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and<br>retreat to the dip by echelons.” So he reasoned.... All the time<br>he had been beside the gun, he had heard the voices of the officers<br>distinctly, but as often happens had not understood a word of what they<br>were saying. Suddenly, however, he was struck by a voice coming from the<br>shed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen.<br><br>“No, friend,” said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a<br>familiar voice, “what I say is that if it were possible to know<br>what is beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it. That’s so,<br>friend.”<br><br>Another, a younger voice, interrupted him: “Afraid or not, you can’t<br>escape it anyhow.”<br><br>“All the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people,” said a third<br>manly voice interrupting them both. “Of course you artillery men are<br>very wise, because you can take everything along with you—vodka and<br>snacks.”<br><br>And the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer,<br>laughed.<br><br>“Yes, one is afraid,” continued the first speaker, he of the<br>familiar voice. “One is afraid of the unknown, that’s what it is.<br>Whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky... we know there is<br>no sky but only an atmosphere.”<br><br>The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.<br><br>“Well, stand us some of your herb vodka, Túshin,” it said.<br><br>“Why,” thought Prince Andrew, “that’s the captain who stood up<br>in the sutler’s hut without his boots.” He recognized the agreeable,<br>philosophizing voice with pleasure.<br><br>“Some herb vodka? Certainly!” said Túshin. “But still, to<br>conceive a future life...”<br><br>He did not finish. Just then there was a whistle in the air; nearer and<br>nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it<br>had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near<br>the shed with super human force, throwing up a mass of earth. The ground<br>seemed to groan at the terrible impact.<br><br>And immediately Túshin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth<br>and his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed<br>followed by the owner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer who<br>hurried off to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVII<br><br>Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery,<br>looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball. His eyes<br>ran rapidly over the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto<br>motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was<br>a battery to their left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two<br>mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill. A<br>small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill,<br>probably to strengthen the front line. The smoke of the first shot had<br>not yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a report.<br>The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back<br>to Grunth to find Prince Bagratión. He heard the cannonade behind him<br>growing louder and more frequent. Evidently our guns had begun to reply.<br>From the bottom of the slope, where the parleys had taken place, came<br>the report of musketry.<br><br>Lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparte’s stern letter,<br>and Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at once<br>moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian<br>wings, hoping before evening and before the arrival of the Emperor to<br>crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him.<br><br>“It has begun. Here it is!” thought Prince Andrew, feeling the<br>blood rush to his heart. “But where and how will my Toulon present<br>itself?”<br><br>Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking<br>vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same rapid<br>movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready,<br>and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his<br>heart. “It has begun! Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable!” was what<br>the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say.<br><br>Before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up, he saw,<br>in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming toward him.<br>The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a<br>white horse, was Prince Bagratión. Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for<br>him to come up; Prince Bagratión reined in his horse and recognizing<br>Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew<br>told him what he had seen.<br><br>The feeling, “It has begun! Here it is!” was seen even on Prince<br>Bagratión’s hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes.<br>Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face<br>and wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking<br>and feeling at that moment. “Is there anything at all behind that<br>impassive face?” Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked. Prince<br>Bagratión bent his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew<br>told him, and said, “Very good!” in a tone that seemed to imply that<br>everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he<br>had foreseen. Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride, spoke<br>quickly. Prince Bagratión, uttering his words with an Oriental accent,<br>spoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that there was no<br>need to hurry. However, he put his horse to a trot in the direction<br>of Túshin’s battery. Prince Andrew followed with the suite. Behind<br>Prince Bagratión rode an officer of the suite, the prince’s personal<br>adjutant, Zherkóv, an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty,<br>riding a fine bobtailed horse, and a civilian—an accountant who had<br>asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity. The<br>accountant, a stout, full-faced man, looked around him with a naïve<br>smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the<br>hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on<br>his horse with a convoy officer’s saddle.<br><br>“He wants to see a battle,” said Zherkóv to Bolkónski, pointing<br>to the accountant, “but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach<br>already.”<br><br>“Oh, leave off!” said the accountant with a beaming but rather<br>cunning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of Zherkóv’s<br>joke, and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was.<br><br>“It is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince,” said the staff officer.<br>(He remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a<br>prince, but could not get it quite right.)<br><br>By this time they were all approaching Túshin’s battery, and a ball<br>struck the ground in front of them.<br><br>“What’s that that has fallen?” asked the accountant with a naïve<br>smile.<br><br>“A French pancake,” answered Zherkóv.<br><br>“So that’s what they hit with?” asked the accountant. “How<br>awful!”<br><br>He seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly finished speaking<br>when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly<br>ended with a thud into something soft... f-f-flop! and a Cossack, riding<br>a little to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with<br>his horse. Zherkóv and the staff officer bent over their saddles and<br>turned their horses away. The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack,<br>and examined him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but the<br>horse still struggled.<br><br>Prince Bagratión screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing the<br>cause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to say,<br>“Is it worth while noticing trifles?” He reined in his horse with<br>the care of a skillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged his<br>saber which had caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned saber of<br>a kind no longer in general use. Prince Andrew remembered the story of<br>Suvórov giving his saber to Bagratión in Italy, and the recollection<br>was particularly pleasant at that moment. They had reached the battery<br>at which Prince Andrew had been when he examined the battlefield.<br><br>“Whose company?” asked Prince Bagratión of an artilleryman standing<br>by the ammunition wagon.<br><br>He asked, “Whose company?” but he really meant, “Are you<br>frightened here?” and the artilleryman understood him.<br><br>“Captain Túshin’s, your excellency!” shouted the red-haired,<br>freckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.<br><br>“Yes, yes,” muttered Bagratión as if considering something, and he<br>rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon.<br><br>As he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his<br>suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see<br>the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its<br>former position. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number One, holding<br>a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while Number Two with<br>a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon’s mouth. The short,<br>round-shouldered Captain Túshin, stumbling over the tail of the gun<br>carriage, moved forward and, not noticing the general, looked out<br>shading his eyes with his small hand.<br><br>“Lift it two lines more and it will be just right,” cried he in a<br>feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill-suited to<br>his weak figure. “Number Two!” he squeaked. “Fire, Medvédev!”<br><br>Bagratión called to him, and Túshin, raising three fingers to his cap<br>with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute<br>but like a priest’s benediction, approached the general. Though<br>Túshin’s guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was<br>firing incendiary balls at the village of Schön Grabern visible just<br>opposite, in front of which large masses of French were advancing.<br><br>No one had given Túshin orders where and at what to fire, but after<br>consulting his sergeant major, Zakharchénko, for whom he had great<br>respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the<br>village. “Very good!” said Bagratión in reply to the officer’s<br>report, and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended<br>before him. The French had advanced nearest on our right. Below the<br>height on which the Kiev regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the<br>rivulet flowed, the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was<br>heard, and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of<br>the suite pointed out to Bagratión a French column that was outflanking<br>us. To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince<br>Bagratión ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to<br>reinforce the right flank. The officer of the suite ventured to remark<br>to the prince that if these battalions went away, the guns would remain<br>without support. Prince Bagratión turned to the officer and with his<br>dull eyes looked at him in silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew that the<br>officer’s remark was just and that really no answer could be made to<br>it. But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the<br>commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses<br>of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in<br>disorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince Bagratión<br>bowed his head in sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk to<br>the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the<br>French. But this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that<br>the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in<br>the ground, as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing<br>men uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the<br>wood.<br><br>“Very good!” said Bagratión.<br><br>As he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also, and<br>as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there<br>himself, Prince Bagratión sent Zherkóv to tell the general in command<br>(the one who had paraded his regiment before Kutúzov at Braunau) that<br>he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear,<br>as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy’s<br>attack very long. About Túshin and the battalion that had been in<br>support of his battery all was forgotten. Prince Andrew listened<br>attentively to Bagratión’s colloquies with the commanding officers<br>and the orders he gave them and, to his surprise, found that no orders<br>were really given, but that Prince Bagratión tried to make it appear<br>that everything done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of<br>subordinate commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least<br>in accord with his intentions. Prince Andrew noticed, however, that<br>though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the<br>commander’s will, owing to the tact Bagratión showed, his presence<br>was very valuable. Officers who approached him with disturbed<br>countenances became calm; soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew<br>more cheerful in his presence, and were evidently anxious to display<br>their courage before him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>Prince Bagratión, having reached the highest point of our right flank,<br>began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where<br>on account of the smoke nothing could be seen. The nearer they got to<br>the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness<br>of the actual battlefield. They began to meet wounded men. One with a<br>bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who<br>supported him under the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat and he<br>was spitting blood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or<br>mouth. Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket,<br>groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while<br>blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle. He had<br>that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering.<br>Crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men<br>lying on the ground; they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were<br>unwounded. The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and<br>despite the general’s presence were talking loudly and gesticulating.<br>In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the<br>smoke, and an officer catching sight of Bagratión rushed shouting after<br>the crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back. Bagratión rode up<br>to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, drowning<br>the sound of voices and the shouts of command. The whole air reeked with<br>smoke. The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it. Some<br>were using their ramrods, others putting powder on the touchpans or<br>taking charges from their pouches, while others were firing, though who<br>they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no<br>wind to carry away. A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were<br>often heard. “What is this?” thought Prince Andrew approaching the<br>crowd of soldiers. “It can’t be an attack, for they are not moving;<br>it can’t be a square—for they are not drawn up for that.”<br><br>The commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old man with a<br>pleasant smile—his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes,<br>giving him a mild expression, rode up to Bagratión and welcomed him as<br>a host welcomes an honored guest. He reported that his regiment had<br>been attacked by French cavalry and that, though the attack had been<br>repulsed, he had lost more than half his men. He said the attack<br>had been repulsed, employing this military term to describe what had<br>occurred to his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know what<br>had happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him, and<br>could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his<br>regiment had been broken up. All he knew was that at the commencement<br>of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and<br>hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted “Cavalry!” and<br>our men had begun firing. They were still firing, not at the cavalry<br>which had disappeared, but at French infantry who had come into the<br>hollow and were firing at our men. Prince Bagratión bowed his head as a<br>sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected. Turning<br>to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the<br>Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just passed. Prince Andrew was struck by<br>the changed expression on Prince Bagratión’s face at this moment. It<br>expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of<br>a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water.<br>The dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation<br>of profound thought. The round, steady, hawk’s eyes looked before him<br>eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although his<br>movements were still slow and measured.<br><br>The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagratión, entreating<br>him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were.<br>“Please, your excellency, for God’s sake!” he kept saying,<br>glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away<br>from him. “There, you see!” and he drew attention to the bullets<br>whistling, singing, and hissing continually around them. He spoke in the<br>tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who<br>has picked up an ax: “We are used to it, but you, sir, will blister<br>your hands.” He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and his<br>half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words. The staff<br>officer joined in the colonel’s appeals, but Bagratión did not reply;<br>he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to give room<br>for the two approaching battalions. While he was speaking, the curtain<br>of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising wind, began<br>to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand, and the<br>hill opposite, with the French moving about on it, opened out before<br>them. All eyes fastened involuntarily on this French column advancing<br>against them and winding down over the uneven ground. One could already<br>see the soldiers’ shaggy caps, distinguish the officers from the men,<br>and see the standard flapping against its staff.<br><br>“They march splendidly,” remarked someone in Bagratión’s suite.<br><br>The head of the column had already descended into the hollow. The clash<br>would take place on this side of it...<br><br>The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up<br>and moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came<br>two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order. Before they had<br>reached Bagratión, the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in<br>step could be heard. On their left flank, nearest to Bagratión, marched<br>a company commander, a fine round-faced man, with a stupid and happy<br>expression—the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed. At that<br>moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he<br>would appear as he passed the commander.<br><br>With the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with<br>his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full<br>height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy<br>tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried close<br>to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and not like a real<br>weapon) and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men<br>without losing step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as<br>if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander<br>in the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well he<br>was happy. “Left... left... left...” he seemed to repeat to himself<br>at each alternate step; and in time to this, with stern but varied<br>faces, the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched<br>in step, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be<br>repeating to himself at each alternate step, “Left... left...<br>left...” A fat major skirted a bush, puffing and falling out of<br>step; a soldier who had fallen behind, his face showing alarm at his<br>defection, ran at a trot, panting to catch up with his company. A cannon<br>ball, cleaving the air, flew over the heads of Bagratión and his suite,<br>and fell into the column to the measure of “Left... left!” “Close<br>up!” came the company commander’s voice in jaunty tones. The<br>soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had<br>fallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who<br>had stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, falling<br>into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous<br>silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one<br>seemed to hear left... left... left.<br><br>“Well done, lads!” said Prince Bagratión.<br><br>“Glad to do our best, your ex’len-lency!” came a confused shout<br>from the ranks. A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on<br>Bagratión as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: “We<br>know that ourselves!” Another, without looking round, as though<br>fearing to relax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.<br><br>The order was given to halt and down knapsacks.<br><br>Bagratión rode round the ranks that had marched past him and<br>dismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over his<br>felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The head of the<br>French column, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill.<br><br>“Forward, with God!” said Bagratión, in a resolute, sonorous voice,<br>turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms,<br>he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of<br>a cavalryman. Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him<br>forward, and experienced great happiness.<br><br>The French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside Bagratión,<br>could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and even their<br>faces. (He distinctly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered<br>legs and turned-out toes, climbed the hill with difficulty.) Prince<br>Bagratión gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in<br>front of the ranks. Suddenly one shot after another rang out from the<br>French, smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks, and musket shots<br>sounded. Several of our men fell, among them the round-faced officer<br>who had marched so gaily and complacently. But at the moment the first<br>report was heard, Bagratión looked round and shouted, “Hurrah!”<br><br>“Hurrah—ah!—ah!” rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and<br>passing Bagratión and racing one another they rushed in an irregular<br>but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIX<br><br>The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right<br>flank. In the center Túshin’s forgotten battery, which had managed to<br>set fire to the Schön Grabern village, delayed the French advance. The<br>French were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus<br>gave us time to retreat. The retirement of the center to the other side<br>of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but the<br>different companies did not get mixed. But our left—which consisted<br>of the Azóv and Podólsk infantry and the Pávlograd hussars—was<br>simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under<br>Lannes and was thrown into confusion. Bagratión had sent Zherkóv<br>to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat<br>immediately.<br><br>Zherkóv, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about<br>and galloped off. But no sooner had he left Bagratión than his courage<br>failed him. He was seized by panic and could not go where it was<br>dangerous.<br><br>Having reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where the<br>firing was, he began to look for the general and his staff where they<br>could not possibly be, and so did not deliver the order.<br><br>The command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of<br>the regiment Kutúzov had reviewed at Braunau and in which Dólokhov was<br>serving as a private. But the command of the extreme left flank had been<br>assigned to the commander of the Pávlograd regiment in which Rostóv<br>was serving, and a misunderstanding arose. The two commanders were much<br>exasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on<br>the right flank and the French were already advancing, were engaged<br>in discussion with the sole object of offending one another. But the<br>regiments, both cavalry and infantry, were by no means ready for the<br>impending action. From privates to general they were not expecting a<br>battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding the<br>horses and the infantry collecting wood.<br><br>“He higher iss dan I in rank,” said the German colonel of the<br>hussars, flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, “so<br>let him do what he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars... Bugler,<br>sount ze retreat!”<br><br>But haste was becoming imperative. Cannon and musketry, mingling<br>together, thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes<br>of Lannes’ sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and<br>forming up within twice the range of a musket shot. The general in<br>command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and<br>having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the<br>Pávlograd commander. The commanders met with polite bows but with<br>secret malevolence in their hearts.<br><br>“Once again, Colonel,” said the general, “I can’t leave half<br>my men in the wood. I beg of you, I beg of you,” he repeated, “to<br>occupy the position and prepare for an attack.”<br><br>“I peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!”<br>suddenly replied the irate colonel. “If you vere in the cavalry...”<br><br>“I am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a Russian general and if<br>you are not aware of the fact...”<br><br>“Quite avare, your excellency,” suddenly shouted the colonel,<br>touching his horse and turning purple in the face. “Vill you be so<br>goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot? I don’t<br>vish to destroy my men for your pleasure!”<br><br>“You forget yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my own pleasure<br>and I won’t allow it to be said!”<br><br>Taking the colonel’s outburst as a challenge to his courage, the<br>general expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the<br>front line, as if their differences would be settled there amongst the<br>bullets. They reached the front, several bullets sped over them, and<br>they halted in silence. There was nothing fresh to be seen from the<br>line, for from where they had been before it had been evident that it<br>was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground,<br>as well as that the French were outflanking our left. The general<br>and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two<br>fighting cocks preparing for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs<br>of cowardice in the other. Both passed the examination successfully. As<br>there was nothing to be said, and neither wished to give occasion for<br>it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire,<br>they would have remained there for a long time testing each other’s<br>courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry<br>and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood. The French had<br>attacked the men collecting wood in the copse. It was no longer possible<br>for the hussars to retreat with the infantry. They were cut off from<br>the line of retreat on the left by the French. However inconvenient the<br>position, it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through<br>for themselves.<br><br>The squadron in which Rostóv was serving had scarcely time to mount<br>before it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge,<br>there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that<br>terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear—resembling the line<br>separating the living from the dead—lay between them. All were<br>conscious of this unseen line, and the question whether they would cross<br>it or not, and how they would cross it, agitated them all.<br><br>The colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to questions put<br>to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on having<br>his own way, gave an order. No one said anything definite, but the rumor<br>of an attack spread through the squadron. The command to form up rang<br>out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards.<br>Still no one moved. The troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars<br>alike, felt that the commander did not himself know what to do, and this<br>irresolution communicated itself to the men.<br><br>“If only they would be quick!” thought Rostóv, feeling that at last<br>the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so<br>often heard from his fellow hussars.<br><br>“Fo’ward, with God, lads!” rang out Denísov’s voice. “At a<br>twot fo’ward!”<br><br>The horses’ croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at the<br>reins and started of his own accord.<br><br>Before him, on the right, Rostóv saw the front lines of his hussars and<br>still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but<br>took to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, but some way off.<br><br>“Faster!” came the word of command, and Rostóv felt Rook’s flanks<br>drooping as he broke into a gallop.<br><br>Rostóv anticipated his horse’s movements and became more and more<br>elated. He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree had been<br>in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible—and now he<br>had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but<br>everything was becoming more and more happy and animated. “Oh, how I<br>will slash at him!” thought Rostóv, gripping the hilt of his saber.<br><br>“Hur-a-a-a-ah!” came a roar of voices. “Let anyone come my way<br>now,” thought Rostóv driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go<br>at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead, the enemy was<br>already visible. Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep<br>over the squadron. Rostóv raised his saber, ready to strike, but at<br>that instant the trooper Nikítenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away<br>from him, and Rostóv felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried<br>forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From<br>behind him Bondarchúk, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked<br>angrily at him. Bondarchúk’s horse swerved and galloped past.<br><br>“How is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!” Rostóv<br>asked and answered at the same instant. He was alone in the middle of a<br>field. Instead of the moving horses and hussars’ backs, he saw nothing<br>before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him. There<br>was warm blood under his arm. “No, I am wounded and the horse is<br>killed.” Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his<br>rider’s leg. Blood was flowing from his head; he struggled but could<br>not rise. Rostóv also tried to rise but fell back, his sabretache<br>having become entangled in the saddle. Where our men were, and where the<br>French, he did not know. There was no one near.<br><br>Having disentangled his leg, he rose. “Where, on which side, was now<br>the line that had so sharply divided the two armies?” he asked himself<br>and could not answer. “Can something bad have happened to me?”<br>he wondered as he got up: and at that moment he felt that something<br>superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm. The wrist felt as if<br>it were not his. He examined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find<br>blood on it. “Ah, here are people coming,” he thought joyfully,<br>seeing some men running toward him. “They will help me!” In front<br>came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned,<br>and with a hooked nose. Then came two more, and many more running<br>behind. One of them said something strange, not in Russian. In among the<br>hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a Russian hussar. He<br>was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him.<br><br>“It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will<br>take me too? Who are these men?” thought Rostóv, scarcely believing<br>his eyes. “Can they be French?” He looked at the approaching<br>Frenchmen, and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get<br>at them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful<br>that he could not believe his eyes. “Who are they? Why are they<br>running? Can they be coming at me? And why? To kill me? Me whom everyone<br>is so fond of?” He remembered his mother’s love for him, and his<br>family’s, and his friends’, and the enemy’s intention to kill him<br>seemed impossible. “But perhaps they may do it!” For more than ten<br>seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation.<br>The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was already so<br>close that the expression of his face could be seen. And the excited,<br>alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding his breath,<br>and running so lightly, frightened Rostóv. He seized his pistol and,<br>instead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran with all his<br>might toward the bushes. He did not now run with the feeling of doubt<br>and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge, but with the<br>feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One single sentiment, that<br>of fear for his young and happy life, possessed his whole being. Rapidly<br>leaping the furrows, he fled across the field with the impetuosity he<br>used to show at catchplay, now and then turning his good-natured, pale,<br>young face to look back. A shudder of terror went through him: “No,<br>better not look,” he thought, but having reached the bushes he glanced<br>round once more. The French had fallen behind, and just as he looked<br>round the first man changed his run to a walk and, turning, shouted<br>something loudly to a comrade farther back. Rostóv paused. “No,<br>there’s some mistake,” thought he. “They can’t have wanted to<br>kill me.” But at the same time, his left arm felt as heavy as if<br>a seventy-pound weight were tied to it. He could run no more. The<br>Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rostóv closed his eyes and stooped<br>down. One bullet and then another whistled past him. He mustered his<br>last remaining strength, took hold of his left hand with his right, and<br>reached the bushes. Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XX<br><br>The infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts<br>of the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting mixed, and<br>retreated as a disorderly crowd. One soldier, in his fear, uttered the<br>senseless cry, “Cut off!” that is so terrible in battle, and that<br>word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.<br><br>“Surrounded! Cut off? We’re lost!” shouted the fugitives.<br><br>The moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the general<br>realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment, and the<br>thought that he, an exemplary officer of many years’ service who<br>had never been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters<br>for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the<br>recalcitrant cavalry colonel, his own dignity as a general, and above<br>all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self-preservation, he<br>clutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring his horse, galloped to<br>the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around, but fortunately<br>missed him. His one desire was to know what was happening and at any<br>cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he had made one, so that he,<br>an exemplary officer of twenty-two years’ service, who had never been<br>censured, should not be held to blame.<br><br>Having galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind<br>the copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and<br>descending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation which decides<br>the fate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers<br>attend to the voice of their commander, or would they, disregarding him,<br>continue their flight? Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem<br>so terrible to the soldiers, despite his furious purple countenance<br>distorted out of all likeness to his former self, and the flourishing of<br>his saber, the soldiers all continued to run, talking, firing into the<br>air, and disobeying orders. The moral hesitation which decided the fate<br>of battles was evidently culminating in a panic.<br><br>The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the<br>powder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at that<br>moment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any apparent<br>reason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and Russian<br>sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse. It was Timókhin’s<br>company, which alone had maintained its order in the wood and, having<br>lain in ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly.<br>Timókhin, armed only with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such<br>a desperate cry and such mad, drunken determination that, taken by<br>surprise, the French had thrown down their muskets and run. Dólokhov,<br>running beside Timókhin, killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was<br>the first to seize the surrendering French officer by his collar. Our<br>fugitives returned, the battalions re-formed, and the French who had<br>nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed. Our<br>reserve units were able to join up, and the fight was at an end. The<br>regimental commander and Major Ekonómov had stopped beside a bridge,<br>letting the retreating companies pass by them, when a soldier came up<br>and took hold of the commander’s stirrup, almost leaning against him.<br>The man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth, he had no knapsack<br>or cap, his head was bandaged, and over his shoulder a French munition<br>pouch was slung. He had an officer’s sword in his hand. The soldier<br>was pale, his blue eyes looked impudently into the commander’s face,<br>and his lips were smiling. Though the commander was occupied in giving<br>instructions to Major Ekonómov, he could not help taking notice of the<br>soldier.<br><br>“Your excellency, here are two trophies,” said Dólokhov, pointing<br>to the French sword and pouch. “I have taken an officer prisoner. I<br>stopped the company.” Dólokhov breathed heavily from weariness and<br>spoke in abrupt sentences. “The whole company can bear witness. I beg<br>you will remember this, your excellency!”<br><br>“All right, all right,” replied the commander, and turned to Major<br>Ekonómov.<br><br>But Dólokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around his<br>head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.<br><br>“A bayonet wound. I remained at the front. Remember, your<br>excellency!”<br><br><br>Túshin’s battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the<br>action did Prince Bagratión, still hearing the cannonade in the center,<br>send his orderly staff officer, and later Prince Andrew also, to order<br>the battery to retire as quickly as possible. When the supports attached<br>to Túshin’s battery had been moved away in the middle of the action<br>by someone’s order, the battery had continued firing and was only not<br>captured by the French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone<br>could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended<br>guns. On the contrary, the energetic action of that battery led the<br>French to suppose that here—in the center—the main Russian forces<br>were concentrated. Twice they had attempted to attack this point, but on<br>each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated<br>guns on the hillock.<br><br>Soon after Prince Bagratión had left him, Túshin had succeeded in<br>setting fire to Schön Grabern.<br><br>“Look at them scurrying! It’s burning! Just see the smoke! Fine!<br>Grand! Look at the smoke, the smoke!” exclaimed the artillerymen,<br>brightening up.<br><br>All the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the<br>direction of the conflagration. As if urging each other on, the soldiers<br>cried at each shot: “Fine! That’s good! Look at it... Grand!” The<br>fire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading. The French columns<br>that had advanced beyond the village went back; but as though in revenge<br>for this failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village<br>and began firing them at Túshin’s battery.<br><br>In their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in<br>successfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed this<br>battery when two balls, and then four more, fell among our guns, one<br>knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition-wagon<br>driver’s leg. Their spirits once roused were, however, not diminished,<br>but only changed character. The horses were replaced by others from a<br>reserve gun carriage, the wounded were carried away, and the four guns<br>were turned against the ten-gun battery. Túshin’s companion officer<br>had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour<br>seventeen of the forty men of the guns’ crews had been disabled, but<br>the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever. Twice they<br>noticed the French appearing below them, and then they fired grapeshot<br>at them.<br><br>Little Túshin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly to<br>“refill my pipe for that one!” and then, scattering sparks from it,<br>ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the French.<br><br>“Smack at ‘em, lads!” he kept saying, seizing the guns by the<br>wheels and working the screws himself.<br><br>Amid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always made him<br>jump, Túshin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun,<br>now aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders about replacing<br>dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, and shouting in his<br>feeble voice, so high pitched and irresolute. His face grew more and<br>more animated. Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and<br>turn away from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always<br>the case, hesitated about lifting the injured or dead. The soldiers,<br>for the most part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an<br>artillery company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad<br>as their officer—all looked at their commander like children in an<br>embarrassing situation, and the expression on his face was invariably<br>reflected on theirs.<br><br>Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and<br>activity, Túshin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of<br>fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never<br>occurred to him. On the contrary, he became more and more elated. It<br>seemed to him that it was a very long time ago, almost a day, since he<br>had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and that the corner<br>of the field he stood on was well-known and familiar ground. Though he<br>thought of everything, considered everything, and did everything the<br>best of officers could do in his position, he was in a state akin to<br>feverish delirium or drunkenness.<br><br>From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and<br>thud of the enemy’s cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring<br>faces of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood<br>of men and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy’s side<br>(always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a<br>gun, a horse), from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of<br>his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded<br>him pleasure. The enemy’s guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes<br>from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker.<br><br>“There... he’s puffing again,” muttered Túshin to himself, as a<br>small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by<br>the wind.<br><br>“Now look out for the ball... we’ll throw it back.”<br><br>“What do you want, your honor?” asked an artilleryman, standing<br>close by, who heard him muttering.<br><br>“Nothing... only a shell...” he answered.<br><br>“Come along, our Matvévna!” he said to himself. “Matvévna” *<br>was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which<br>was large and of an old pattern. The French swarming round their guns<br>seemed to him like ants. In that world, the handsome drunkard Number One<br>of the second gun’s crew was “uncle”; Túshin looked at him more<br>often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement.<br>The sound of musketry at the foot of the hill, now diminishing, now<br>increasing, seemed like someone’s breathing. He listened intently to<br>the ebb and flow of these sounds.<br><br>    * Daughter of Matthew.<br><br>“Ah! Breathing again, breathing!” he muttered to himself.<br><br>He imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was throwing<br>cannon balls at the French with both hands.<br><br>“Now then, Matvévna, dear old lady, don’t let me down!” he was<br>saying as he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice called<br>above his head: “Captain Túshin! Captain!”<br><br>Túshin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who had turned<br>him out of the booth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping voice:<br><br>“Are you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, and you...”<br><br>“Why are they down on me?” thought Túshin, looking in alarm at his<br>superior.<br><br>“I... don’t...” he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap.<br>“I...”<br><br>But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say. A cannon<br>ball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his horse.<br>He paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another ball<br>stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped off.<br><br>“Retire! All to retire!” he shouted from a distance.<br><br>The soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same<br>order.<br><br>It was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to the space<br>where Túshin’s guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a<br>broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses.<br>Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the limbers lay<br>several dead men. One ball after another passed over as he approached<br>and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine. But the mere thought<br>of being afraid roused him again. “I cannot be afraid,” thought he,<br>and dismounted slowly among the guns. He delivered the order and did<br>not leave the battery. He decided to have the guns removed from their<br>positions and withdrawn in his presence. Together with Túshin, stepping<br>across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French, he attended<br>to the removal of the guns.<br><br>“A staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off,” said an<br>artilleryman to Prince Andrew. “Not like your honor!”<br><br>Prince Andrew said nothing to Túshin. They were both so busy as to seem<br>not to notice one another. When having limbered up the only two cannon<br>that remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down the hill<br>(one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind), Prince Andrew rode<br>up to Túshin.<br><br>“Well, till we meet again...” he said, holding out his hand to<br>Túshin.<br><br>“Good-by, my dear fellow,” said Túshin. “Dear soul! Good-by, my<br>dear fellow!” and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his<br>eyes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXI<br><br>The wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke,<br>hung low over the field of battle on the horizon. It was growing<br>dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous. The<br>cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on the<br>right sounded oftener and nearer. As soon as Túshin with his guns,<br>continually driving round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range<br>of fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff,<br>among them the staff officer and Zherkóv, who had been twice sent to<br>Túshin’s battery but had never reached it. Interrupting one<br>another, they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to how to proceed,<br>reprimanding and reproaching him. Túshin gave no orders, and,<br>silently—fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to<br>weep without knowing why—rode behind on his artillery nag. Though<br>the orders were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themselves<br>after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages. The jaunty<br>infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of<br>Túshin’s wattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on<br>“Matvévna’s” carriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar<br>cadet, supporting one hand with the other, came up to Túshin and asked<br>for a seat.<br><br>“Captain, for God’s sake! I’ve hurt my arm,” he said timidly.<br>“For God’s sake... I can’t walk. For God’s sake!”<br><br>It was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and<br>been refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice.<br><br>“Tell them to give me a seat, for God’s sake!”<br><br>“Give him a seat,” said Túshin. “Lay a cloak for him to sit on,<br>lad,” he said, addressing his favorite soldier. “And where is the<br>wounded officer?”<br><br>“He has been set down. He died,” replied someone.<br><br>“Help him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak,<br>Antónov.”<br><br>The cadet was Rostóv. With one hand he supported the other; he was<br>pale and his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed on<br>“Matvévna,” the gun from which they had removed the dead officer.<br>The cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his<br>breeches and arm.<br><br>“What, are you wounded, my lad?” said Túshin, approaching the gun<br>on which Rostóv sat.<br><br>“No, it’s a sprain.”<br><br>“Then what is this blood on the gun carriage?” inquired Túshin.<br><br>“It was the officer, your honor, stained it,” answered the<br>artilleryman, wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if<br>apologizing for the state of his gun.<br><br>It was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the<br>infantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted. It<br>had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces<br>off, and the firing had begun to subside. Suddenly, near by on the<br>right, shouting and firing were again heard. Flashes of shot gleamed in<br>the darkness. This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers<br>who had sheltered in the village houses. They all rushed out of<br>the village again, but Túshin’s guns could not move, and the<br>artillerymen, Túshin, and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they<br>awaited their fate. The firing died down and soldiers, talking eagerly,<br>streamed out of a side street.<br><br>“Not hurt, Petróv?” asked one.<br><br>“We’ve given it ‘em hot, mate! They won’t make another push<br>now,” said another.<br><br>“You couldn’t see a thing. How they shot at their own fellows!<br>Nothing could be seen. Pitch-dark, brother! Isn’t there something to<br>drink?”<br><br>The French had been repulsed for the last time. And again and again in<br>the complete darkness Túshin’s guns moved forward, surrounded by the<br>humming infantry as by a frame.<br><br>In the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing<br>always in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and the sound of<br>hoofs and wheels. Amid the general rumble, the groans and voices of the<br>wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness<br>of the night. The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their<br>groans, which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night.<br>After a while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on<br>a white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing:<br>“What did he say? Where to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us?” came<br>eager questions from all sides. The whole moving mass began pressing<br>closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt:<br>evidently those in front had halted. All remained where they were in the<br>middle of the muddy road.<br><br>Fires were lighted and the talk became more audible. Captain Túshin,<br>having given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing<br>station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a bonfire the<br>soldiers had kindled on the road. Rostóv, too, dragged himself to the<br>fire. From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering shook his whole<br>body. Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but he kept awake by<br>an excruciating pain in his arm, for which he could find no satisfactory<br>position. He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire,<br>which seemed to him dazzlingly red, and at the feeble, round-shouldered<br>figure of Túshin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk beside him.<br>Túshin’s large, kind, intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and<br>commiseration on Rostóv, who saw that Túshin with his whole heart<br>wished to help him but could not.<br><br>From all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry, who<br>were walking, driving past, and settling down all around. The sound<br>of voices, the tramping feet, the horses’ hoofs moving in mud, the<br>crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.<br><br>It was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through the<br>gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm.<br>Rostóv looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and<br>around him. An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held<br>his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.<br><br>“You don’t mind your honor?” he asked Túshin. “I’ve lost my<br>company, your honor. I don’t know where... such bad luck!”<br><br>With the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to<br>the bonfire, and addressing Túshin asked him to have the guns moved a<br>trifle to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to<br>the campfire. They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying<br>to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to.<br><br>“You picked it up?... I dare say! You’re very smart!” one of them<br>shouted hoarsely.<br><br>Then a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg<br>band, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.<br><br>“Must one die like a dog?” said he.<br><br>Túshin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier<br>ran up, begging a little fire for the infantry.<br><br>“A nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you, fellow<br>countrymen. Thanks for the fire—we’ll return it with interest,”<br>said he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.<br><br>Next came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed<br>by the fire. One of them stumbled.<br><br>“Who the devil has put the logs on the road?” snarled he.<br><br>“He’s dead—why carry him?” said another.<br><br>“Shut up!”<br><br>And they disappeared into the darkness with their load.<br><br>“Still aching?” Túshin asked Rostóv in a whisper.<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Your honor, you’re wanted by the general. He is in the hut here,”<br>said a gunner, coming up to Túshin.<br><br>“Coming, friend.”<br><br>Túshin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight,<br>walked away from the fire.<br><br>Not far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared<br>for him, Prince Bagratión sat at dinner, talking with some commanding<br>officers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old man with<br>the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the<br>general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a<br>glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with the signet<br>ring, and Zherkóv, uneasily glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew,<br>pale, with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes.<br><br>In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French, and<br>the accountant with the naïve face was feeling its texture, shaking his<br>head in perplexity—perhaps because the banner really interested him,<br>perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at<br>a dinner where there was no place for him. In the next hut there was a<br>French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons. Our officers<br>were flocking in to look at him. Prince Bagratión was thanking the<br>individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our<br>losses. The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was<br>informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn<br>from the wood, mustered the men who were woodcutting, and, allowing the<br>French to pass him, had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and<br>had broken up the French troops.<br><br>“When I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was<br>disorganized, I stopped in the road and thought: ‘I’ll let them<br>come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion’—and<br>that’s what I did.”<br><br>The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed<br>to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened. Perhaps<br>it might really have been so? Could one possibly make out amid all that<br>confusion what did or did not happen?<br><br>“By the way, your excellency, I should inform you,” he<br>continued—remembering Dólokhov’s conversation with Kutúzov and his<br>last interview with the gentleman-ranker—“that Private Dólokhov,<br>who was reduced to the ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my<br>presence and particularly distinguished himself.”<br><br>“I saw the Pávlograd hussars attack there, your excellency,” chimed<br>in Zherkóv, looking uneasily around. He had not seen the hussars all<br>that day, but had heard about them from an infantry officer. “They<br>broke up two squares, your excellency.”<br><br>Several of those present smiled at Zherkóv’s words, expecting one of<br>his usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to<br>the glory of our arms and of the day’s work, they assumed a serious<br>expression, though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie<br>devoid of any foundation. Prince Bagratión turned to the old colonel:<br><br>“Gentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved heroically:<br>infantry, cavalry, and artillery. How was it that two guns were<br>abandoned in the center?” he inquired, searching with his eyes for<br>someone. (Prince Bagratión did not ask about the guns on the left<br>flank; he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very<br>beginning of the action.) “I think I sent you?” he added, turning to<br>the staff officer on duty.<br><br>“One was damaged,” answered the staff officer, “and the other I<br>can’t understand. I was there all the time giving orders and had only<br>just left.... It is true that it was hot there,” he added, modestly.<br><br>Someone mentioned that Captain Túshin was bivouacking close to the<br>village and had already been sent for.<br><br>“Oh, but you were there?” said Prince Bagratión, addressing Prince<br>Andrew.<br><br>“Of course, we only just missed one another,” said the staff<br>officer, with a smile to Bolkónski.<br><br>“I had not the pleasure of seeing you,” said Prince Andrew, coldly<br>and abruptly.<br><br>All were silent. Túshin appeared at the threshold and made his way<br>timidly from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past the<br>generals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the<br>sight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and<br>stumbled over it. Several of those present laughed.<br><br>“How was it a gun was abandoned?” asked Bagratión, frowning, not so<br>much at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom Zherkóv<br>laughed loudest.<br><br>Only now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his guilt<br>and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present<br>themselves to Túshin in all their horror. He had been so excited that<br>he had not thought about it until that moment. The officers’ laughter<br>confused him still more. He stood before Bagratión with his lower<br>jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter: “I don’t know... your<br>excellency... I had no men... your excellency.”<br><br>“You might have taken some from the covering troops.”<br><br>Túshin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that<br>was perfectly true. He was afraid of getting some other officer into<br>trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Bagratión as a schoolboy who<br>has blundered looks at an examiner.<br><br>The silence lasted some time. Prince Bagratión, apparently not wishing<br>to be severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture to<br>intervene. Prince Andrew looked at Túshin from under his brows and his<br>fingers twitched nervously.<br><br>“Your excellency!” Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt<br>voice, “you were pleased to send me to Captain Túshin’s battery. I<br>went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two<br>guns smashed, and no supports at all.”<br><br>Prince Bagratión and Túshin looked with equal intentness at<br>Bolkónski, who spoke with suppressed agitation.<br><br>“And, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion,” he<br>continued, “we owe today’s success chiefly to the action of that<br>battery and the heroic endurance of Captain Túshin and his company,”<br>and without awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table.<br><br>Prince Bagratión looked at Túshin, evidently reluctant to show<br>distrust in Bolkónski’s emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully<br>to credit it, bent his head, and told Túshin that he could go. Prince<br>Andrew went out with him.<br><br>“Thank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!” said Túshin.<br><br>Prince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away. He felt<br>sad and depressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what he had hoped.<br><br><br>“Who are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will<br>all this end?” thought Rostóv, looking at the changing shadows before<br>him. The pain in his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible<br>drowsiness overpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the<br>impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged<br>with the physical pain. It was they, these soldiers—wounded and<br>unwounded—it was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting<br>the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder. To<br>rid himself of them he closed his eyes.<br><br>For a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things<br>appeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand,<br>Sónya’s thin little shoulders, Natásha’s eyes and laughter,<br>Denísov with his voice and mustache, and Telyánin and all that affair<br>with Telyánin and Bogdánich. That affair was the same thing as this<br>soldier with the harsh voice, and it was that affair and this soldier<br>that were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and<br>always dragging it in one direction. He tried to get away from them, but<br>they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair’s breadth.<br>It would not ache—it would be well—if only they did not pull it, but<br>it was impossible to get rid of them.<br><br>He opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night hung less<br>than a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of falling snow were<br>fluttering in that light. Túshin had not returned, the doctor had not<br>come. He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting naked at<br>the other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow body.<br><br>“Nobody wants me!” thought Rostóv. “There is no one to help me or<br>pity me. Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved.” He sighed<br>and, doing so, groaned involuntarily.<br><br>“Eh, is anything hurting you?” asked the soldier, shaking his shirt<br>out over the fire, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and<br>added: “What a lot of men have been crippled today—frightful!”<br><br>Rostóv did not listen to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes<br>fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm,<br>bright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his<br>healthy body, and all the affection and care of his family. “And why<br>did I come here?” he wondered.<br><br>Next day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant of<br>Bagratión’s detachment was reunited to Kutúzov’s army.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK THREE: 1805<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>Prince Vasíli was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans.<br>Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage. He<br>was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had<br>become a habit. Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted<br>to himself, but which formed the whole interest of his life,<br>were constantly shaping themselves in his mind, arising from the<br>circumstances and persons he met. Of these plans he had not merely one<br>or two in his head but dozens, some only beginning to form themselves,<br>some approaching achievement, and some in course of disintegration. He<br>did not, for instance, say to himself: “This man now has influence, I<br>must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special<br>grant.” Nor did he say to himself: “Pierre is a rich man, I must<br>entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles<br>I need.” But when he came across a man of position his instinct<br>immediately told him that this man could be useful, and without any<br>premeditation Prince Vasíli took the first opportunity to gain his<br>confidence, flatter him, become intimate with him, and finally make his<br>request.<br><br>He had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as<br>Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the status of<br>Councilor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to<br>Petersburg and staying at his house. With apparent absent-mindedness,<br>yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing,<br>Prince Vasíli did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter. Had<br>he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural<br>and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both<br>above and below him in social standing. Something always drew him toward<br>those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in<br>seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people.<br><br>Pierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezúkhov and a rich man, felt<br>himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and<br>preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself. He had to<br>sign papers, to present himself at government offices, the purpose of<br>which was not clear to him, to question his chief steward, to visit his<br>estate near Moscow, and to receive many people who formerly did not<br>even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended<br>and grieved had he chosen not to see them. These different<br>people—businessmen, relations, and acquaintances alike—were all<br>disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering<br>manner: they were all evidently firmly convinced of Pierre’s noble<br>qualities. He was always hearing such words as: “With your remarkable<br>kindness,” or, “With your excellent heart,” “You are yourself so<br>honorable, Count,” or, “Were he as clever as you,” and so on,<br>till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and<br>extraordinary intelligence, the more so as in the depth of his heart it<br>had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent.<br>Even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently<br>unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate. The angry eldest<br>princess, with the long waist and hair plastered down like a doll’s,<br>had come into Pierre’s room after the funeral. With drooping eyes<br>and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past<br>misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for<br>anything, except only for permission, after the blow she had received,<br>to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where<br>she had sacrificed so much. She could not refrain from weeping at these<br>words. Touched that this statuesque princess could so change, Pierre<br>took her hand and begged her forgiveness, without knowing what for.<br>From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began<br>knitting a striped scarf for him.<br><br>“Do this for my sake, mon cher; after all, she had to put up with a<br>great deal from the deceased,” said Prince Vasíli to him, handing him<br>a deed to sign for the princess’ benefit.<br><br>Prince Vasíli had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw<br>this bone—a bill for thirty thousand rubles—to the poor princess<br>that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of<br>the inlaid portfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess<br>grew still kinder. The younger sisters also became affectionate to him,<br>especially the youngest, the pretty one with the mole, who often made<br>him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him.<br><br>It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it<br>would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he could<br>not but believe in the sincerity of those around him. Besides, he had<br>no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not. He<br>was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful<br>intoxication. He felt as though he were the center of some important and<br>general movement; that something was constantly expected of him, that if<br>he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people, but if he<br>did this and that, all would be well; and he did what was demanded of<br>him, but still that happy result always remained in the future.<br><br>More than anyone else, Prince Vasíli took possession of Pierre’s<br>affairs and of Pierre himself in those early days. From the death of<br>Count Bezúkhov he did not let go his hold of the lad. He had the air of<br>a man oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would not, for<br>pity’s sake, leave this helpless youth who, after all, was the son of<br>his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth, to the caprice<br>of fate and the designs of rogues. During the few days he spent in<br>Moscow after the death of Count Bezúkhov, he would call Pierre, or<br>go to him himself, and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of<br>weariness and assurance, as if he were adding every time: “You know<br>I am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that<br>I trouble myself about you, and you also know quite well that what I<br>propose is the only thing possible.”<br><br>“Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last,” said Prince<br>Vasíli one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierre’s elbow,<br>speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed<br>upon and could not now be altered. “We start tomorrow and I’m giving<br>you a place in my carriage. I am very glad. All our important business<br>here is now settled, and I ought to have been off long ago. Here is<br>something I have received from the chancellor. I asked him for you, and<br>you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of<br>the Bedchamber. The diplomatic career now lies open before you.”<br><br>Notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words<br>were pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his career,<br>wished to make some suggestion. But Prince Vasíli interrupted him in<br>the special deep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of interrupting<br>his speech, which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was<br>needed.<br><br>“Mais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my conscience,<br>and there is nothing to thank me for. No one has ever complained yet of<br>being too much loved; and besides, you are free, you could throw it<br>up tomorrow. But you will see everything for yourself when you get to<br>Petersburg. It is high time for you to get away from these terrible<br>recollections.” Prince Vasíli sighed. “Yes, yes, my boy. And my<br>valet can go in your carriage. Ah! I was nearly forgetting,” he added.<br>“You know, mon cher, your father and I had some accounts to settle, so<br>I have received what was due from the Ryazán estate and will keep it;<br>you won’t require it. We’ll go into the accounts later.”<br><br>By “what was due from the Ryazán estate” Prince Vasíli meant<br>several thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierre’s peasants,<br>which the prince had retained for himself.<br><br>In Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of<br>gentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather the<br>rank (for he did nothing), that Prince Vasíli had procured for him,<br>and acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so numerous<br>that, even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle,<br>and continual expectation of some good, always in front of him but never<br>attained.<br><br>Of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg.<br>The Guards had gone to the front; Dólokhov had been reduced to the<br>ranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew<br>was abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he<br>used to like to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with<br>a friend older than himself and whom he respected. His whole time<br>was taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince<br>Vasíli’s house in the company of the stout princess, his wife, and<br>his beautiful daughter Hélène.<br><br>Like the others, Anna Pávlovna Schérer showed Pierre the change of<br>attitude toward him that had taken place in society.<br><br>Formerly in Anna Pávlovna’s presence, Pierre had always felt that<br>what he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that<br>remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became<br>foolish as soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary Hippolyte’s<br>stupidest remarks came out clever and apt. Now everything Pierre said<br>was charmant. Even if Anna Pávlovna did not say so, he could see that<br>she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty.<br><br>In the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna<br>Pávlovna’s usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added:<br>“You will find the beautiful Hélène here, whom it is always<br>delightful to see.”<br><br>When he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some<br>link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and<br>Hélène, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were<br>being imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased him as an<br>entertaining supposition.<br><br>Anna Pávlovna’s “At Home” was like the former one, only the<br>novelty she offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a<br>diplomatist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details of the<br>Emperor Alexander’s visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august<br>friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold<br>the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race. Anna Pávlovna<br>received Pierre with a shade of melancholy, evidently relating to the<br>young man’s recent loss by the death of Count Bezúkhov (everyone<br>constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly<br>afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known), and her<br>melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention<br>of her most august Majesty the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. Pierre felt<br>flattered by this. Anna Pávlovna arranged the different groups in her<br>drawing room with her habitual skill. The large group, in which were<br>Prince Vasíli and the generals, had the benefit of the diplomat.<br>Another group was at the tea table. Pierre wished to join the former,<br>but Anna Pávlovna—who was in the excited condition of a commander on<br>a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which<br>there is hardly time to put in action—seeing Pierre, touched his<br>sleeve with her finger, saying:<br><br>“Wait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening.”<br>(She glanced at Hélène and smiled at her.) “My dear Hélène, be<br>charitable to my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep her company for<br>ten minutes. And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear count<br>who will not refuse to accompany you.”<br><br>The beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pávlovna detained Pierre, looking<br>as if she had to give some final necessary instructions.<br><br>“Isn’t she exquisite?” she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately<br>beauty as she glided away. “And how she carries herself! For so young<br>a girl, such tact, such masterly perfection of manner! It comes from<br>her heart. Happy the man who wins her! With her the least worldly of men<br>would occupy a most brilliant position in society. Don’t you think so?<br>I only wanted to know your opinion,” and Anna Pávlovna let Pierre go.<br><br>Pierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to Hélène’s<br>perfection of manner. If he ever thought of Hélène, it was just of<br>her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in<br>society.<br><br>The old aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed<br>desirous of hiding her adoration for Hélène and inclined rather<br>to show her fear of Anna Pávlovna. She looked at her niece, as if<br>inquiring what she was to do with these people. On leaving them, Anna<br>Pávlovna again touched Pierre’s sleeve, saying: “I hope you won’t<br>say that it is dull in my house again,” and she glanced at Hélène.<br><br>Hélène smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the<br>possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted. The aunt<br>coughed, swallowed, and said in French that she was very pleased to see<br>Hélène, then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome<br>and the same look. In the middle of a dull and halting conversation,<br>Hélène turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave<br>to everyone. Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so little<br>meaning for him, that he paid no attention to it. The aunt was just<br>speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierre’s<br>father, Count Bezúkhov, and showed them her own box. Princess Hélène<br>asked to see the portrait of the aunt’s husband on the box lid.<br><br>“That is probably the work of Vinesse,” said Pierre, mentioning<br>a celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the<br>snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.<br><br>He half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the snuffbox,<br>passing it across Hélène’s back. Hélène stooped forward to make<br>room, and looked round with a smile. She was, as always at evening<br>parties, wearing a dress such as was then fashionable, cut very low at<br>front and back. Her bust, which had always seemed like marble to Pierre,<br>was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive<br>the living charm of her neck and shoulders, so near to his lips that<br>he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them. He was<br>conscious of the warmth of her body, the scent of perfume, and the<br>creaking of her corset as she moved. He did not see her marble beauty<br>forming a complete whole with her dress, but all the charm of her body<br>only covered by her garments. And having once seen this he could not<br>help being aware of it, just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once<br>seen through.<br><br>“So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?” Hélène<br>seemed to say. “You had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a<br>woman who may belong to anyone—to you too,” said her glance. And at<br>that moment Pierre felt that Hélène not only could, but must, be his<br>wife, and that it could not be otherwise.<br><br>He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the<br>altar with her. How and when this would be he did not know, he did not<br>even know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he knew not why,<br>that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would happen.<br><br>Pierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see<br>her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen her every<br>day until then, but he could no longer do it. He could not, any more<br>than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the<br>mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has<br>once recognized it to be a tuft of grass. She was terribly close to him.<br>She already had power over him, and between them there was no longer any<br>barrier except the barrier of his own will.<br><br>“Well, I will leave you in your little corner,” came Anna<br>Pávlovna’s voice, “I see you are all right there.”<br><br>And Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything<br>reprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to him that everyone<br>knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself.<br><br>A little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna Pávlovna said<br>to him: “I hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?”<br><br>This was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, and<br>Pierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg house<br>done up.<br><br>“That’s a good thing, but don’t move from Prince Vasíli’s. It<br>is good to have a friend like the prince,” she said, smiling at Prince<br>Vasíli. “I know something about that. Don’t I? And you are still so<br>young. You need advice. Don’t be angry with me for exercising an old<br>woman’s privilege.”<br><br>She paused, as women always do, expecting something after they have<br>mentioned their age. “If you marry it will be a different thing,”<br>she continued, uniting them both in one glance. Pierre did not look at<br>Hélène nor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. He<br>muttered something and colored.<br><br>When he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what<br>had happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely understood that<br>the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was mentioned<br>he had said absent-mindedly: “Yes, she’s good looking,” he had<br>understood that this woman might belong to him.<br><br>“But she’s stupid. I have myself said she is stupid,” he thought.<br>“There is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites<br>in me. I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her<br>and she with him, that there was quite a scandal and that that’s why<br>he was sent away. Hippolyte is her brother... Prince Vasíli is her<br>father... It’s bad....” he reflected, but while he was thinking this<br>(the reflection was still incomplete), he caught himself smiling and was<br>conscious that another line of thought had sprung up, and while thinking<br>of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his<br>wife, how she would love him become quite different, and how all he had<br>thought and heard of her might be false. And he again saw her not as the<br>daughter of Prince Vasíli, but visualized her whole body only veiled<br>by its gray dress. “But no! Why did this thought never occur to me<br>before?” and again he told himself that it was impossible, that there<br>would be something unnatural, and as it seemed to him dishonorable, in<br>this marriage. He recalled her former words and looks and the words<br>and looks of those who had seen them together. He recalled Anna<br>Pávlovna’s words and looks when she spoke to him about his house,<br>recalled thousands of such hints from Prince Vasíli and others, and was<br>seized by terror lest he had already, in some way, bound himself to do<br>something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do. But at<br>the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself, in another<br>part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>In November, 1805, Prince Vasíli had to go on a tour of inspection<br>in four different provinces. He had arranged this for himself so as to<br>visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole<br>where his regiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince Nicholas<br>Bolkónski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that<br>rich old man. But before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs,<br>Prince Vasíli had to settle matters with Pierre, who, it is true, had<br>latterly spent whole days at home, that is, in Prince Vasíli’s house<br>where he was staying, and had been absurd, excited, and foolish in<br>Hélène’s presence (as a lover should be), but had not yet proposed<br>to her.<br><br>“This is all very fine, but things must be settled,” said Prince<br>Vasíli to himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that<br>Pierre who was under such obligations to him (“But never mind that”)<br>was not behaving very well in this matter. “Youth, frivolity... well,<br>God be with him,” thought he, relishing his own goodness of heart,<br>“but it must be brought to a head. The day after tomorrow will be<br>Lëlya’s name day. I will invite two or three people, and if he does<br>not understand what he ought to do then it will be my affair—yes, my<br>affair. I am her father.”<br><br>Six weeks after Anna Pávlovna’s “At Home” and after the sleepless<br>night when he had decided that to marry Hélène would be a calamity and<br>that he ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision,<br>had not left Prince Vasíli’s and felt with terror that in people’s<br>eyes he was every day more and more connected with her, that it was<br>impossible for him to return to his former conception of her, that he<br>could not break away from her, and that though it would be a terrible<br>thing he would have to unite his fate with hers. He might perhaps have<br>been able to free himself but that Prince Vasíli (who had rarely before<br>given receptions) now hardly let a day go by without having an evening<br>party at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil<br>the general pleasure and disappoint everyone’s expectation. Prince<br>Vasíli, in the rare moments when he was at home, would take Pierre’s<br>hand in passing and draw it downwards, or absent-mindedly hold out his<br>wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say: “Till<br>tomorrow,” or, “Be in to dinner or I shall not see you,” or, “I<br>am staying in for your sake,” and so on. And though Prince Vasíli,<br>when he stayed in (as he said) for Pierre’s sake, hardly exchanged a<br>couple of words with him, Pierre felt unable to disappoint him.<br>Every day he said to himself one and the same thing: “It is time I<br>understood her and made up my mind what she really is. Was I mistaken<br>before, or am I mistaken now? No, she is not stupid, she is an excellent<br>girl,” he sometimes said to himself “she never makes a mistake,<br>never says anything stupid. She says little, but what she does say is<br>always clear and simple, so she is not stupid. She never was abashed and<br>is not abashed now, so she cannot be a bad woman!” He had often begun<br>to make reflections or think aloud in her company, and she had always<br>answered him either by a brief but appropriate remark—showing that it<br>did not interest her—or by a silent look and smile which more palpably<br>than anything else showed Pierre her superiority. She was right in<br>regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile.<br><br>She always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him<br>alone, in which there was something more significant than in the general<br>smile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that everyone was<br>waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that<br>sooner or later he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror<br>seized him at the thought of that dreadful step. A thousand times during<br>that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to<br>that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself: “What am I doing? I need<br>resolution. Can it be that I have none?”<br><br>He wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this matter<br>he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really<br>possessed. Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel<br>themselves quite innocent, and since that day when he was overpowered<br>by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna<br>Pávlovna’s, an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire<br>paralyzed his will.<br><br>On Hélène’s name day, a small party of just their own people—as<br>his wife said—met for supper at Prince Vasíli’s. All these friends<br>and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young<br>girl would be decided that evening. The visitors were seated at supper.<br>Princess Kurágina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome,<br>was sitting at the head of the table. On either side of her sat the<br>more important guests—an old general and his wife, and Anna Pávlovna<br>Schérer. At the other end sat the younger and less important guests,<br>and there too sat the members of the family, and Pierre and Hélène,<br>side by side. Prince Vasíli was not having any supper: he went round<br>the table in a merry mood, sitting down now by one, now by another, of<br>the guests. To each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark<br>except to Pierre and Hélène, whose presence he seemed not to notice.<br>He enlivened the whole party. The wax candles burned brightly, the<br>silver and crystal gleamed, so did the ladies’ toilets and the gold<br>and silver of the men’s epaulets; servants in scarlet liveries moved<br>round the table, the clatter of plates, knives, and glasses mingled with<br>the animated hum of several conversations. At one end of the table, the<br>old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her<br>passionately, at which she laughed; at the other could be heard the<br>story of the misfortunes of some Mary Víktorovna or other. At the<br>center of the table, Prince Vasíli attracted everybody’s attention.<br>With a facetious smile on his face, he was telling the ladies about last<br>Wednesday’s meeting of the Imperial Council, at which Sergéy Kuzmích<br>Vyazmítinov, the new military governor general of Petersburg, had<br>received and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander<br>from the army to Sergéy Kuzmích, in which the Emperor said that he was<br>receiving from all sides declarations of the people’s loyalty, that<br>the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure, and that<br>he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be<br>worthy of it. This rescript began with the words: “Sergéy Kuzmích,<br>From all sides reports reach me,” etc.<br><br>“Well, and so he never got farther than: ‘Sergéy Kuzmích’?”<br>asked one of the ladies.<br><br>“Exactly, not a hair’s breadth farther,” answered Prince Vasíli,<br>laughing, “‘Sergéy Kuzmích... From all sides... From all sides...<br>Sergéy Kuzmích...’ Poor Vyazmítinov could not get any farther!<br>He began the rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered<br>‘Sergéy’ he sobbed, ‘Kuz-mí-ch,’ tears, and ‘From all<br>sides’ was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther. And again<br>his handkerchief, and again: ‘Sergéy Kuzmích, From all sides,’...<br>and tears, till at last somebody else was asked to read it.”<br><br>“Kuzmích... From all sides... and then tears,” someone repeated<br>laughing.<br><br>“Don’t be unkind,” cried Anna Pávlovna from her end of the table<br>holding up a threatening finger. “He is such a worthy and excellent<br>man, our dear Vyazmítinov....”<br><br>Everybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where the<br>honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the<br>influence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre and<br>Hélène sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a<br>suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing<br>to do with Sergéy Kuzmích—a smile of bashfulness at their own<br>feelings. But much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked, much<br>as they enjoyed their Rhine wine, sauté, and ices, and however they<br>avoided looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobservant as<br>they seemed of them, one could feel by the occasional glances they gave<br>that the story about Sergéy Kuzmích, the laughter, and the food<br>were all a pretense, and that the whole attention of that company was<br>directed to—Pierre and Hélène. Prince Vasíli mimicked the sobbing<br>of Sergéy Kuzmích and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his<br>daughter, and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said:<br>“Yes... it’s getting on, it will all be settled today.” Anna<br>Pávlovna threatened him on behalf of “our dear Vyazmítinov,” and<br>in her eyes, which, for an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince Vasíli<br>read a congratulation on his future son-in-law and on his daughter’s<br>happiness. The old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the<br>old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter, and her sigh<br>seemed to say: “Yes, there’s nothing left for you and me but to sip<br>sweet wine, my dear, now that the time has come for these young ones to<br>be thus boldly, provocatively happy.” “And what nonsense all this is<br>that I am saying!” thought a diplomatist, glancing at the happy faces<br>of the lovers. “That’s happiness!”<br><br>Into the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that<br>society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy<br>and handsome young man and woman for one another. And this human feeling<br>dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter.<br>Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the animation was<br>evidently forced. Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at<br>table seemed to feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked<br>at the beautiful Hélène with her radiant face and at the red, broad,<br>and happy though uneasy face of Pierre. It seemed as if the very light<br>of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone.<br><br>Pierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased and<br>embarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation.<br>He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. Only now and<br>then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot<br>unexpectedly through his mind.<br><br>“So it is all finished!” he thought. “And how has it all happened?<br>How quickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself<br>alone, but because of everyone, it must inevitably come about. They are<br>all expecting it, they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I<br>cannot, disappoint them. But how will it be? I do not know, but it<br>will certainly happen!” thought Pierre, glancing at those dazzling<br>shoulders close to his eyes.<br><br>Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what. He felt it<br>awkward to attract everyone’s attention and to be considered a<br>lucky man and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris<br>possessed of a Helen. “But no doubt it always is and must be so!”<br>he consoled himself. “And besides, what have I done to bring it about?<br>How did it begin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince Vasíli. Then there<br>was nothing. So why should I not stay at his house? Then I played cards<br>with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her. How did it<br>begin, when did it all come about?” And here he was sitting by her<br>side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her nearness, her<br>breathing, her movements, her beauty. Then it would suddenly seem to him<br>that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful, and that that was<br>why they all looked so at him, and flattered by this general admiration<br>he would expand his chest, raise his head, and rejoice at his good<br>fortune. Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a<br>second time. But Pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what<br>was said.<br><br>“I am asking you when you last heard from Bolkónski,” repeated<br>Prince Vasíli a third time. “How absent-minded you are, my dear<br>fellow.”<br><br>Prince Vasíli smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at<br>him and Hélène. “Well, what of it, if you all know it?” thought<br>Pierre. “What of it? It’s the truth!” and he himself smiled his<br>gentle childlike smile, and Hélène smiled too.<br><br>“When did you get the letter? Was it from Olmütz?” repeated<br>Prince Vasíli, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a<br>dispute.<br><br>“How can one talk or think of such trifles?” thought Pierre.<br><br>“Yes, from Olmütz,” he answered, with a sigh.<br><br>After supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the<br>drawing room. The guests began to disperse, some without taking leave<br>of Hélène. Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an important<br>occupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away,<br>refusing to let her see them off. The diplomatist preserved a mournful<br>silence as he left the drawing room. He pictured the vanity of his<br>diplomatic career in comparison with Pierre’s happiness. The old<br>general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was. “Oh, the<br>old fool,” he thought. “That Princess Hélène will be beautiful<br>still when she’s fifty.”<br><br>“I think I may congratulate you,” whispered Anna Pávlovna to the<br>old princess, kissing her soundly. “If I hadn’t this headache I’d<br>have stayed longer.”<br><br>The old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her<br>daughter’s happiness.<br><br>While the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time<br>alone with Hélène in the little drawing room where they were sitting.<br>He had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her,<br>but had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt that it was inevitable,<br>but he could not make up his mind to take the final step. He felt<br>ashamed; he felt that he was occupying someone else’s place here<br>beside Hélène. “This happiness is not for you,” some inner voice<br>whispered to him. “This happiness is for those who have not in them<br>what there is in you.”<br><br>But, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether she was<br>satisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple manner that<br>this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had.<br><br>Some of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in<br>the large drawing room. Prince Vasíli came up to Pierre with languid<br>footsteps. Pierre rose and said it was getting late. Prince Vasíli gave<br>him a look of stern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was<br>so strange that one could not take it in. But then the expression of<br>severity changed, and he drew Pierre’s hand downwards, made him sit<br>down, and smiled affectionately.<br><br>“Well, Lëlya?” he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and<br>addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to<br>parents who have petted their children from babyhood, but which Prince<br>Vasíli had only acquired by imitating other parents.<br><br>And he again turned to Pierre.<br><br>“Sergéy Kuzmích—From all sides—” he said, unbuttoning the top<br>button of his waistcoat.<br><br>Pierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story<br>about Sergéy Kuzmích that interested Prince Vasíli just then, and<br>Prince Vasíli saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered<br>something and went away. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was<br>disconcerted. The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world<br>touched Pierre: he looked at Hélène and she too seemed disconcerted,<br>and her look seemed to say: “Well, it is your own fault.”<br><br>“The step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!” thought Pierre,<br>and he again began speaking about indifferent matters, about Sergéy<br>Kuzmích, asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it<br>properly. Hélène answered with a smile that she too had missed it.<br><br>When Prince Vasíli returned to the drawing room, the princess, his<br>wife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.<br><br>“Of course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear...”<br><br>“Marriages are made in heaven,” replied the elderly lady.<br><br>Prince Vasíli passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down<br>on a sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and seemed to<br>be dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself.<br><br>“Aline,” he said to his wife, “go and see what they are about.”<br><br>The princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and<br>indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room. Pierre and<br>Hélène still sat talking just as before.<br><br>“Still the same,” she said to her husband.<br><br>Prince Vasíli frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his<br>face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. Shaking<br>himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went<br>past the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he went<br>joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre<br>rose in alarm on seeing it.<br><br>“Thank God!” said Prince Vasíli. “My wife has told me<br>everything!” (He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his<br>daughter.)—“My dear boy... Lëlya... I am very pleased.” (His<br>voice trembled.) “I loved your father... and she will make you a good<br>wife... God bless you!...”<br><br>He embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his<br>malodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.<br><br>“Princess, come here!” he shouted.<br><br>The old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using<br>her handkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful<br>Hélène’s hand several times. After a while they were left alone<br>again.<br><br>“All this had to be and could not be otherwise,” thought Pierre,<br>“so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad. It is good because<br>it’s definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt.” Pierre<br>held the hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful<br>bosom as it rose and fell.<br><br>“Hélène!” he said aloud and paused.<br><br>“Something special is always said in such cases,” he thought, but<br>could not remember what it was that people say. He looked at her face.<br>She drew nearer to him. Her face flushed.<br><br>“Oh, take those off... those...” she said, pointing to his<br>spectacles.<br><br>Pierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes have<br>from which spectacles have just been removed, had also a frightened and<br>inquiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but<br>with a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she intercepted his<br>lips and met them with her own. Her face struck Pierre, by its altered,<br>unpleasantly excited expression.<br><br>“It is too late now, it’s done; besides I love her,” thought<br>Pierre.<br><br>“Je vous aime!” * he said, remembering what has to be said at such<br>moments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.<br><br>    * “I love you.”<br><br><br>Six weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bezúkhov’s<br>large, newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as people<br>said, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>Old Prince Nicholas Bolkónski received a letter from Prince Vasíli<br>in November, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying him<br>a visit. “I am starting on a journey of inspection, and of course I<br>shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at<br>the same time, my honored benefactor,” wrote Prince Vasíli. “My son<br>Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you will<br>allow him personally to express the deep respect that, emulating his<br>father, he feels for you.”<br><br>“It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors are<br>coming to us of their own accord,” incautiously remarked the little<br>princess on hearing the news.<br><br>Prince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.<br><br>A fortnight after the letter Prince Vasíli’s servants came one<br>evening in advance of him, and he and his son arrived next day.<br><br>Old Bolkónski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vasíli’s<br>character, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and<br>Alexander Prince Vasíli had risen to high position and honors. And now,<br>from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess,<br>he saw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into<br>a feeling of contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever he mentioned<br>him. On the day of Prince Vasíli’s arrival, Prince Bolkónski was<br>particularly discontented and out of temper. Whether he was in a bad<br>temper because Prince Vasíli was coming, or whether his being in a bad<br>temper made him specially annoyed at Prince Vasíli’s visit, he was<br>in a bad temper, and in the morning Tíkhon had already advised the<br>architect not to go to the prince with his report.<br><br>“Do you hear how he’s walking?” said Tíkhon, drawing the<br>architect’s attention to the sound of the prince’s footsteps.<br>“Stepping flat on his heels—we know what that means....”<br><br>However, at nine o’clock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable<br>collar and cap, went out for his usual walk. It had snowed the day<br>before and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the<br>habit of walking, had been swept: the marks of the broom were still<br>visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the<br>soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path. The prince went<br>through the conservatories, the serfs’ quarters, and the outbuildings,<br>frowning and silent.<br><br>“Can a sleigh pass?” he asked his overseer, a venerable man,<br>resembling his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him<br>back to the house.<br><br>“The snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your honor.”<br><br>The prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. “God be<br>thanked,” thought the overseer, “the storm has blown over!”<br><br>“It would have been hard to drive up, your honor,” he added. “I<br>heard, your honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor.”<br><br>The prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him,<br>frowning.<br><br>“What? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?” he said in<br>his shrill, harsh voice. “The road is not swept for the princess my<br>daughter, but for a minister! For me, there are no ministers!”<br><br>“Your honor, I thought...”<br><br>“You thought!” shouted the prince, his words coming more and more<br>rapidly and indistinctly. “You thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!...<br>I’ll teach you to think!” and lifting his stick he swung it and<br>would have hit Alpátych, the overseer, had not the latter instinctively<br>avoided the blow. “Thought... Blackguards...” shouted the prince<br>rapidly.<br><br>But although Alpátych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the<br>stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly before<br>him, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he continued<br>to shout: “Blackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!” did not<br>lift his stick again but hurried into the house.<br><br>Before dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew<br>that the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne with a radiant face that said: “I know nothing, I am the<br>same as usual,” and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with downcast<br>eyes. What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions<br>she ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not.<br>She thought: “If I seem not to notice he will think that I do not<br>sympathize with him; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself, he will<br>say (as he has done before) that I’m in the dumps.”<br><br>The prince looked at his daughter’s frightened face and snorted.<br><br>“Fool... or dummy!” he muttered.<br><br>“And the other one is not here. They’ve been telling tales,” he<br>thought—referring to the little princess who was not in the dining<br>room.<br><br>“Where is the princess?” he asked. “Hiding?”<br><br>“She is not very well,” answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with<br>a bright smile, “so she won’t come down. It is natural in her<br>state.”<br><br>“Hm! Hm!” muttered the prince, sitting down.<br><br>His plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he<br>flung it away. Tíkhon caught it and handed it to a footman. The little<br>princess was not unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the prince<br>that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear.<br><br>“I am afraid for the baby,” she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne:<br>“Heaven knows what a fright might do.”<br><br>In general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear, and<br>with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not<br>realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. The prince<br>reciprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt<br>for her. When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald<br>Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole<br>days with her, asked her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her<br>about the old prince and criticized him.<br><br>“So we are to have visitors, mon prince?” remarked Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. “His<br>Excellency Prince Vasíli Kurágin and his son, I understand?” she<br>said inquiringly.<br><br>“Hm!—his excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment in the<br>service,” said the prince disdainfully. “Why his son is coming I<br>don’t understand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know.<br>I don’t want him.” (He looked at his blushing daughter.) “Are you<br>unwell today? Eh? Afraid of the ‘minister’ as that idiot Alpátych<br>called him this morning?”<br><br>“No, mon père.”<br><br>Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice<br>of a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the<br>conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and<br>after the soup the prince became more genial.<br><br>After dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess<br>was sitting at a small table, chattering with Másha, her maid. She grew<br>pale on seeing her father-in-law.<br><br>She was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. Her cheeks<br>had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.<br><br>“Yes, I feel a kind of oppression,” she said in reply to the<br>prince’s question as to how she felt.<br><br>“Do you want anything?”<br><br>“No, merci, mon père.”<br><br>“Well, all right, all right.”<br><br>He left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpátych stood with<br>bowed head.<br><br>“Has the snow been shoveled back?”<br><br>“Yes, your excellency. Forgive me for heaven’s sake... It was only<br>my stupidity.”<br><br>“All right, all right,” interrupted the prince, and laughing his<br>unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for Alpátych to kiss, and then<br>proceeded to his study.<br><br>Prince Vasíli arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue by<br>coachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to<br>one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.<br><br>Prince Vasíli and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.<br><br>Anatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a<br>table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his<br>large and handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life as a continual round<br>of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him.<br>And he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly<br>heiress in the same way. All this might, he thought, turn out very well<br>and amusingly. “And why not marry her if she really has so much money?<br>That never does any harm,” thought Anatole.<br><br>He shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had<br>become habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his<br>father’s room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to<br>him. Prince Vasíli’s two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked<br>round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter<br>entered, as if to say: “Yes, that’s how I want you to look.”<br><br>“I say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?” Anatole asked,<br>as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been<br>mentioned during the journey.<br><br>“Enough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious<br>with the old prince.”<br><br>“If he starts a row I’ll go away,” said Prince Anatole. “I<br>can’t bear those old men! Eh?”<br><br>“Remember, for you everything depends on this.”<br><br>In the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservants’ rooms that<br>the minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of both had<br>been minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room,<br>vainly trying to master her agitation.<br><br>“Why did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never<br>happen!” she said, looking at herself in the glass. “How shall I<br>enter the drawing room? Even if I like him I can’t now be myself with<br>him.” The mere thought of her father’s look filled her with terror.<br>The little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received<br>from Másha, the lady’s maid, the necessary report of how handsome the<br>minister’s son was, with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with<br>what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son<br>had followed him like an eagle, three steps at a time. Having received<br>this information, the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose<br>chattering voices had reached her from the corridor, went into Princess<br>Mary’s room.<br><br>“You know they’ve come, Marie?” said the little princess, waddling<br>in, and sinking heavily into an armchair.<br><br>She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning,<br>but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully done and her<br>face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded<br>outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still<br>more noticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch<br>had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne’s toilet which rendered her<br>fresh and pretty face yet more attractive.<br><br>“What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?” she<br>began. “They’ll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing<br>room and we shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself<br>up at all!”<br><br>The little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily<br>began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be<br>dressed. Princess Mary’s self-esteem was wounded by the fact that<br>the arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both<br>her companions’ not having the least conception that it could be<br>otherwise. To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them<br>would be to betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to<br>dress her would prolong their banter and insistence. She flushed, her<br>beautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took<br>on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she<br>submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both these women<br>quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty. She was so plain that<br>neither of them could think of her as a rival, so they began dressing<br>her with perfect sincerity, and with the naïve and firm conviction<br>women have that dress can make a face pretty.<br><br>“No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,” said Lise, looking<br>sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. “You have a maroon<br>dress, have it fetched. Really! You know the fate of your whole life may<br>be at stake. But this one is too light, it’s not becoming!”<br><br>It was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary<br>that was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little<br>princess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed<br>in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on<br>the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They forgot that<br>the frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that<br>however they might change the setting and adornment of that face, it<br>would still remain piteous and plain. After two or three changes to<br>which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her hair had been arranged<br>on the top of her head (a style that quite altered and spoiled her<br>looks) and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf, the<br>little princess walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the<br>dress with her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her<br>with her head bent first on one side and then on the other.<br><br>“No, it will not do,” she said decidedly, clasping her hands. “No,<br>Mary, really this dress does not suit you. I prefer you in your little<br>gray everyday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie,” she said<br>to the maid, “bring the princess her gray dress, and you’ll see,<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it,” she added, smiling<br>with a foretaste of artistic pleasure.<br><br>But when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained<br>sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the<br>mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst<br>into sobs.<br><br>“Come, dear princess,” said Mademoiselle Bourienne, “just one more<br>little effort.”<br><br>The little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess<br>Mary.<br><br>“Well, now we’ll arrange something quite simple and becoming,” she<br>said.<br><br>The three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne’s, and Katie’s, who<br>was laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping<br>of birds.<br><br>“No, leave me alone,” said Princess Mary.<br><br>Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds<br>was silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful<br>eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at<br>them, and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist.<br><br>“At least, change your coiffure,” said the little princess.<br>“Didn’t I tell you,” she went on, turning reproachfully to<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne, “Mary’s is a face which such a coiffure does<br>not suit in the least. Not in the least! Please change it.”<br><br>“Leave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite the same to<br>me,” answered a voice struggling with tears.<br><br>Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves<br>that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse than usual,<br>but it was too late. She was looking at them with an expression they<br>both knew, an expression thoughtful and sad. This expression in Princess<br>Mary did not frighten them (she never inspired fear in anyone), but they<br>knew that when it appeared on her face, she became mute and was not to<br>be shaken in her determination.<br><br>“You will change it, won’t you?” said Lise. And as Princess Mary<br>gave no answer, she left the room.<br><br>Princess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Lise’s request,<br>she not only left her hair as it was, but did not even look in her<br>glass. Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and<br>pondered. A husband, a man, a strong dominant and strangely attractive<br>being rose in her imagination, and carried her into a totally different<br>happy world of his own. She fancied a child, her own—such as she had<br>seen the day before in the arms of her nurse’s daughter—at her<br>own breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the<br>child. “But no, it is impossible, I am too ugly,” she thought.<br><br>“Please come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment,” came the<br>maid’s voice at the door.<br><br>She roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and<br>before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her<br>eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a<br>lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments. A painful<br>doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a<br>man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of<br>happiness and of children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing<br>was for earthly love. The more she tried to hide this feeling from<br>others and even from herself, the stronger it grew. “O God,” she<br>said, “how am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil?<br>How am I to renounce forever these vile fancies, so as peacefully to<br>fulfill Thy will?” And scarcely had she put that question than God<br>gave her the answer in her own heart. “Desire nothing for thyself,<br>seek nothing, be not anxious or envious. Man’s future and thy own fate<br>must remain hidden from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for<br>anything. If it be God’s will to prove thee in the duties of marriage,<br>be ready to fulfill His will.” With this consoling thought (but<br>yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing)<br>Princess Mary sighed, and having crossed herself went down, thinking<br>neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what<br>she would say. What could all that matter in comparison with the will of<br>God, without Whose care not a hair of man’s head can fall?<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>When Princess Mary came down, Prince Vasíli and his son were already<br>in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels,<br>the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess,<br>indicating her to the gentlemen, said: “Voilà Marie!” Princess Mary<br>saw them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince Vasíli’s face,<br>serious for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling<br>again, and the little princess curiously noting the impression<br>“Marie” produced on the visitors. And she saw Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and her unusually animated<br>look which was fixed on him, but him she could not see, she only saw<br>something large, brilliant, and handsome moving toward her as she<br>entered the room. Prince Vasíli approached first, and she kissed the<br>bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by<br>saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well. Then<br>Anatole came up to her. She still could not see him. She only felt a<br>soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her lips a white<br>forehead, over which was beautiful light-brown hair smelling of pomade.<br>When she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty. Anatole stood<br>with his right thumb under a button of his uniform, his chest expanded<br>and his back drawn in, slightly swinging one foot, and, with his head a<br>little bent, looked with beaming face at the princess without<br>speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all. Anatole was not<br>quick-witted, nor ready or eloquent in conversation, but he had the<br>faculty, so invaluable in society, of composure and imperturbable<br>self-possession. If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on<br>a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of<br>such silence and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is<br>bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the<br>princess’ hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this way for<br>a very long time. “If anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let him<br>talk, but I don’t want to,” he seemed to say. Besides this, in his<br>behavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in<br>them curiosity, awe, and even love—a supercilious consciousness of<br>his own superiority. It was as if he said to them: “I know you, I know<br>you, but why should I bother about you? You’d be only too glad, of<br>course.” Perhaps he did not really think this when he met women—even<br>probably he did not, for in general he thought very little—but his<br>looks and manner gave that impression. The princess felt this, and as if<br>wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him,<br>she turned to his father. The conversation was general and animated,<br>thanks to Princess Lise’s voice and little downy lip that lifted over<br>her white teeth. She met Prince Vasíli with that playful manner often<br>employed by lively chatty people, and consisting in the assumption<br>that between the person they so address and themselves there are some<br>semi-private, long-established jokes and amusing reminiscences, though<br>no such reminiscences really exist—just as none existed in this case.<br>Prince Vasíli readily adopted her tone and the little princess also<br>drew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections of<br>things that had never occurred. Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them<br>and even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these<br>merry reminiscences.<br><br>“Here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to<br>ourselves, dear prince,” said the little princess (of course, in<br>French) to Prince Vasíli. “It’s not as at Annette’s * receptions<br>where you always ran away; you remember cette chère Annette!”<br><br>    * Anna Pávlovna.<br><br>“Ah, but you won’t talk politics to me like Annette!”<br><br>“And our little tea table?”<br><br>“Oh, yes!”<br><br>“Why is it you were never at Annette’s?” the little princess asked<br>Anatole. “Ah, I know, I know,” she said with a sly glance, “your<br>brother Hippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!” and she shook her<br>finger at him, “I have even heard of your doings in Paris!”<br><br>“And didn’t Hippolyte tell you?” asked Prince Vasíli, turning to<br>his son and seizing the little princess’ arm as if she would have run<br>away and he had just managed to catch her, “didn’t he tell you how<br>he himself was pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the<br>door? Oh, she is a pearl among women, Princess,” he added, turning to<br>Princess Mary.<br><br>When Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the<br>opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.<br><br>She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole<br>had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole answered the<br>Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her<br>about her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole<br>came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either.<br>“Not at all bad!” he thought, examining her, “not at all bad, that<br>little companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when we’re<br>married, la petite est gentille.” *<br><br>    * The little one is charming.<br><br>The old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering<br>what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. “What are<br>Prince Vasíli and that son of his to me? Prince Vasíli is a shallow<br>braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,” he grumbled to<br>himself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived<br>in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about<br>which he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever<br>bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The<br>prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand<br>that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only<br>with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without<br>Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to<br>him. “And why should she marry?” he thought. “To be unhappy for<br>certain. There’s Lise, married to Andrew—a better husband one would<br>think could hardly be found nowadays—but is she contented with her<br>lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! They’ll<br>take her for her connections and wealth. Are there no women living<br>unmarried, and even the happier for it?” So thought Prince Bolkónski<br>while dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded<br>an immediate answer. Prince Vasíli had brought his son with the evident<br>intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask<br>for an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. “Well,<br>I’ve nothing against it,” the prince said to himself, “but he must<br>be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see.”<br><br>“That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!” he added<br>aloud.<br><br>He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly<br>round the company. He noticed the change in the little princess’<br>dress, Mademoiselle Bourienne’s ribbon, Princess Mary’s unbecoming<br>coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienne’s and Anatole’s smiles, and the<br>loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation. “Got herself<br>up like a fool!” he thought, looking irritably at her. “She is<br>shameless, and he ignores her!”<br><br>He went straight up to Prince Vasíli.<br><br>“Well! How d’ye do? How d’ye do? Glad to see you!”<br><br>“Friendship laughs at distance,” began Prince Vasíli in his usual<br>rapid, self-confident, familiar tone. “Here is my second son; please<br>love and befriend him.”<br><br>Prince Bolkónski surveyed Anatole.<br><br>“Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!” he said. “Well, come and<br>kiss me,” and he offered his cheek.<br><br>Anatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect<br>composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had<br>told him to expect.<br><br>Prince Bolkónski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa<br>and, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vasíli, pointed to it and began<br>questioning him about political affairs and news. He seemed to listen<br>attentively to what Prince Vasíli said, but kept glancing at Princess<br>Mary.<br><br>“And so they are writing from Potsdam already?” he said, repeating<br>Prince Vasíli’s last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his<br>daughter.<br><br>“Is it for visitors you’ve got yourself up like that, eh?” said<br>he. “Fine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for<br>the visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are<br>never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent.”<br><br>“It was my fault, mon père,” interceded the little princess, with a<br>blush.<br><br>“You must do as you please,” said Prince Bolkónski, bowing to his<br>daughter-in-law, “but she need not make a fool of herself, she’s<br>plain enough as it is.”<br><br>And he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was<br>reduced to tears.<br><br>“On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,” said<br>Prince Vasíli.<br><br>“Now you, young prince, what’s your name?” said Prince Bolkónski,<br>turning to Anatole, “come here, let us talk and get acquainted.”<br><br>“Now the fun begins,” thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile<br>beside the old prince.<br><br>“Well, my dear boy, I hear you’ve been educated abroad, not taught<br>to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me,<br>my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?” asked the old man,<br>scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.<br><br>“No, I have been transferred to the line,” said Anatole, hardly able<br>to restrain his laughter.<br><br>“Ah! That’s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the<br>Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve.<br>Well, are you off to the front?”<br><br>“No, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached...<br>what is it I am attached to, Papa?” said Anatole, turning to his<br>father with a laugh.<br><br>“A splendid soldier, splendid! ‘What am I attached to!’ Ha, ha,<br>ha!” laughed Prince Bolkónski, and Anatole laughed still louder.<br>Suddenly Prince Bolkónski frowned.<br><br>“You may go,” he said to Anatole.<br><br>Anatole returned smiling to the ladies.<br><br>“And so you’ve had him educated abroad, Prince Vasíli, haven’t<br>you?” said the old prince to Prince Vasíli.<br><br>“I have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there<br>is much better than ours.”<br><br>“Yes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The<br>lad’s a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now.” He took<br>Prince Vasíli’s arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were<br>alone together, Prince Vasíli announced his hopes and wishes to the old<br>prince.<br><br>“Well, do you think I shall prevent her, that I can’t part from<br>her?” said the old prince angrily. “What an idea! I’m ready for it<br>tomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better. You<br>know my principles—everything aboveboard! I will ask her tomorrow in<br>your presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and<br>I’ll see.” The old prince snorted. “Let her marry, it’s all the<br>same to me!” he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting<br>from his son.<br><br>“I will tell you frankly,” said Prince Vasíli in the tone of<br>a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so<br>keen-sighted a companion. “You know, you see right through people.<br>Anatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent<br>son or kinsman.”<br><br>“All right, all right, we’ll see!”<br><br>As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time<br>without male society, on Anatole’s appearance all the three women of<br>Prince Bolkónski’s household felt that their life had not been real<br>till then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately<br>increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in<br>darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.<br><br>Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The<br>handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed<br>all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and<br>magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of dreams of a future<br>family life continually rose in her imagination. She drove them away and<br>tried to conceal them.<br><br>“But am I not too cold with him?” thought the princess. “I try<br>to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him<br>already, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine<br>that I do not like him.”<br><br>And Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new<br>guest. “Poor girl, she’s devilish ugly!” thought Anatole.<br><br>Mademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatole’s<br>arrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young woman<br>without any definite position, without relations or even a country, did<br>not intend to devote her life to serving Prince Bolkónski, to reading<br>aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to<br>appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed,<br>ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her<br>off; and here at last was a Russian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew<br>a story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she<br>liked to repeat to herself. It was the story of a girl who had been<br>seduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa pauvre mère) appeared, and<br>reproached her for yielding to a man without being married. Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this<br>story to him, her seducer. And now he, a real Russian prince, had<br>appeared. He would carry her away and then sa pauvre mère would appear<br>and he would marry her. So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne’s head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about<br>Paris. It was not calculation that guided her (she did not even for a<br>moment consider what she should do), but all this had long been familiar<br>to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around<br>him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible.<br><br>The little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet,<br>unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the<br>familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any<br>struggle, but with naïve and lighthearted gaiety.<br><br>Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man<br>tired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the<br>spectacle of his power over these three women. Besides that, he was<br>beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne<br>that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great<br>suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.<br><br>After tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was<br>asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits,<br>came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion.<br>Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and<br>the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic. But<br>Anatole’s expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not<br>to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienne’s little<br>foot, which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord.<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess Mary, and in her<br>lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new<br>to the princess.<br><br>“How she loves me!” thought Princess Mary. “How happy I am now,<br>and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband?<br>Can it be possible?” she thought, not daring to look at his face, but<br>still feeling his eyes gazing at her.<br><br>In the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole<br>kissed Princess Mary’s hand. She did not know how she found the<br>courage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near<br>to her shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and<br>kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne’s hand. (This was not etiquette, but<br>then he did everything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look.<br><br>“What delicacy!” thought the princess. “Is it possible that<br>Amélie” (Mademoiselle Bourienne) “thinks I could be jealous of her,<br>and not value her pure affection and devotion to me?” She went up<br>to her and kissed her warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little<br>princess’ hand.<br><br>“No! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving<br>well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!” she said. And<br>smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>They all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he<br>got into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.<br><br>“Is he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kind—yes,<br>kind, that is the chief thing,” thought Princess Mary; and fear, which<br>she had seldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to look round, it<br>seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the<br>dark corner. And this someone was he—the devil—and he was also this<br>man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.<br><br>She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.<br><br>Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long<br>time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now<br>working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mère<br>rebuking her for her fall.<br><br>The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made.<br>She could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every position was<br>awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than<br>ever because Anatole’s presence had vividly recalled to her the time<br>when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay. She<br>sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy<br>and disheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third<br>time, muttering to herself.<br><br>“I told you it was all lumps and holes!” the little princess<br>repeated. “I should be glad enough to fall asleep, so it’s not my<br>fault!” and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.<br><br>The old prince did not sleep either. Tíkhon, half asleep, heard him<br>pacing angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though he<br>had been insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed<br>because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he<br>loved more than himself. He kept telling himself that he would consider<br>the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act, but<br>instead of that he only excited himself more and more.<br><br>“The first man that turns up—she forgets her father and everything<br>else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike<br>herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she knew I should notice<br>it. Fr... fr... fr! And don’t I see that that idiot had eyes only for<br>Bourienne—I shall have to get rid of her. And how is it she has not<br>pride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself she might at<br>least have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thinks<br>nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne. No, she has no pride... but<br>I’ll let her see....”<br><br>The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a<br>mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne,<br>Princess Mary’s self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to<br>be parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this<br>thought, he called Tíkhon and began to undress.<br><br>“What devil brought them here?” thought he, while Tíkhon was<br>putting the nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest.<br>“I never invited them. They came to disturb my life—and there is not<br>much of it left.”<br><br>“Devil take ‘em!” he muttered, while his head was still covered by<br>the shirt.<br><br>Tíkhon knew his master’s habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and<br>therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of<br>the face that emerged from the shirt.<br><br>“Gone to bed?” asked the prince.<br><br>Tíkhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his<br>master’s thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince<br>Vasíli and his son.<br><br>“They have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency.”<br><br>“No good... no good...” said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his<br>feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing<br>gown, he went to the couch on which he slept.<br><br>Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne,<br>they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance,<br>up to the appearance of the pauvre mère; they understood that they had<br>much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an<br>opportunity since morning to meet one another alone. When Princess Mary<br>went to her father’s room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne<br>and Anatole met in the conservatory.<br><br>Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation.<br>It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be<br>decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She<br>read this in Tíkhon’s face and in that of Prince Vasíli’s valet,<br>who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot<br>water.<br><br>The old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of<br>his daughter that morning. Princess Mary well knew this painstaking<br>expression of her father’s. His face wore that expression when his<br>dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in<br>arithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her,<br>repeating in a low voice the same words several times over.<br><br>He came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.<br><br>“I have had a proposition made me concerning you,” he said with an<br>unnatural smile. “I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasíli has<br>not come and brought his pupil with him” (for some reason Prince<br>Bolkónski referred to Anatole as a “pupil”) “for the sake of my<br>beautiful eyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account<br>and, as you know my principles, I refer it to you.”<br><br>“How am I to understand you, mon père?” said the princess, growing<br>pale and then blushing.<br><br>“How understand me!” cried her father angrily. “Prince Vasíli<br>finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you<br>on his pupil’s behalf. That’s how it’s to be understood! ‘How<br>understand it’!... And I ask you!”<br><br>“I do not know what you think, Father,” whispered the princess.<br><br>“I? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question. I’m not going to<br>get married. What about you? That’s what I want to know.”<br><br>The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval,<br>but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be<br>decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze<br>under which she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to<br>submit from habit, and she said: “I wish only to do your will, but if<br>I had to express my own desire...” She had no time to finish. The old<br>prince interrupted her.<br><br>“That’s admirable!” he shouted. “He will take you with your<br>dowry and take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain. She’ll be the<br>wife, while you...”<br><br>The prince stopped. He saw the effect these words had produced on his<br>daughter. She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.<br><br>“Now then, now then, I’m only joking!” he said. “Remember this,<br>Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to<br>choose. I give you freedom. Only remember that your life’s happiness<br>depends on your decision. Never mind me!”<br><br>“But I do not know, Father!”<br><br>“There’s no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry you<br>or anybody; but you are free to choose.... Go to your room, think it<br>over, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no.<br>I know you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but you had better<br>think it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!” he still shouted<br>when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the<br>study.<br><br>Her fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had said<br>about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be sure, but<br>still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it. She was<br>going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing<br>anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw<br>Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her. With<br>a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess<br>Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne who had not yet seen her.<br><br>“Who’s that? Why? Wait a moment!” Anatole’s face seemed to say.<br>Princess Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand it. At<br>last Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole bowed to<br>Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at<br>this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door<br>that led to his own apartments.<br><br>An hour later, Tíkhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince;<br>he added that Prince Vasíli was also there. When Tíkhon came to her<br>Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair. The<br>princess’ beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were<br>looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bourienne’s<br>pretty face.<br><br>“No, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!” said<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne.<br><br>“Why? I love you more than ever,” said Princess Mary, “and I will<br>try to do all I can for your happiness.”<br><br>“But you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand being so<br>carried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother...”<br><br>“I quite understand,” answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile.<br>“Calm yourself, my dear. I will go to my father,” she said, and went<br>out.<br><br>Prince Vasíli, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox<br>in his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face,<br>as if stirred to his heart’s core and himself regretting and laughing<br>at his own sensibility, when Princess Mary entered. He hurriedly took a<br>pinch of snuff.<br><br>“Ah, my dear, my dear!” he began, rising and taking her by both<br>hands. Then, sighing, he added: “My son’s fate is in your hands.<br>Decide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved as a<br>daughter!”<br><br>He drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.<br><br>“Fr... fr...” snorted Prince Bolkónski. “The prince is making a<br>proposition to you in his pupil’s—I mean, his son’s—name. Do you<br>wish or not to be Prince Anatole Kurágin’s wife? Reply: yes or no,”<br>he shouted, “and then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion<br>also. Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion,” added Prince Bolkónski,<br>turning to Prince Vasíli and answering his imploring look. “Yes, or<br>no?”<br><br>“My desire is never to leave you, Father, never to separate my<br>life from yours. I don’t wish to marry,” she answered positively,<br>glancing at Prince Vasíli and at her father with her beautiful eyes.<br><br>“Humbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!” cried Prince Bolkónski,<br>frowning and taking his daughter’s hand; he did not kiss her, but only<br>bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so<br>that she winced and uttered a cry.<br><br>Prince Vasíli rose.<br><br>“My dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never<br>forget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching<br>this heart, so kind and generous? Say ‘perhaps’... The future is so<br>long. Say ‘perhaps.’”<br><br>“Prince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you for<br>the honor, but I shall never be your son’s wife.”<br><br>“Well, so that’s finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have<br>seen you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!” said<br>the old prince. “Very, very glad to have seen you,” repeated he,<br>embracing Prince Vasíli.<br><br>“My vocation is a different one,” thought Princess Mary. “My<br>vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness<br>of love and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will arrange<br>poor Amélie’s happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so<br>passionately repents. I will do all I can to arrange the match between<br>them. If he is not rich I will give her the means; I will ask my<br>father and Andrew. I shall be so happy when she is his wife. She is so<br>unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God, how passionately<br>she must love him if she could so far forget herself! Perhaps I might<br>have done the same!...” thought Princess Mary.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>It was long since the Rostóvs had news of Nicholas. Not till midwinter<br>was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son’s<br>handwriting. On receiving it, he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and<br>haste, trying to escape notice, closed the door, and began to read the<br>letter.<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna, who always knew everything that passed in the house,<br>on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and<br>found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at the same<br>time.<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still<br>living with the Rostóvs.<br><br>“My dear friend?” said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, prepared<br>to sympathize in any way.<br><br>The count sobbed yet more.<br><br>“Nikólenka... a letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling<br>boy... the countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How<br>tell the little countess!”<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief wiped<br>the tears from his eyes and from the letter, then having dried her<br>own eyes she comforted the count, and decided that at dinner and till<br>teatime she would prepare the countess, and after tea, with God’s<br>help, would inform her.<br><br>At dinner Anna Mikháylovna talked the whole time about the war news<br>and about Nikólenka, twice asked when the last letter had been received<br>from him, though she knew that already, and remarked that they might<br>very likely be getting a letter from him that day. Each time that these<br>hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at<br>the count and at Anna Mikháylovna, the latter very adroitly turned<br>the conversation to insignificant matters. Natásha, who, of the whole<br>family, was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of<br>intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning<br>of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her<br>father and Anna Mikháylovna, that it had something to do with her<br>brother, and that Anna Mikháylovna was preparing them for it. Bold as<br>she was, Natásha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything<br>relating to Nikólenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner,<br>but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her<br>chair regardless of her governess’ remarks. After dinner, she rushed<br>headlong after Anna Mikháylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on<br>her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room.<br><br>“Auntie, darling, do tell me what it is!”<br><br>“Nothing, my dear.”<br><br>“No, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won’t give up—I know you know<br>something.”<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna shook her head.<br><br>“You are a little slyboots,” she said.<br><br>“A letter from Nikólenka! I’m sure of it!” exclaimed Natásha,<br>reading confirmation in Anna Mikháylovna’s face.<br><br>“But for God’s sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your<br>mamma.”<br><br>“I will, I will, only tell me! You won’t? Then I will go and tell at<br>once.”<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna, in a few words, told her the contents of the letter,<br>on condition that she should tell no one.<br><br>“No, on my true word of honor,” said Natásha, crossing herself,<br>“I won’t tell anyone!” and she ran off at once to Sónya.<br><br>“Nikólenka... wounded... a letter,” she announced in gleeful<br>triumph.<br><br>“Nicholas!” was all Sónya said, instantly turning white.<br><br>Natásha, seeing the impression the news of her brother’s wound<br>produced on Sónya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the<br>news.<br><br>She rushed to Sónya, hugged her, and began to cry.<br><br>“A little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he<br>wrote himself,” said she through her tears.<br><br>“There now! It’s true that all you women are crybabies,” remarked<br>Pétya, pacing the room with large, resolute strides. “Now I’m very<br>glad, very glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so.<br>You are all blubberers and understand nothing.”<br><br>Natásha smiled through her tears.<br><br>“You haven’t read the letter?” asked Sónya.<br><br>“No, but she said that it was all over and that he’s now an<br>officer.”<br><br>“Thank God!” said Sónya, crossing herself. “But perhaps she<br>deceived you. Let us go to Mamma.”<br><br>Pétya paced the room in silence for a time.<br><br>“If I’d been in Nikólenka’s place I would have killed even more<br>of those Frenchmen,” he said. “What nasty brutes they are! I’d<br>have killed so many that there’d have been a heap of them.”<br><br>“Hold your tongue, Pétya, what a goose you are!”<br><br>“I’m not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles,” said<br>Pétya.<br><br>“Do you remember him?” Natásha suddenly asked, after a moment’s<br>silence.<br><br>Sónya smiled.<br><br>“Do I remember Nicholas?”<br><br>“No, Sónya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly,<br>remember everything?” said Natásha, with an expressive gesture,<br>evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning. “I<br>remember Nikólenka too, I remember him well,” she said. “But I<br>don’t remember Borís. I don’t remember him a bit.”<br><br>“What! You don’t remember Borís?” asked Sónya in surprise.<br><br>“It’s not that I don’t remember—I know what he is like, but not<br>as I remember Nikólenka. Him—I just shut my eyes and remember,<br>but Borís... No!” (She shut her eyes.) “No! there’s nothing at<br>all.”<br><br>“Oh, Natásha!” said Sónya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at<br>her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant<br>to say and as if she were saying it to someone else, with whom joking<br>was out of the question, “I am in love with your brother once for all<br>and, whatever may happen to him or to me, shall never cease to love him<br>as long as I live.”<br><br>Natásha looked at Sónya with wondering and inquisitive eyes, and said<br>nothing. She felt that Sónya was speaking the truth, that there was<br>such love as Sónya was speaking of. But Natásha had not yet felt<br>anything like it. She believed it could be, but did not understand it.<br><br>“Shall you write to him?” she asked.<br><br>Sónya became thoughtful. The question of how to write to Nicholas, and<br>whether she ought to write, tormented her. Now that he was already an<br>officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself<br>and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on<br>himself?<br><br>“I don’t know. I think if he writes, I will write too,” she said,<br>blushing.<br><br>“And you won’t feel ashamed to write to him?”<br><br>Sónya smiled.<br><br>“No.”<br><br>“And I should be ashamed to write to Borís. I’m not going to.”<br><br>“Why should you be ashamed?”<br><br>“Well, I don’t know. It’s awkward and would make me ashamed.”<br><br>“And I know why she’d be ashamed,” said Pétya, offended by<br>Natásha’s previous remark. “It’s because she was in love with<br>that fat one in spectacles” (that was how Pétya described his<br>namesake, the new Count Bezúkhov) “and now she’s in love with that<br>singer” (he meant Natásha’s Italian singing master), “that’s<br>why she’s ashamed!”<br><br>“Pétya, you’re a stupid!” said Natásha.<br><br>“Not more stupid than you, madam,” said the nine-year-old Pétya,<br>with the air of an old brigadier.<br><br>The countess had been prepared by Anna Mikháylovna’s hints at dinner.<br>On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a<br>miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears<br>kept coming into her eyes. Anna Mikháylovna, with the letter, came on<br>tiptoe to the countess’ door and paused.<br><br>“Don’t come in,” she said to the old count who was following her.<br>“Come later.” And she went in, closing the door behind her.<br><br>The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.<br><br>At first he heard the sound of indifferent voices, then Anna<br>Mikháylovna’s voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then silence,<br>then both voices together with glad intonations, and then footsteps.<br>Anna Mikháylovna opened the door. Her face wore the proud expression<br>of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the<br>public to appreciate his skill.<br><br>“It is done!” she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the<br>countess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and<br>in the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her lips.<br><br>When she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his<br>bald head, over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait,<br>and in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away<br>the bald head. Véra, Natásha, Sónya, and Pétya now entered the room,<br>and the reading of the letter began. After a brief description of<br>the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part, and his<br>promotion, Nicholas said that he kissed his father’s and mother’s<br>hands asking for their blessing, and that he kissed Véra, Natásha, and<br>Pétya. Besides that, he sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling, Madame<br>Schoss, and his old nurse, and asked them to kiss for him “dear<br>Sónya, whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever.” When she<br>heard this Sónya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and, unable<br>to bear the looks turned upon her, ran away into the dancing hall,<br>whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon,<br>and, flushed and smiling, plumped down on the floor. The countess was<br>crying.<br><br>“Why are you crying, Mamma?” asked Véra. “From all he says one<br>should be glad and not cry.”<br><br>This was quite true, but the count, the countess, and Natásha looked<br>at her reproachfully. “And who is it she takes after?” thought the<br>countess.<br><br>Nicholas’ letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were<br>considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she<br>did not let it out of her hands. The tutors came, and the nurses, and<br>Dmítri, and several acquaintances, and the countess reread the letter<br>each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh<br>proofs of Nikólenka’s virtues. How strange, how extraordinary, how<br>joyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose<br>tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son about whom<br>she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count, that son who<br>had first learned to say “pear” and then “granny,” that this son<br>should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings, a manly<br>warrior doing some kind of man’s work of his own, without help or<br>guidance. The universal experience of ages, showing that children do<br>grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood, did not exist for the<br>countess. Her son’s growth toward manhood, at each of its stages,<br>had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the<br>millions of human beings who grew up in the same way. As twenty<br>years before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived<br>somewhere under her heart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to<br>speak, so now she could not believe that that little creature could be<br>this strong, brave man, this model son and officer that, judging by this<br>letter, he now was.<br><br>“What a style! How charmingly he describes!” said she, reading the<br>descriptive part of the letter. “And what a soul! Not a word about<br>himself.... Not a word! About some Denísov or other, though he himself,<br>I dare say, is braver than any of them. He says nothing about his<br>sufferings. What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has remembered<br>everybody! Not forgetting anyone. I always said when he was only so<br>high—I always said....”<br><br>For more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of<br>letters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out,<br>while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the<br>count, money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment<br>of the newly commissioned officer were collected. Anna Mikháylovna,<br>practical woman that she was, had even managed by favor with army<br>authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself<br>and her son. She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand<br>Duke Constantine Pávlovich, who commanded the Guards. The Rostóvs<br>supposed that The Russian Guards, Abroad, was quite a definite address,<br>and that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards<br>there was no reason why it should not reach the Pávlograd regiment,<br>which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood. And so it was<br>decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Duke’s courier to<br>Borís and Borís was to forward them to Nicholas. The letters were from<br>the old count, the countess, Pétya, Véra, Natásha, and Sónya, and<br>finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other<br>things the old count sent to his son.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>On the twelfth of November, Kutúzov’s active army, in camp before<br>Olmütz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperors—the<br>Russian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent<br>the night ten miles from Olmütz and next morning were to come straight<br>to the review, reaching the field at Olmütz by ten o’clock.<br><br>That day Nicholas Rostóv received a letter from Borís, telling him<br>that the Ismáylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from<br>Olmütz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for<br>him. Rostóv was particularly in need of money now that the troops,<br>after their active service, were stationed near Olmütz and the camp<br>swarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering<br>all sorts of tempting wares. The Pávlograds held feast after feast,<br>celebrating awards they had received for the campaign, and made<br>expeditions to Olmütz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian,<br>who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses.<br>Rostóv, who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought<br>Denísov’s horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his comrades and<br>the sutlers. On receiving Borís’ letter he rode with a fellow officer<br>to Olmütz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set off alone<br>to the Guards’ camp to find his old playmate. Rostóv had not yet had<br>time to get his uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with<br>a soldier’s cross, equally shabby cadet’s riding breeches lined with<br>worn leather, and an officer’s saber with a sword knot. The Don horse<br>he was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign,<br>and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his<br>head. As he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress Borís<br>and all his comrades of the Guards by his appearance—that of a<br>fighting hussar who had been under fire.<br><br>The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading<br>their cleanliness and discipline. They had come by easy stages, their<br>knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had provided<br>excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place. The regiments<br>had entered and left the town with their bands playing, and by the Grand<br>Duke’s orders the men had marched all the way in step (a practice on<br>which the Guards prided themselves), the officers on foot and at their<br>proper posts. Borís had been quartered, and had marched all the<br>way, with Berg who was already in command of a company. Berg, who had<br>obtained his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of<br>his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money<br>matters very satisfactorily. Borís, during the campaign, had made the<br>acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him, and by<br>a letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become<br>acquainted with Prince Andrew Bolkónski, through whom he hoped to<br>obtain a post on the commander in chief’s staff. Berg and Borís,<br>having rested after yesterday’s march, were sitting, clean and neatly<br>dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them,<br>playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees. Borís, in<br>the accurate way characteristic of him, was building a little pyramid of<br>chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting Berg’s move,<br>and watched his opponent’s face, evidently thinking about the game as<br>he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on.<br><br>“Well, how are you going to get out of that?” he remarked.<br><br>“We’ll try to,” replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing<br>his hand.<br><br>At that moment the door opened.<br><br>“Here he is at last!” shouted Rostóv. “And Berg too! Oh, you<br>petisenfans, allay cushay dormir!” he exclaimed, imitating his Russian<br>nurse’s French, at which he and Borís used to laugh long ago.<br><br>“Dear me, how you have changed!”<br><br>Borís rose to meet Rostóv, but in doing so did not omit to steady and<br>replace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace his<br>friend, but Nicholas avoided him. With that peculiar feeling of youth,<br>that dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a manner<br>different from that of its elders which is often insincere, Nicholas<br>wished to do something special on meeting his friend. He wanted to pinch<br>him, push him, do anything but kiss him—a thing everybody did. But<br>notwithstanding this, Borís embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and<br>kissed him three times.<br><br>They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young<br>men take their first steps on life’s road, each saw immense changes in<br>the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken<br>those first steps. Both had changed greatly since they last met and both<br>were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.<br><br>“Oh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if you’d been to a fete,<br>not like us sinners of the line,” cried Rostóv, with martial swagger<br>and with baritone notes in his voice, new to Borís, pointing to his own<br>mud-bespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing Rostóv’s loud<br>voice, popped her head in at the door.<br><br>“Eh, is she pretty?” he asked with a wink.<br><br>“Why do you shout so? You’ll frighten them!” said Borís. “I did<br>not expect you today,” he added. “I only sent you the note yesterday<br>by Bolkónski—an adjutant of Kutúzov’s, who’s a friend of mine.<br>I did not think he would get it to you so quickly.... Well, how are you?<br>Been under fire already?” asked Borís.<br><br>Without answering, Rostóv shook the soldier’s Cross of St. George<br>fastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm,<br>glanced at Berg with a smile.<br><br>“As you see,” he said.<br><br>“Indeed? Yes, yes!” said Borís, with a smile. “And we too have<br>had a splendid march. You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness<br>rode with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and<br>every advantage. What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and<br>balls! I can’t tell you. And the Tsarévich was very gracious to all<br>our officers.”<br><br>And the two friends told each other of their doings, the one of his<br>hussar revels and life in the fighting line, the other of the pleasures<br>and advantages of service under members of the Imperial family.<br><br>“Oh, you Guards!” said Rostóv. “I say, send for some wine.”<br><br>Borís made a grimace.<br><br>“If you really want it,” said he.<br><br>He went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, and sent<br>for wine.<br><br>“Yes, and I have some money and a letter to give you,” he added.<br><br>Rostóv took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both<br>arms on the table and began to read. After reading a few lines, he<br>glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the<br>letter.<br><br>“Well, they’ve sent you a tidy sum,” said Berg, eying the heavy<br>purse that sank into the sofa. “As for us, Count, we get along on our<br>pay. I can tell you for myself...”<br><br>“I say, Berg, my dear fellow,” said Rostóv, “when you get a<br>letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk<br>everything over with, and I happen to be there, I’ll go at once, to<br>be out of your way! Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!” he<br>exclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking<br>amiably into his face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his<br>words, he added, “Don’t be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak<br>from my heart as to an old acquaintance.”<br><br>“Oh, don’t mention it, Count! I quite understand,” said Berg,<br>getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.<br><br>“Go across to our hosts: they invited you,” added Borís.<br><br>Berg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust,<br>stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples<br>upwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having<br>assured himself from the way Rostóv looked at it that his coat had been<br>noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.<br><br>“Oh dear, what a beast I am!” muttered Rostóv, as he read the<br>letter.<br><br>“Why?”<br><br>“Oh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have given them<br>such a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!” he repeated, flushing suddenly.<br>“Well, have you sent Gabriel for some wine? All right let’s have<br>some!”<br><br>In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation<br>to Bagratión which the old countess at Anna Mikháylovna’s advice had<br>obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking him to take<br>it to its destination and make use of it.<br><br>“What nonsense! Much I need it!” said Rostóv, throwing the letter<br>under the table.<br><br>“Why have you thrown that away?” asked Borís.<br><br>“It is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want it<br>for!”<br><br>“Why ‘What the devil’?” said Borís, picking it up and reading<br>the address. “This letter would be of great use to you.”<br><br>“I want nothing, and I won’t be anyone’s adjutant.”<br><br>“Why not?” inquired Borís.<br><br>“It’s a lackey’s job!”<br><br>“You are still the same dreamer, I see,” remarked Borís, shaking<br>his head.<br><br>“And you’re still the same diplomatist! But that’s not the<br>point... Come, how are you?” asked Rostóv.<br><br>“Well, as you see. So far everything’s all right, but I confess I<br>should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front.”<br><br>“Why?”<br><br>“Because when once a man starts on military service, he should try to<br>make as successful a career of it as possible.”<br><br>“Oh, that’s it!” said Rostóv, evidently thinking of something<br>else.<br><br>He looked intently and inquiringly into his friend’s eyes, evidently<br>trying in vain to find the answer to some question.<br><br>Old Gabriel brought in the wine.<br><br>“Shouldn’t we now send for Berg?” asked Borís. “He would drink<br>with you. I can’t.”<br><br>“Well, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?”<br>asked Rostóv, with a contemptuous smile.<br><br>“He is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow,” answered<br>Borís.<br><br>Again Rostóv looked intently into Borís’ eyes and sighed. Berg<br>returned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three<br>officers became animated. The Guardsmen told Rostóv of their march and<br>how they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They spoke<br>of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told<br>stories of his kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual, kept silent<br>when the subject did not relate to himself, but in connection with the<br>stories of the Grand Duke’s quick temper he related with gusto how in<br>Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter<br>made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of<br>a movement. With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke<br>had ridden up to him in a violent passion, shouting: “Arnauts!”<br>(“Arnauts” was the Tsarévich’s favorite expression when he was in<br>a rage) and called for the company commander.<br><br>“Would you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I knew<br>I was right. Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know the Army<br>Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lord’s<br>Prayer. So, Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and<br>so my conscience was at ease. I came forward....” (Berg stood up and<br>showed how he presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really<br>it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and<br>self-complacency than his did.) “Well, he stormed at me, as the saying<br>is, stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but<br>rather of death, as the saying is. ‘Albanians!’ and ‘devils!’<br>and ‘To Siberia!’” said Berg with a sagacious smile. “I knew I<br>was in the right so I kept silent; was not that best, Count?... ‘Hey,<br>are you dumb?’ he shouted. Still I remained silent. And what do you<br>think, Count? The next day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of<br>the Day. That’s what keeping one’s head means. That’s the way,<br>Count,” said Berg, lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke.<br><br>“Yes, that was fine,” said Rostóv, smiling.<br><br>But Borís noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and<br>skillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and where<br>he got his wound. This pleased Rostóv and he began talking about it,<br>and as he went on became more and more animated. He told them of his<br>Schön Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle<br>generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been,<br>as they have heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not<br>at all as it really was. Rostóv was a truthful young man and would on<br>no account have told a deliberate lie. He began his story meaning to<br>tell everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily,<br>and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood. If he had told the truth to his<br>hearers—who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had<br>formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear<br>just such a story—they would either not have believed him or, still<br>worse, would have thought that Rostóv was himself to blame since what<br>generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened<br>to him. He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and<br>that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as<br>he could from a Frenchman into the wood. Besides, to tell everything as<br>it really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort of<br>will to tell only what happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth,<br>and young people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story<br>of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like<br>a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his<br>saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on. And so he<br>told them all that.<br><br>In the middle of his story, just as he was saying: “You cannot imagine<br>what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,” Prince<br>Andrew, whom Borís was expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who<br>liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance<br>and being well disposed toward Borís, who had managed to please him the<br>day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent<br>with papers from Kutúzov to the Tsarévich, he looked in on Borís,<br>hoping to find him alone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line<br>recounting his military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure<br>that sort of man), he gave Borís a pleasant smile, frowned as with<br>half-closed eyes he looked at Rostóv, bowed slightly and wearily, and<br>sat down languidly on the sofa: he felt it unpleasant to have dropped<br>in on bad company. Rostóv flushed up on noticing this, but he did not<br>care, this was a mere stranger. Glancing, however, at Borís, he saw<br>that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line.<br><br>In spite of Prince Andrew’s disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of<br>the contempt with which Rostóv, from his fighting army point of view,<br>regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer<br>was evidently one, Rostóv felt confused, blushed, and became silent.<br>Borís inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without<br>indiscretion, one might ask about our plans.<br><br>“We shall probably advance,” replied Bolkónski, evidently reluctant<br>to say more in the presence of a stranger.<br><br>Berg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was<br>rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be<br>doubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could<br>give no opinion on such an important government order, and Berg laughed<br>gaily.<br><br>“As to your business,” Prince Andrew continued, addressing Borís,<br>“we will talk of it later” (and he looked round at Rostóv). “Come<br>to me after the review and we will do what is possible.”<br><br>And, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to Rostóv,<br>whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to<br>anger he did not condescend to notice, and said: “I think you were<br>talking of the Schön Grabern affair? Were you there?”<br><br>“I was there,” said Rostóv angrily, as if intending to insult the<br>aide-de-camp.<br><br>Bolkónski noticed the hussar’s state of mind, and it amused him. With<br>a slightly contemptuous smile, he said: “Yes, there are many stories<br>now told about that affair!”<br><br>“Yes, stories!” repeated Rostóv loudly, looking with eyes suddenly<br>grown furious, now at Borís, now at Bolkónski. “Yes, many stories!<br>But our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy’s<br>fire! Our stories have some weight, not like the stories of those<br>fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!”<br><br>“Of whom you imagine me to be one?” said Prince Andrew, with a quiet<br>and particularly amiable smile.<br><br>A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man’s<br>self-possession mingled at that moment in Rostóv’s soul.<br><br>“I am not talking about you,” he said, “I don’t know you and,<br>frankly, I don’t want to. I am speaking of the staff in general.”<br><br>“And I will tell you this,” Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of<br>quiet authority, “you wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with<br>you that it would be very easy to do so if you haven’t sufficient<br>self-respect, but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen.<br>In a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more<br>serious duel, and besides, Drubetskóy, who says he is an old friend<br>of yours, is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to<br>displease you. However,” he added rising, “you know my name and<br>where to find me, but don’t forget that I do not regard either myself<br>or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my<br>advice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on Friday after the review<br>I shall expect you, Drubetskóy. Au revoir!” exclaimed Prince Andrew,<br>and with a bow to them both he went out.<br><br>Only when Prince Andrew was gone did Rostóv think of what he ought to<br>have said. And he was still more angry at having omitted to say it. He<br>ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of Borís, rode<br>home. Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected<br>adjutant, or really let the matter drop, was the question that worried<br>him all the way. He thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at<br>seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by<br>his pistol, and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew<br>there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very<br>adjutant whom he so hated.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>The day after Rostóv had been to see Borís, a review was held of the<br>Austrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arrived from Russia and<br>those who had been campaigning under Kutúzov. The two Emperors,<br>the Russian with his heir the Tsarévich, and the Austrian with the<br>Archduke, inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men.<br><br>From early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up<br>on the field before the fortress. Now thousands of feet and bayonets<br>moved and halted at the officers’ command, turned with banners flying,<br>formed up at intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of<br>infantry in different uniforms; now was heard the rhythmic beat of<br>hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green braided<br>uniforms, with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan,<br>or gray horses; then again, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the<br>polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with<br>the smell of linstocks, came the artillery which crawled between the<br>infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position. Not only the<br>generals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn<br>in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and<br>wearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded<br>officers, but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and<br>his weapons clean and polished to the utmost, and every horse groomed<br>till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay<br>smooth—felt that no small matter was happening, but an important and<br>solemn affair. Every general and every soldier was conscious of his own<br>insignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and<br>yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that<br>enormous whole.<br><br>From early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten<br>o’clock all had been brought into due order. The ranks were drawn<br>up on the vast field. The whole army was extended in three lines: the<br>cavalry in front, behind it the artillery, and behind that again the<br>infantry.<br><br>A space like a street was left between each two lines of troops. The<br>three parts of that army were sharply distinguished: Kutúzov’s<br>fighting army (with the Pávlograds on the right flank of the front);<br>those recently arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the<br>line; and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in the same lines,<br>under one command, and in a like order.<br><br>Like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: “They’re coming!<br>They’re coming!” Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final<br>preparation swept over all the troops.<br><br>From the direction of Olmütz in front of them, a group was seen<br>approaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust<br>of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the<br>lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs. It<br>looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its<br>joy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice was heard shouting:<br>“Eyes front!” Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was<br>repeated by others from various sides and all became silent.<br><br>In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard. This<br>was the Emperors’ suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank, and the<br>trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march. It<br>seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as if the army<br>itself, rejoicing at the Emperors’ approach, had naturally burst into<br>music. Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor<br>Alexander was clearly heard. He gave the words of greeting, and the<br>first regiment roared “Hurrah!” so deafeningly, continuously, and<br>joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the<br>immensity of the power they constituted.<br><br>Rostóv, standing in the front lines of Kutúzov’s army which the Tsar<br>approached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in<br>that army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of<br>might, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this<br>triumph.<br><br>He felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass (and he<br>himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and water,<br>commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he could<br>not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word.<br><br>“Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!” thundered from all sides, one regiment<br>after another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then<br>“Hurrah!”... Then the general march, and again “Hurrah! Hurrah!”<br>growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.<br><br>Till the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility<br>seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive,<br>its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had<br>already passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices,<br>amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to<br>stone, hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but<br>symmetrically and above all freely, and in front of them two men—the<br>Emperors. Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that<br>whole mass of men was concentrated.<br><br>The handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse<br>Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his<br>pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyone’s<br>attention.<br><br>Rostóv was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had<br>recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within twenty<br>paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his<br>handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling of tenderness<br>and ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every<br>movement of the Tsar’s seemed to him enchanting.<br><br>Stopping in front of the Pávlograds, the Tsar said something in French<br>to the Austrian Emperor and smiled.<br><br>Seeing that smile, Rostóv involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still<br>stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show that love in<br>some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar<br>called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.<br><br>“Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?”<br>thought Rostóv. “I should die of happiness!”<br><br>The Tsar addressed the officers also: “I thank you all, gentlemen, I<br>thank you with my whole heart.” To Rostóv every word sounded like a<br>voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!<br><br>“You have earned the St. George’s standards and will be worthy of<br>them.”<br><br>“Oh, to die, to die for him,” thought Rostóv.<br><br>The Tsar said something more which Rostóv did not hear, and the<br>soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted “Hurrah!”<br><br>Rostóv too, bending over his saddle, shouted “Hurrah!” with all his<br>might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if<br>only to express his rapture fully.<br><br>The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.<br><br>“How can the Emperor be undecided?” thought Rostóv, but then even<br>this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything<br>else the Tsar did.<br><br>That hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar’s foot, in the narrow<br>pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay<br>mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he<br>moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp.<br>Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at<br>last only his white plumes were visible to Rostóv from amid the suites<br>that surrounded the Emperors.<br><br>Among the gentlemen of the suite, Rostóv noticed Bolkónski, sitting<br>his horse indolently and carelessly. Rostóv recalled their quarrel of<br>yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought<br>not to challenge Bolkónski. “Of course not!” he now thought. “Is<br>it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment? At a time of such<br>love, such rapture, and such self-sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels<br>and affronts matter? I love and forgive everybody now.”<br><br>When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began<br>a ceremonial march past him, and Rostóv on Bedouin, recently purchased<br>from Denísov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadron—that is,<br>alone and in full view of the Emperor.<br><br>Before he reached him, Rostóv, who was a splendid horseman, spurred<br>Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the<br>animal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his<br>tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperor’s eye<br>upon him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a high and graceful<br>action, as if flying through the air without touching the ground.<br><br>Rostóv himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling<br>himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but<br>blissful face “like a vewy devil,” as Denísov expressed it.<br><br>“Fine fellows, the Pávlograds!” remarked the Emperor.<br><br>“My God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire<br>this instant!” thought Rostóv.<br><br>When the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also<br>Kutúzov’s, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards,<br>about the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about<br>Bonaparte, and how badly the latter would fare now, especially if the<br>Essen corps arrived and Prussia took our side.<br><br>But the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander. His<br>every word and movement was described with ecstasy.<br><br>They all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against the<br>enemy under the Emperor’s command. Commanded by the Emperor himself<br>they could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might: so thought<br>Rostóv and most of the officers after the review.<br><br>All were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles<br>would have made them.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>The day after the review, Borís, in his best uniform and with his<br>comrade Berg’s best wishes for success, rode to Olmütz to see<br>Bolkónski, wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself<br>the best post he could—preferably that of adjutant to some important<br>personage, a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive.<br>“It is all very well for Rostóv, whose father sends him ten thousand<br>rubles at a time, to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not<br>be anyone’s lackey, but I who have nothing but my brains have to<br>make a career and must not miss opportunities, but must avail myself of<br>them!” he reflected.<br><br>He did not find Prince Andrew in Olmütz that day, but the appearance of<br>the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed<br>and the two Emperors were living with their suites, households, and<br>courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world.<br><br>He knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsman’s uniform, all these<br>exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages<br>with their plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military<br>men, seemed so immeasurably above him, an insignificant officer of the<br>Guards, that they not only did not wish to, but simply could not, be<br>aware of his existence. At the quarters of the commander in chief,<br>Kutúzov, where he inquired for Bolkónski, all the adjutants and even<br>the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a<br>great many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody<br>was heartily sick of them. In spite of this, or rather because of<br>it, next day, November 15, after dinner he again went to Olmütz and,<br>entering the house occupied by Kutúzov, asked for Bolkónski. Prince<br>Andrew was in and Borís was shown into a large hall probably formerly<br>used for dancing, but in which five beds now stood, and furniture of<br>various kinds: a table, chairs, and a clavichord. One adjutant, nearest<br>the door, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing.<br>Another, the red, stout Nesvítski, lay on a bed with his arms under his<br>head, laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him. A third was<br>playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on<br>the clavichord, sang the tune. Bolkónski was not there. None of these<br>gentlemen changed his position on seeing Borís. The one who was writing<br>and whom Borís addressed turned round crossly and told him Bolkónski<br>was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the<br>reception room if he wished to see him. Borís thanked him and went to<br>the reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals.<br><br>When he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously (with<br>that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, “If<br>it were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment”), was<br>listening to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very<br>erect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldier’s obsequious expression on his<br>purple face, reporting something.<br><br>“Very well, then, be so good as to wait,” said Prince Andrew to the<br>general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he affected<br>when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Borís, Prince<br>Andrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring<br>him to hear something more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful<br>smile.<br><br>At that moment Borís clearly realized what he had before surmised, that<br>in the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the<br>military code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, there was<br>another, more important, subordination, which made this tight-laced,<br>purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for<br>his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetskóy. More than<br>ever was Borís resolved to serve in future not according to the written<br>code, but under this unwritten law. He felt now that merely by having<br>been recommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen above the general<br>who at the front had the power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the<br>Guards. Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand.<br><br>“I am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing about<br>with Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions.<br>When Germans start being accurate, there’s no end to it!”<br><br>Borís smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to<br>as something generally known. But it was the first time he had heard<br>Weyrother’s name, or even the term “dispositions.”<br><br>“Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have<br>been thinking about you.”<br><br>“Yes, I was thinking”—for some reason Borís could not help<br>blushing—“of asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter from<br>Prince Kurágin about me. I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards<br>won’t be in action,” he added as if in apology.<br><br>“All right, all right. We’ll talk it over,” replied Prince Andrew.<br>“Only let me report this gentleman’s business, and I shall be at<br>your disposal.”<br><br>While Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general, that<br>gentleman—evidently not sharing Borís’ conception of the advantages<br>of the unwritten code of subordination—looked so fixedly at the<br>presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to<br>say to the adjutant that Borís felt uncomfortable. He turned away and<br>waited impatiently for Prince Andrew’s return from the commander in<br>chief’s room.<br><br>“You see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you,”<br>said Prince Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the<br>clavichord was. “It’s no use your going to the commander in chief.<br>He would say a lot of pleasant things, ask you to dinner” (“That<br>would not be bad as regards the unwritten code,” thought Borís),<br>“but nothing more would come of it. There will soon be a battalion of<br>us aides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is what we’ll do: I have<br>a good friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince<br>Dolgorúkov; and though you may not know it, the fact is that now<br>Kutúzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing. Everything is<br>now centered round the Emperor. So we will go to Dolgorúkov; I have to<br>go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you. We shall<br>see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you<br>somewhere nearer the sun.”<br><br>Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young<br>man and help him to worldly success. Under cover of obtaining help<br>of this kind for another, which from pride he would never accept for<br>himself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and<br>which attracted him. He very readily took up Borís’ cause and went<br>with him to Dolgorúkov.<br><br>It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmütz<br>occupied by the Emperors and their retinues.<br><br>That same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of<br>the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At that council, contrary<br>to the views of the old generals Kutúzov and Prince Schwartzenberg, it<br>had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte.<br>The council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied<br>by Borís arrived at the palace to find Dolgorúkov. Everyone at<br>headquarters was still under the spell of the day’s council, at which<br>the party of the young had triumphed. The voices of those who counseled<br>delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been<br>so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive<br>evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed<br>at the council—the coming battle and the victory that would certainly<br>result from it—no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past.<br>All the advantages were on our side. Our enormous forces, undoubtedly<br>superior to Napoleon’s, were concentrated in one place, the troops<br>inspired by the Emperors’ presence were eager for action. The<br>strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in<br>all its details to the Austrian General Weyrother: a lucky accident had<br>ordained that the Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the<br>very fields where the French had now to be fought; the adjacent<br>locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps, and Bonaparte,<br>evidently weakened, was undertaking nothing.<br><br>Dolgorúkov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just<br>returned from the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud<br>of the victory that had been gained. Prince Andrew introduced his<br>protégé, but Prince Dolgorúkov politely and firmly pressing his hand<br>said nothing to Borís and, evidently unable to suppress the thoughts<br>which were uppermost in his mind at that moment, addressed Prince Andrew<br>in French.<br><br>“Ah, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that<br>the one that will result from it will be as victorious! However, dear<br>fellow,” he said abruptly and eagerly, “I must confess to having<br>been unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother. What<br>exactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what<br>foresight for every eventuality, every possibility even to the smallest<br>detail! No, my dear fellow, no conditions better than our present ones<br>could have been devised. This combination of Austrian precision with<br>Russian valor—what more could be wished for?”<br><br>“So the attack is definitely resolved on?” asked Bolkónski.<br><br>“And do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has<br>decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received from him<br>today for the Emperor.” Dolgorúkov smiled significantly.<br><br>“Is that so? And what did he say?” inquired Bolkónski.<br><br>“What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to gain time.<br>I tell you he is in our hands, that’s certain! But what was most<br>amusing,” he continued, with a sudden, good-natured laugh, “was that<br>we could not think how to address the reply! If not as ‘Consul’<br>and of course not as ‘Emperor,’ it seemed to me it should be to<br>‘General Bonaparte.’”<br><br>“But between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General<br>Bonaparte, there is a difference,” remarked Bolkónski.<br><br>“That’s just it,” interrupted Dolgorúkov quickly, laughing.<br>“You know Bilíbin—he’s a very clever fellow. He suggested<br>addressing him as ‘Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.’”<br><br>Dolgorúkov laughed merrily.<br><br>“Only that?” said Bolkónski.<br><br>“All the same, it was Bilíbin who found a suitable form for the<br>address. He is a wise and clever fellow.”<br><br>“What was it?”<br><br>“To the Head of the French Government... Au chef du gouvernement<br>français,” said Dolgorúkov, with grave satisfaction. “Good,<br>wasn’t it?”<br><br>“Yes, but he will dislike it extremely,” said Bolkónski.<br><br>“Oh yes, very much! My brother knows him, he’s dined with him—the<br>present Emperor—more than once in Paris, and tells me he never met a<br>more cunning or subtle diplomatist—you know, a combination of French<br>adroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale about him and<br>Count Markóv? Count Markóv was the only man who knew how to handle<br>him. You know the story of the handkerchief? It is delightful!”<br><br>And the talkative Dolgorúkov, turning now to Borís, now to Prince<br>Andrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test Markóv, our ambassador,<br>purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking<br>at Markóv, probably expecting Markóv to pick it up for him, and how<br>Markóv immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without<br>touching Bonaparte’s.<br><br>“Delightful!” said Bolkónski. “But I have come to you, Prince,<br>as a petitioner on behalf of this young man. You see...” but<br>before Prince Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon<br>Dolgorúkov to the Emperor.<br><br>“Oh, what a nuisance,” said Dolgorúkov, getting up hurriedly and<br>pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Borís. “You know I should<br>be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young<br>man.” Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of<br>good-natured, sincere, and animated levity. “But you see... another<br>time!”<br><br>Borís was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers<br>as he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious that here<br>he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous<br>movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny,<br>obedient, and insignificant atom. They followed Prince Dolgorúkov out<br>into the corridor and met—coming out of the door of the Emperor’s<br>room by which Dolgorúkov had entered—a short man in civilian clothes<br>with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling<br>his face, gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression.<br>This short man nodded to Dolgorúkov as to an intimate friend and stared<br>at Prince Andrew with cool intensity, walking straight toward him and<br>evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way. Prince Andrew<br>did neither: a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other<br>turned away and went down the side of the corridor.<br><br>“Who was that?” asked Borís.<br><br>“He is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of<br>men—the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartorýski.... It<br>is such men as he who decide the fate of nations,” added Bolkónski<br>with a sigh he could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.<br><br>Next day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle of<br>Austerlitz, Borís was unable to see either Prince Andrew or Dolgorúkov<br>again and remained for a while with the Ismáylov regiment.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>At dawn on the sixteenth of November, Denísov’s squadron, in<br>which Nicholas Rostóv served and which was in Prince Bagratión’s<br>detachment, moved from the place where it had spent the night, advancing<br>into action as arranged, and after going behind other columns for<br>about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad. Rostóv saw the<br>Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry<br>battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals<br>Bagratión and Dolgorúkov ride past with their adjutants. All the fear<br>before action which he had experienced as previously, all the inner<br>struggle to conquer that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself<br>as a true hussar in this battle, had been wasted. Their squadron<br>remained in reserve and Nicholas Rostóv spent that day in a dull and<br>wretched mood. At nine in the morning, he heard firing in front and<br>shouts of hurrah, and saw wounded being brought back (there were not<br>many of them), and at last he saw how a whole detachment of French<br>cavalry was brought in, convoyed by a sótnya of Cossacks. Evidently the<br>affair was over and, though not big, had been a successful engagement.<br>The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory, of the<br>occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French<br>squadron. The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost, and<br>the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of<br>victory which was conveyed, not only by the tales of those who had taken<br>part in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers,<br>officers, generals, and adjutants, as they passed Rostóv going or<br>coming. And Nicholas, who had vainly suffered all the dread that<br>precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity, was all<br>the more depressed.<br><br>“Come here, Wostóv. Let’s dwink to dwown our gwief!” shouted<br>Denísov, who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some<br>food.<br><br>The officers gathered round Denísov’s canteen, eating and talking.<br><br>“There! They are bringing another!” cried one of the officers,<br>indicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by<br>two Cossacks.<br><br>One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had<br>taken from the prisoner.<br><br>“Sell us that horse!” Denísov called out to the Cossacks.<br><br>“If you like, your honor!”<br><br>The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner.<br>The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German<br>accent. He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when<br>he heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers,<br>addressing first one, then another. He said he would not have been<br>taken, it was not his fault but the corporal’s who had sent him to<br>seize some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were there.<br>And at every word he added: “But don’t hurt my little horse!” and<br>stroked the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he<br>was. Now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now,<br>imagining himself before his own officers, insisted on his soldierly<br>discipline and zeal in the service. He brought with him into our<br>rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which was<br>so alien to us.<br><br>The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rostóv, being the<br>richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it.<br><br>“But don’t hurt my little horse!” said the Alsatian good-naturedly<br>to Rostóv when the animal was handed over to the hussar.<br><br>Rostóv smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.<br><br>“Alley! Alley!” said the Cossack, touching the prisoner’s arm to<br>make him go on.<br><br>“The Emperor! The Emperor!” was suddenly heard among the hussars.<br><br>All began to run and bustle, and Rostóv saw coming up the road behind<br>him several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment everyone<br>was in his place, waiting.<br><br>Rostóv did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted.<br>Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood<br>amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every thought of<br>himself had vanished. He was filled with happiness at his nearness to<br>the Emperor. He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the<br>day he had lost. He was happy as a lover when the longed-for moment of<br>meeting arrives. Not daring to look round and without looking round, he<br>was ecstatically conscious of his approach. He felt it not only from the<br>sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade, but because as he drew<br>near everything grew brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more<br>festive around him. Nearer and nearer to Rostóv came that sun shedding<br>beams of mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself<br>enveloped in those beams, he heard his voice, that kindly, calm,<br>and majestic voice that was yet so simple! And as if in accord with<br>Rostóv’s feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard<br>the Emperor’s voice.<br><br>“The Pávlograd hussars?” he inquired.<br><br>“The reserves, sire!” replied a voice, a very human one compared to<br>that which had said: “The Pávlograd hussars?”<br><br>The Emperor drew level with Rostóv and halted. Alexander’s face was<br>even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review. It<br>shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested<br>the liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was the face<br>of the majestic Emperor. Casually, while surveying the squadron, the<br>Emperor’s eyes met Rostóv’s and rested on them for not more than<br>two seconds. Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in<br>Rostóv’s soul (it seemed to Rostóv that he understood everything),<br>at any rate his light-blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into<br>Rostóv’s face. A gentle, mild light poured from them. Then all at<br>once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left<br>foot, and galloped on.<br><br>The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the<br>battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve<br>o’clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped<br>toward the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars, several<br>adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action.<br><br>This battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was<br>represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the<br>Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over<br>the battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were<br>retreating against their will. A few minutes after the Emperor had<br>passed, the Pávlograd division was ordered to advance. In Wischau<br>itself, a petty German town, Rostóv saw the Emperor again. In the<br>market place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the<br>Emperor’s arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there<br>had not been time to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his suite<br>of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a<br>different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and bending<br>to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked<br>at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head. The<br>wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity<br>to the Emperor shocked Rostóv. Rostóv saw how the Emperor’s rather<br>round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his<br>left foot began convulsively tapping the horse’s side with the spur,<br>and how the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not<br>stir. An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to<br>place him on a stretcher that had been brought. The soldier groaned.<br><br>“Gently, gently! Can’t you do it more gently?” said the Emperor<br>apparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.<br><br>Rostóv saw tears filling the Emperor’s eyes and heard him, as he was<br>riding away, say to Czartorýski: “What a terrible thing war is: what<br>a terrible thing! Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!”<br><br>The troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight<br>of the enemy’s lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us<br>at the least firing. The Emperor’s gratitude was announced to the<br>vanguard, rewards were promised, and the men received a double ration of<br>vodka. The campfires crackled and the soldiers’ songs resounded<br>even more merrily than on the previous night. Denísov celebrated his<br>promotion to the rank of major, and Rostóv, who had already drunk<br>enough, at the end of the feast proposed the Emperor’s health. “Not<br>‘our Sovereign, the Emperor,’ as they say at official dinners,”<br>said he, “but the health of our Sovereign, that good, enchanting, and<br>great man! Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the<br>French!”<br><br>“If we fought before,” he said, “not letting the French pass, as<br>at Schön Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front? We<br>will all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not<br>saying it right, I have drunk a good deal—but that is how I feel, and<br>so do you too! To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!”<br><br>“Hurrah!” rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.<br><br>And the old cavalry captain, Kírsten, shouted enthusiastically and no<br>less sincerely than the twenty-year-old Rostóv.<br><br>When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, Kírsten filled<br>others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the<br>soldiers’ bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest<br>showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light<br>of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.<br><br>“Lads! here’s to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over<br>our enemies! Hurrah!” he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussar’s<br>baritone.<br><br>The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.<br><br>Late that night, when all had separated, Denísov with his short hand<br>patted his favorite, Rostóv, on the shoulder.<br><br>“As there’s no one to fall in love with on campaign, he’s fallen<br>in love with the Tsar,” he said.<br><br>“Denísov, don’t make fun of it!” cried Rostóv. “It is such a<br>lofty, beautiful feeling, such a...”<br><br>“I believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...”<br><br>“No, you don’t understand!”<br><br>And Rostóv got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of<br>what happiness it would be to die—not in saving the Emperor’s life<br>(he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his<br>eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian<br>arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to<br>experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle<br>of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in<br>love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the<br>Russian arms.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician,<br>was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and among the troops<br>near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell. He ate nothing and<br>had slept badly that night, those around him reported. The cause of this<br>indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by<br>the sight of the killed and wounded.<br><br>At daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with<br>a flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was<br>brought into Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. The<br>Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. At midday<br>he was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with<br>Prince Dolgorúkov to the advanced post of the French army.<br><br>It was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander<br>a meeting with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, a<br>personal interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince<br>Dolgorúkov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate<br>with Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were<br>actuated by a real desire for peace.<br><br>Toward evening Dolgorúkov came back, went straight to the Tsar, and<br>remained alone with him for a long time.<br><br>On the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced two<br>days’ march and the enemy’s outposts after a brief interchange<br>of shots retreated. In the highest army circles from midday on the<br>nineteenth, a great, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till<br>the morning of the twentieth, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz<br>was fought.<br><br>Till midday on the nineteenth, the activity—the eager talk, running to<br>and fro, and dispatching of adjutants—was confined to the Emperor’s<br>headquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this activity reached<br>Kutúzov’s headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns.<br>By evening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the<br>army, and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole<br>eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of<br>voices, and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles<br>long.<br><br>The concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperor’s<br>headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that<br>followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower<br>clock. One wheel slowly moved, another was set in motion, and a third,<br>and wheels began to revolve faster and faster, levers and cogwheels to<br>work, chimes to play, figures to pop out, and the hands to advance with<br>regular motion as a result of all that activity.<br><br>Just as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military<br>machine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as<br>indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted<br>to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet<br>reached. Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and<br>the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a<br>neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared<br>to remain so for a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever<br>catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins<br>in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.<br><br>Just as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innumerable<br>wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the<br>hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated human<br>activities of 160,000 Russians and French—all their passions, desires,<br>remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and<br>enthusiasm—was only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the<br>so-called battle of the three Emperors—that is to say, a slow movement<br>of the hand on the dial of human history.<br><br>Prince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the<br>commander in chief.<br><br>At six in the evening, Kutúzov went to the Emperor’s headquarters<br>and after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand<br>marshal of the court, Count Tolstóy.<br><br>Bolkónski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the<br>coming action from Dolgorúkov. He felt that Kutúzov was upset<br>and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were<br>dissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperor’s headquarters<br>everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do<br>not know: he therefore wished to speak to Dolgorúkov.<br><br>“Well, how d’you do, my dear fellow?” said Dolgorúkov, who was<br>sitting at tea with Bilíbin. “The fete is for tomorrow. How is your<br>old fellow? Out of sorts?”<br><br>“I won’t say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be<br>heard.”<br><br>“But they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he<br>talks sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte<br>fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible.”<br><br>“Yes, you have seen him?” said Prince Andrew. “Well, what is<br>Bonaparte like? How did he impress you?”<br><br>“Yes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as<br>a general engagement,” repeated Dolgorúkov, evidently prizing this<br>general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with<br>Napoleon. “If he weren’t afraid of a battle why did he ask for that<br>interview? Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is<br>so contrary to his method of conducting war? Believe me, he is afraid,<br>afraid of a general battle. His hour has come! Mark my words!”<br><br>“But tell me, what is he like, eh?” said Prince Andrew again.<br><br>“He is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call<br>him ‘Your Majesty,’ but who, to his chagrin, got no title from<br>me! That’s the sort of man he is, and nothing more,” replied<br>Dolgorúkov, looking round at Bilíbin with a smile.<br><br>“Despite my great respect for old Kutúzov,” he continued, “we<br>should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him<br>a chance to escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in<br>our hands! No, we mustn’t forget Suvórov and his rule—not to put<br>yourself in a position to be attacked, but yourself to attack. Believe<br>me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all<br>the experience of old Cunctators.”<br><br>“But in what position are we going to attack him? I have been at the<br>outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are<br>situated,” said Prince Andrew.<br><br>He wished to explain to Dolgorúkov a plan of attack he had himself<br>formed.<br><br>“Oh, that is all the same,” Dolgorúkov said quickly, and getting up<br>he spread a map on the table. “All eventualities have been foreseen.<br>If he is standing before Brünn...”<br><br>And Prince Dolgorúkov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother’s<br>plan of a flanking movement.<br><br>Prince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which might<br>have been as good as Weyrother’s, but for the disadvantage that<br>Weyrother’s had already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrew began<br>to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan,<br>Prince Dolgorúkov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not<br>at the map, but at Prince Andrew’s face.<br><br>“There will be a council of war at Kutúzov’s tonight, though; you<br>can say all this there,” remarked Dolgorúkov.<br><br>“I will do so,” said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.<br><br>“Whatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?” said Bilíbin, who,<br>till then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and<br>now was evidently ready with a joke. “Whether tomorrow brings<br>victory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except your<br>Kutúzov, there is not a single Russian in command of a column! The<br>commanders are: Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de<br>Lichtenstein, le Prince, de Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on<br>like all those Polish names.”<br><br>“Be quiet, backbiter!” said Dolgorúkov. “It is not true; there<br>are now two Russians, Milorádovich, and Dokhtúrov, and there would be<br>a third, Count Arakchéev, if his nerves were not too weak.”<br><br>“However, I think General Kutúzov has come out,” said Prince<br>Andrew. “I wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!” he added and<br>went out after shaking hands with Dolgorúkov and Bilíbin.<br><br>On the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kutúzov,<br>who was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of tomorrow’s<br>battle.<br><br>Kutúzov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, replied:<br>“I think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count Tolstóy and<br>asked him to tell the Emperor. What do you think he replied? ‘But, my<br>dear general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after military<br>matters yourself!’ Yes... That was the answer I got!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>Shortly after nine o’clock that evening, Weyrother drove with his<br>plans to Kutúzov’s quarters where the council of war was to be<br>held. All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in<br>chief’s and with the exception of Prince Bagratión, who declined to<br>come, were all there at the appointed time.<br><br>Weyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his<br>eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied<br>and drowsy Kutúzov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and<br>president of the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt himself to be<br>at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable. He was<br>like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart. Whether he was<br>pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at<br>headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead<br>to. Weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemy’s picket<br>line to reconnoiter personally, and twice to the Emperors, Russian and<br>Austrian, to report and explain, and to his headquarters where he had<br>dictated the dispositions in German, and now, much exhausted, he arrived<br>at Kutúzov’s.<br><br>He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the<br>commander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly,<br>without looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to<br>questions put to him. He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful,<br>weary, and distracted air, though at the same time he was haughty and<br>self-confident.<br><br>Kutúzov was occupying a nobleman’s castle of modest dimensions near<br>Ostralitz. In the large drawing room which had become the commander<br>in chief’s office were gathered Kutúzov himself, Weyrother, and the<br>members of the council of war. They were drinking tea, and only awaited<br>Prince Bagratión to begin the council. At last Bagratión’s orderly<br>came with the news that the prince could not attend. Prince Andrew came<br>in to inform the commander in chief of this and, availing himself<br>of permission previously given him by Kutúzov to be present at the<br>council, he remained in the room.<br><br>“Since Prince Bagratión is not coming, we may begin,” said<br>Weyrother, hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on<br>which an enormous map of the environs of Brünn was spread out.<br><br>Kutúzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over<br>his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair,<br>with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms. At the sound<br>of Weyrother’s voice, he opened his one eye with an effort.<br><br>“Yes, yes, if you please! It is already late,” said he, and nodding<br>his head he let it droop and again closed his eye.<br><br>If at first the members of the council thought that Kutúzov was<br>pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that<br>followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed<br>by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for<br>the dispositions or anything else—he was engaged in satisfying the<br>irresistible human need for sleep. He really was asleep. Weyrother, with<br>the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at Kutúzov and,<br>having convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in<br>a loud, monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the<br>impending battle, under a heading which he also read out:<br><br>“Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and<br>Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805.”<br><br>The dispositions were very complicated and difficult. They began as<br>follows:<br><br>“As the enemy’s left wing rests on wooded hills and his right<br>extends along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there,<br>while we, on the other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his<br>right, it is advantageous to attack the enemy’s latter wing especially<br>if we occupy the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we<br>can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between<br>Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest, avoiding the defiles of<br>Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the enemy’s front. For this<br>object it is necessary that... The first column marches... The second<br>column marches... The third column marches...” and so on, read<br>Weyrother.<br><br>The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions.<br>The tall, fair-haired General Buxhöwden stood, leaning his back against<br>the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen<br>or even to wish to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite Weyrother,<br>with his glistening wide-open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache<br>twisted upwards, sat the ruddy Milorádovich in a military pose, his<br>elbows turned outwards, his hands on his knees, and his shoulders<br>raised. He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Weyrother’s face,<br>and only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished<br>reading. Then Milorádovich looked round significantly at the other<br>generals. But one could not tell from that significant look whether he<br>agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements. Next<br>to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a subtle smile that never left<br>his typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading,<br>gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners<br>a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. In the middle of one of the<br>longest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised<br>his head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his<br>thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something. But the<br>Austrian general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his<br>elbows, as if to say: “You can tell me your views later, but now be so<br>good as to look at the map and listen.” Langeron lifted his eyes with<br>an expression of perplexity, turned round to Milorádovich as if seeking<br>an explanation, but meeting the latter’s impressive but meaningless<br>gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.<br><br>“A geography lesson!” he muttered as if to himself, but loud enough<br>to be heard.<br><br>Przebyszéwski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his<br>hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in<br>attention. Dohktúrov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with<br>an assiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map<br>conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality. He<br>asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard<br>and the difficult names of villages. Weyrother complied and Dohktúrov<br>noted them down.<br><br>When the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron again<br>brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at<br>anyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry out<br>such a plan in which the enemy’s position was assumed to be known,<br>whereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement.<br>Langeron’s objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief<br>aim was to show General Weyrother—who had read his dispositions with<br>as much self-confidence as if he were addressing school children—that<br>he had to do, not with fools, but with men who could teach him something<br>in military matters.<br><br>When the monotonous sound of Weyrother’s voice ceased, Kutúzov opened<br>his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel<br>is interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking,<br>“So you are still at that silly business!” quickly closed his eye<br>again, and let his head sink still lower.<br><br>Langeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrother’s vanity<br>as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily<br>attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this<br>plan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a firm and<br>contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections<br>be they what they might.<br><br>“If he could attack us, he would have done so today,” said he.<br><br>“So you think he is powerless?” said Langeron.<br><br>“He has forty thousand men at most,” replied Weyrother, with the<br>smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of<br>a case.<br><br>“In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack,” said<br>Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round for support<br>to Milorádovich who was near him.<br><br>But Milorádovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything<br>rather than of what the generals were disputing about.<br><br>“Ma foi!” said he, “tomorrow we shall see all that on the<br>battlefield.”<br><br>Weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was<br>strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to<br>have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of, but<br>had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of.<br><br>“The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from<br>his camp,” said he. “What does that mean? Either he is retreating,<br>which is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position.”<br>(He smiled ironically.) “But even if he also took up a position in<br>the Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our<br>arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same.”<br><br>“How is that?...” began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting<br>an opportunity to express his doubts.<br><br>Kutúzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at the<br>generals.<br><br>“Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow—or rather for today, for<br>it is past midnight—cannot now be altered,” said he. “You have<br>heard them, and we shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there is<br>nothing more important...” he paused, “than to have a good sleep.”<br><br>He moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was past<br>midnight. Prince Andrew went out.<br><br>The council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to<br>express his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy<br>impression. Whether Dolgorúkov and Weyrother, or Kutúzov, Langeron,<br>and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack, were<br>right—he did not know. “But was it really not possible for Kutúzov<br>to state his views plainly to the Emperor? Is it possible that on<br>account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives,<br>and my life, my life,” he thought, “must be risked?”<br><br>“Yes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow,” he<br>thought. And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of most<br>distant, most intimate, memories rose in his imagination: he remembered<br>his last parting from his father and his wife; he remembered the days<br>when he first loved her. He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for<br>her and for himself, and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he<br>went out of the hut in which he was billeted with Nesvítski and began<br>to walk up and down before it.<br><br>The night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed<br>mysteriously. “Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow!” he thought. “Tomorrow<br>everything may be over for me! All these memories will be no more, none<br>of them will have any meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even certainly,<br>I have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have to show all<br>I can do.” And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the<br>concentration of fighting at one point, and the hesitation of all the<br>commanders. And then that happy moment, that Toulon for which he had<br>so long waited, presents itself to him at last. He firmly and clearly<br>expresses his opinion to Kutúzov, to Weyrother, and to the Emperors.<br>All are struck by the justness of his views, but no one undertakes to<br>carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a division—stipulates that no<br>one is to interfere with his arrangements—leads his division to<br>the decisive point, and gains the victory alone. “But death and<br>suffering?” suggested another voice. Prince Andrew, however, did not<br>answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs. The dispositions<br>for the next battle are planned by him alone. Nominally he is only an<br>adjutant on Kutúzov’s staff, but he does everything alone. The next<br>battle is won by him alone. Kutúzov is removed and he is appointed...<br>“Well and then?” asked the other voice. “If before that you are<br>not ten times wounded, killed, or betrayed, well... what then?...”<br>“Well then,” Prince Andrew answered himself, “I don’t know<br>what will happen and don’t want to know, and can’t, but if I want<br>this—want glory, want to be known to men, want to be loved by them, it<br>is not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that and live only<br>for that. Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone, but, oh God!<br>what am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men’s esteem? Death,<br>wounds, the loss of family—I fear nothing. And precious and dear<br>as many persons are to me—father, sister, wife—those dearest to<br>me—yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would give them all at<br>once for a moment of glory, of triumph over men, of love from men I<br>don’t know and never shall know, for the love of these men here,” he<br>thought, as he listened to voices in Kutúzov’s courtyard. The voices<br>were those of the orderlies who were packing up; one voice, probably a<br>coachman’s, was teasing Kutúzov’s old cook whom Prince Andrew knew,<br>and who was called Tit. He was saying, “Tit, I say, Tit!”<br><br>“Well?” returned the old man.<br><br>“Go, Tit, thresh a bit!” said the wag.<br><br>“Oh, go to the devil!” called out a voice, drowned by the laughter<br>of the orderlies and servants.<br><br>“All the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I<br>value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this<br>mist!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>That same night, Rostóv was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front<br>of Bagratión’s detachment. His hussars were placed along the line<br>in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the<br>sleepiness that kept coming over him. An enormous space, with our<br>army’s campfires dimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind him;<br>in front of him was misty darkness. Rostóv could see nothing, peer as<br>he would into that foggy distance: now something gleamed gray, now there<br>was something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy<br>ought to be, now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes. His<br>eyes kept closing, and in his fancy appeared—now the Emperor, now<br>Denísov, and now Moscow memories—and he again hurriedly opened his<br>eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was<br>riding, and sometimes, when he came within six paces of them, the<br>black figures of hussars, but in the distance was still the same misty<br>darkness. “Why not?... It might easily happen,” thought Rostóv,<br>“that the Emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to any<br>other officer; he’ll say: ‘Go and find out what’s there.’ There<br>are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance<br>way and attaching him to himself! What if he gave me a place near him?<br>Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would<br>unmask his deceivers!” And in order to realize vividly his love<br>devotion to the sovereign, Rostóv pictured to himself an enemy or a<br>deceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom<br>he would slap in the face before the Emperor. Suddenly a distant shout<br>aroused him. He started and opened his eyes.<br><br>“Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and<br>watchword—shaft, Olmütz. What a nuisance that our squadron will be in<br>reserve tomorrow,” he thought. “I’ll ask leave to go to the front,<br>this may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor. It won’t be long<br>now before I am off duty. I’ll take another turn and when I get back<br>I’ll go to the general and ask him.” He readjusted himself in the<br>saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars. It<br>seemed to him that it was getting lighter. To the left he saw a sloping<br>descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a<br>wall. On this knoll there was a white patch that Rostóv could not at<br>all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some<br>unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought something moved on<br>that white spot. “I expect it’s snow... that spot... a spot—une<br>tache,” he thought. “There now... it’s not a tache... Natásha...<br>sister, black eyes... Na... tasha... (Won’t she be surprised when<br>I tell her how I’ve seen the Emperor?) Natásha... take my<br>sabretache...”—“Keep to the right, your honor, there are bushes<br>here,” came the voice of an hussar, past whom Rostóv was riding in<br>the act of falling asleep. Rostóv lifted his head that had sunk almost<br>to his horse’s mane and pulled up beside the hussar. He was succumbing<br>to irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness. “But what was I<br>thinking? I mustn’t forget. How shall I speak to the Emperor? No,<br>that’s not it—that’s tomorrow. Oh yes! Natásha... sabretache...<br>saber them... Whom? The hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches. Along<br>the Tverskáya Street rode the hussar with mustaches... I thought about<br>him too, just opposite Gúryev’s house... Old Gúryev.... Oh, but<br>Denísov’s a fine fellow. But that’s all nonsense. The chief thing<br>is that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me and wished to say<br>something, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared not. But that’s<br>nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the important thing I<br>was thinking of. Yes, Na-tásha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes! That’s<br>right!” And his head once more sank to his horse’s neck. All at once<br>it seemed to him that he was being fired at. “What? What? What?... Cut<br>them down! What?...” said Rostóv, waking up. At the moment he opened<br>his eyes he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the long-drawn<br>shouts of thousands of voices. His horse and the horse of the hussar<br>near him pricked their ears at these shouts. Over there, where the<br>shouting came from, a fire flared up and went out again, then another,<br>and all along the French line on the hill fires flared up and the<br>shouting grew louder and louder. Rostóv could hear the sound of French<br>words but could not distinguish them. The din of many voices was too<br>great; all he could hear was: “ahahah!” and “rrrr!”<br><br>“What’s that? What do you make of it?” said Rostóv to the hussar<br>beside him. “That must be the enemy’s camp!”<br><br>The hussar did not reply.<br><br>“Why, don’t you hear it?” Rostóv asked again, after waiting for a<br>reply.<br><br>“Who can tell, your honor?” replied the hussar reluctantly.<br><br>“From the direction, it must be the enemy,” repeated Rostóv.<br><br>“It may be he or it may be nothing,” muttered the hussar. “It’s<br>dark... Steady!” he cried to his fidgeting horse.<br><br>Rostóv’s horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground,<br>pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting<br>grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army<br>of several thousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and<br>farther, probably along the line of the French camp. Rostóv no longer<br>wanted to sleep. The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a<br>stimulating effect on him. “Vive l’Empereur! l’Empereur!” he now<br>heard distinctly.<br><br>“They can’t be far off, probably just beyond the stream,” he said<br>to the hussar beside him.<br><br>The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily. The sound<br>of horse’s hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was<br>heard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars<br>suddenly appeared, looming huge as an elephant.<br><br>“Your honor, the generals!” said the sergeant, riding up to Rostóv.<br><br>Rostóv, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode with<br>the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line.<br>One was on a white horse. Prince Bagratión and Prince Dolgorúkov with<br>their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the<br>lights and shouts in the enemy’s camp. Rostóv rode up to Bagratión,<br>reported to him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the<br>generals were saying.<br><br>“Believe me,” said Prince Dolgorúkov, addressing Bagratión, “it<br>is nothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to<br>kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us.”<br><br>“Hardly,” said Bagratión. “I saw them this evening on that<br>knoll; if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too....<br>Officer!” said Bagratión to Rostóv, “are the enemy’s skirmishers<br>still there?”<br><br>“They were there this evening, but now I don’t know, your<br>excellency. Shall I go with some of my hussars to see?” replied<br>Rostóv.<br><br>Bagratión stopped and, before replying, tried to see Rostóv’s face<br>in the mist.<br><br>“Well, go and see,” he said, after a pause.<br><br>“Yes, sir.”<br><br>Rostóv spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fédchenko and two other<br>hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction<br>from which the shouting came. He felt both frightened and pleased to be<br>riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty<br>distance where no one had been before him. Bagratión called to him from<br>the hill not to go beyond the stream, but Rostóv pretended not to hear<br>him and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes<br>for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes.<br>Having descended the hill at a trot, he no longer saw either our own or<br>the enemy’s fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudly<br>and distinctly. In the valley he saw before him something like a river,<br>but when he reached it he found it was a road. Having come out onto<br>the road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or<br>cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside. To keep to the<br>road which gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it<br>would be easier to see people coming along it. “Follow me!” said he,<br>crossed the road, and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the<br>point where the French pickets had been standing that evening.<br><br>“Your honor, there he is!” cried one of the hussars behind him. And<br>before Rostóv had time to make out what the black thing was that had<br>suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report,<br>and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed<br>out of hearing. Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan.<br>Rostóv turned his horse and galloped back. Four more reports followed<br>at intervals, and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in<br>different tones. Rostóv reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen,<br>like his own, at the firing, and went back at a footpace. “Well, some<br>more! Some more!” a merry voice was saying in his soul. But no more<br>shots came.<br><br>Only when approaching Bagratión did Rostóv let his horse gallop again,<br>and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.<br><br>Dolgorúkov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had<br>only lit fires to deceive us.<br><br>“What does that prove?” he was saying as Rostóv rode up. “They<br>might retreat and leave the pickets.”<br><br>“It’s plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince,” said<br>Bagratión. “Wait till tomorrow morning, we’ll find out everything<br>tomorrow.”<br><br>“The picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was<br>in the evening,” reported Rostóv, stooping forward with his hand at<br>the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his<br>ride and especially by the sound of the bullets.<br><br>“Very good, very good,” said Bagratión. “Thank you, officer.”<br><br>“Your excellency,” said Rostóv, “may I ask a favor?”<br><br>“What is it?”<br><br>“Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask to be attached<br>to the first squadron?”<br><br>“What’s your name?”<br><br>“Count Rostóv.”<br><br>“Oh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me.”<br><br>“Count Ilyá Rostóv’s son?” asked Dolgorúkov.<br><br>But Rostóv did not reply.<br><br>“Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?”<br><br>“I will give the order.”<br><br>“Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the<br>Emperor,” thought Rostóv.<br><br>“Thank God!”<br><br>The fires and shouting in the enemy’s army were occasioned by the fact<br>that while Napoleon’s proclamation was being read to the troops the<br>Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The soldiers, on seeing him,<br>lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, “Vive l’Empereur!”<br>Napoleon’s proclamation was as follows:<br><br>Soldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the<br>Austrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at<br>Hollabrünn and have pursued ever since to this place. The position we<br>occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round me on<br>the right they will expose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will myself direct<br>your battalions. I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual<br>valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemy’s ranks, but should<br>victory be in doubt, even for a moment, you will see your Emperor<br>exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy, for there must be no<br>doubt of victory, especially on this day when what is at stake is the<br>honor of the French infantry, so necessary to the honor of our nation.<br><br>Do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let every<br>man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings<br>of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! This victory will<br>conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters, where fresh<br>French troops who are being raised in France will join us, and the peace<br>I shall conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself.<br><br>NAPOLEON<br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>At five in the morning it was still quite dark. The troops of the<br>center, the reserves, and Bagratión’s right flank had not yet moved,<br>but on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery,<br>which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French<br>right flank and drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan,<br>were already up and astir. The smoke of the campfires, into which they<br>were throwing everything superfluous, made the eyes smart. It was cold<br>and dark. The officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting, the<br>soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to<br>warm themselves, gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the<br>remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they<br>did not want or could not carry away with them. Austrian column guides<br>were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds<br>of the advance. As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near<br>a commanding officer’s quarters, the regiment began to move: the<br>soldiers ran from the fires, thrust their pipes into their boots, their<br>bags into the carts, got their muskets ready, and formed rank. The<br>officers buttoned up their coats, buckled on their swords and pouches,<br>and moved along the ranks shouting. The train drivers and orderlies<br>harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads. The adjutants and<br>battalion and regimental commanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave<br>final instructions, orders, and commissions to the baggage men<br>who remained behind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet<br>resounded. The column moved forward without knowing where and unable,<br>from the masses around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see<br>either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going.<br><br>A soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as<br>much as a sailor is by his ship. However far he has walked, whatever<br>strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, just as a sailor is<br>always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so<br>the soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same ranks, the<br>same sergeant major Iván Mítrich, the same company dog Jack, and the<br>same commanders. The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which<br>his ship is sailing, but on the day of battle—heaven knows how and<br>whence—a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral<br>atmosphere of an army, announcing the approach of something decisive<br>and solemn, and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the day of<br>battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their<br>regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning<br>what is going on around them.<br><br>The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could<br>not see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level<br>ground like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any side, one might<br>encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off. But the columns advanced<br>for a long time, always in the same fog, descending and ascending hills,<br>avoiding gardens and enclosures, going over new and unknown ground, and<br>nowhere encountering the enemy. On the contrary, the soldiers became<br>aware that in front, behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns<br>were moving in the same direction. Every soldier felt glad to know that<br>to the unknown place where he was going, many more of our men were going<br>too.<br><br>“There now, the Kúrskies have also gone past,” was being said in<br>the ranks.<br><br>“It’s wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last<br>night I looked at the campfires and there was no end of them. A regular<br>Moscow!”<br><br>Though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to<br>the men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of<br>humor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not exert themselves<br>to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders), yet the troops<br>marched gaily, as they always do when going into action, especially to<br>an attack. But when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog,<br>the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness<br>of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks. How such<br>a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define, but it<br>certainly is communicated very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly,<br>and irrepressibly, as water does in a creek. Had the Russian army been<br>alone without any allies, it might perhaps have been a long time before<br>this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction, but as<br>it was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid<br>Germans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been<br>occasioned by the sausage eaters.<br><br>“Why have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we already come up<br>against the French?”<br><br>“No, one can’t hear them. They’d be firing if we had.”<br><br>“They were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand in<br>the middle of a field without rhyme or reason. It’s all those damned<br>Germans’ muddling! What stupid devils!”<br><br>“Yes, I’d send them on in front, but no fear, they’re crowding up<br>behind. And now here we stand hungry.”<br><br>“I say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry are blocking the<br>way,” said an officer.<br><br>“Ah, those damned Germans! They don’t know their own country!”<br>said another.<br><br>“What division are you?” shouted an adjutant, riding up.<br><br>“The Eighteenth.”<br><br>“Then why are you here? You should have gone on long ago, now you<br>won’t get there till evening.”<br><br>“What stupid orders! They don’t themselves know what they are<br>doing!” said the officer and rode off.<br><br>Then a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.<br><br>“Tafa-lafa! But what he’s jabbering no one can make out,” said a<br>soldier, mimicking the general who had ridden away. “I’d shoot them,<br>the scoundrels!”<br><br>“We were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we haven’t got<br>halfway. Fine orders!” was being repeated on different sides.<br><br>And the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to<br>turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the<br>Germans.<br><br>The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was<br>moving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center<br>was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all<br>ordered to turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in<br>front of the infantry, who had to wait.<br><br>At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a<br>Russian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be<br>halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to<br>blame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited. After<br>an hour’s delay they at last moved on, descending the hill. The fog<br>that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below, where they<br>were descending. In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another,<br>at first irregularly at varying intervals—trata...tat—and then more<br>and more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream<br>began.<br><br>Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having<br>stumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their<br>commanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through<br>the ranks, and above all being unable to see anything in front or around<br>them in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy<br>lazily and advanced and again halted, receiving no timely orders from<br>the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown<br>surroundings unable to find their own regiments. In this way the action<br>began for the first, second, and third columns, which had gone down into<br>the valley. The fourth column, with which Kutúzov was, stood on the<br>Pratzen Heights.<br><br>Below, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog; on the<br>higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was<br>going on in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed,<br>six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one<br>knew till after eight o’clock.<br><br>It was nine o’clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea<br>down below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon<br>stood with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was<br>a clear blue sky, and the sun’s vast orb quivered like a huge hollow,<br>crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist. The whole French<br>army, and even Napoleon himself with his staff, were not on the far side<br>of the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we<br>intended to take up our position and begin the action, but were on this<br>side, so close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could<br>distinguish a mounted man from one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak<br>which he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab<br>horse a little in front of his marshals. He gazed silently at the hills<br>which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian<br>troops were moving in the distance, and he listened to the sounds of<br>firing in the valley. Not a single muscle of his face—which in those<br>days was still thin—moved. His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on<br>one spot. His predictions were being justified. Part of the Russian<br>force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes<br>and part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack<br>and regarded as the key to the position. He saw over the mist that in<br>a hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian<br>columns, their bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one<br>direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into<br>the mist. From information he had received the evening before, from the<br>sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night,<br>by the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, and from all<br>indications, he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away<br>in front of them, and that the columns moving near Pratzen constituted<br>the center of the Russian army, and that that center was already<br>sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked. But still he did not<br>begin the engagement.<br><br>Today was a great day for him—the anniversary of his coronation.<br>Before dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and<br>in good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field<br>in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything<br>succeeds. He sat motionless, looking at the heights visible above<br>the mist, and his cold face wore that special look of confident,<br>self-complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily<br>in love. The marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his<br>attention. He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, now at the sun floating<br>up out of the mist.<br><br>When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist were<br>aglow with dazzling light—as if he had only awaited this to begin the<br>action—he drew the glove from his shapely white hand, made a sign<br>with it to the marshals, and ordered the action to begin. The marshals,<br>accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in different directions, and<br>a few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly<br>toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by<br>Russian troops moving down the valley to their left.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>At eight o’clock Kutúzov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth<br>column, Milorádovich’s, the one that was to take the place of<br>Przebyszéwski’s and Langeron’s columns which had already gone down<br>into the valley. He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave<br>them the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to lead<br>that column himself. When he had reached the village of Pratzen he<br>halted. Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense number forming the<br>commander in chief’s suite. He was in a state of suppressed excitement<br>and irritation, though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of<br>a long-awaited moment. He was firmly convinced that this was the day of<br>his Toulon, or his bridge of Arcola. How it would come about he did not<br>know, but he felt sure it would do so. The locality and the position of<br>our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone<br>in our army. His own strategic plan, which obviously could not now<br>be carried out, was forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother’s plan,<br>Prince Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects<br>such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision.<br><br>To the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen forces<br>could be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would<br>concentrate. “There we shall encounter difficulties, and there,”<br>thought he, “I shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there,<br>standard in hand, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of<br>me.”<br><br>He could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions.<br>Seeing them he kept thinking, “That may be the very standard with<br>which I shall lead the army.”<br><br>In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was<br>a hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a<br>milk-white sea. Nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which<br>our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing.<br>Above the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right the vast orb<br>of the sun. In front, far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist,<br>some wooded hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably<br>was, for something could be descried. On the right the Guards were<br>entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and<br>then a gleam of bayonets; to the left beyond the village similar masses<br>of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist. In front and<br>behind moved infantry. The commander in chief was standing at the end of<br>the village letting the troops pass by him. That morning Kutúzov seemed<br>worn and irritable. The infantry passing before him came to a halt<br>without any command being given, apparently obstructed by something in<br>front.<br><br>“Do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the<br>village!” he said angrily to a general who had ridden up. “Don’t<br>you understand, your excellency, my dear sir, that you must not<br>defile through narrow village streets when we are marching against the<br>enemy?”<br><br>“I intended to re-form them beyond the village, your excellency,”<br>answered the general.<br><br>Kutúzov laughed bitterly.<br><br>“You’ll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy!<br>Very fine!”<br><br>“The enemy is still far away, your excellency. According to the<br>dispositions...”<br><br>“The dispositions!” exclaimed Kutúzov bitterly. “Who told you<br>that?... Kindly do as you are ordered.”<br><br>“Yes, sir.”<br><br>“My dear fellow,” Nesvítski whispered to Prince Andrew, “the old<br>man is as surly as a dog.”<br><br>An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat<br>galloped up to Kutúzov and asked in the Emperor’s name had the fourth<br>column advanced into action.<br><br>Kutúzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall<br>upon Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, Kutúzov’s<br>malevolent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what<br>was being done was not his adjutant’s fault, and still not answering<br>the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkónski.<br><br>“Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed the<br>village. Tell it to stop and await my orders.”<br><br>Hardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.<br><br>“And ask whether sharpshooters have been posted,” he added. “What<br>are they doing? What are they doing?” he murmured to himself, still<br>not replying to the Austrian.<br><br>Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.<br><br>Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped<br>the third division and convinced himself that there really were no<br>sharpshooters in front of our columns. The colonel at the head of the<br>regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief’s order to throw<br>out skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops<br>in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away.<br>There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent<br>hidden by dense mist. Having given orders in the commander in chief’s<br>name to rectify this omission, Prince Andrew galloped back. Kutúzov<br>still in the same place, his stout body resting heavily in the saddle<br>with the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily with closed eyes. The<br>troops were no longer moving, but stood with the butts of their muskets<br>on the ground.<br><br>“All right, all right!” he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a<br>general who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all<br>the left-flank columns had already descended.<br><br>“Plenty of time, your excellency,” muttered Kutúzov in the midst of<br>a yawn. “Plenty of time,” he repeated.<br><br>Just then at a distance behind Kutúzov was heard the sound of regiments<br>saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended<br>line of the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person they were<br>greeting was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment in front<br>of which Kutúzov was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one<br>side and looked round with a frown. Along the road from Pratzen galloped<br>what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them<br>rode side by side in front, at full gallop. One in a black uniform with<br>white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who<br>was in a white uniform rode a black one. These were the two Emperors<br>followed by their suites. Kutúzov, affecting the manners of an old<br>soldier at the front, gave the command “Attention!” and rode up<br>to the Emperors with a salute. His whole appearance and manner were<br>suddenly transformed. He put on the air of a subordinate who obeys<br>without reasoning. With an affectation of respect which evidently struck<br>Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted.<br><br>This unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face<br>of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished.<br>After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field<br>of Olmütz where Bolkónski had seen him for the first time abroad, but<br>there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness<br>in his fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for<br>varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted<br>innocent youth.<br><br>At the Olmütz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed<br>brighter and more energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping two<br>miles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round<br>at the faces of his suite, young and animated as his own. Czartorýski,<br>Novosíltsev, Prince Volkónsky, Strógonov, and the others, all richly<br>dressed gay young men on splendid, well-groomed, fresh, only slightly<br>heated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the<br>Emperor. The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very<br>erect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and<br>preoccupied manner. He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked<br>some question—“Most likely he is asking at what o’clock they<br>started,” thought Prince Andrew, watching his old acquaintance with<br>a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at Brünn.<br>In the Emperors’ suite were the picked young orderly officers of the<br>Guard and line regiments, Russian and Austrian. Among them were grooms<br>leading the Tsar’s beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered<br>cloths.<br><br>As when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters<br>a stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and confidence of<br>success reached Kutúzov’s cheerless staff with the galloping advent<br>of all these brilliant young men.<br><br>“Why aren’t you beginning, Michael Ilariónovich?” said the<br>Emperor Alexander hurriedly to Kutúzov, glancing courteously at the<br>same time at the Emperor Francis.<br><br>“I am waiting, Your Majesty,” answered Kutúzov, bending forward<br>respectfully.<br><br>The Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had not<br>quite heard.<br><br>“Waiting, Your Majesty,” repeated Kutúzov. (Prince Andrew noted<br>that Kutúzov’s upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the<br>word “waiting.”) “Not all the columns have formed up yet, Your<br>Majesty.”<br><br>The Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his<br>rather round shoulders and glanced at Novosíltsev who was near him, as<br>if complaining of Kutúzov.<br><br>“You know, Michael Ilariónovich, we are not on the Empress’ Field<br>where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled,” said<br>the Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting<br>him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying. But the<br>Emperor Francis continued to look about him and did not listen.<br><br>“That is just why I do not begin, sire,” said Kutúzov in a<br>resounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being<br>heard, and again something in his face twitched—“That is just why<br>I do not begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on the<br>Empress’ Field,” said he clearly and distinctly.<br><br>In the Emperor’s suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed<br>dissatisfaction and reproach. “Old though he may be, he should not, he<br>certainly should not, speak like that,” their glances seemed to say.<br><br>The Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kutúzov’s eye<br>waiting to hear whether he would say anything more. But Kutúzov, with<br>respectfully bowed head, seemed also to be waiting. The silence lasted<br>for about a minute.<br><br>“However, if you command it, Your Majesty,” said Kutúzov, lifting<br>his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning, but<br>submissive general.<br><br>He touched his horse and having called Milorádovich, the commander of<br>the column, gave him the order to advance.<br><br>The troops again began to move, and two battalions of the Nóvgorod and<br>one of the Ápsheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.<br><br>As this Ápsheron battalion marched by, the red-faced Milorádovich,<br>without his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous<br>tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front<br>and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined<br>in his horse before the Emperor.<br><br>“God be with you, general!” said the Emperor.<br><br>“Ma foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilité,<br>sire,” * he answered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among<br>the gentlemen of the Tsar’s suite by his poor French.<br><br>     * “Indeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possible to<br>     do, Sire.”<br><br><br>Milorádovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little<br>behind the Emperor. The Ápsheron men, excited by the Tsar’s presence,<br>passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk<br>pace.<br><br>“Lads!” shouted Milorádovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery<br>voice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect of<br>battle, and by the sight of the gallant Ápsherons, his comrades in<br>Suvórov’s time, now passing so gallantly before the Emperors, that he<br>forgot the sovereigns’ presence. “Lads, it’s not the first village<br>you’ve had to take,” cried he.<br><br>“Glad to do our best!” shouted the soldiers.<br><br>The Emperor’s horse started at the sudden cry. This horse that had<br>carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the<br>field of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and<br>pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the<br>Empress’ Field, not understanding the significance of the firing, nor<br>of the nearness of the Emperor Francis’ black cob, nor of all that was<br>being said, thought, and felt that day by its rider.<br><br>The Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a<br>remark to him, pointing to the gallant Ápsherons.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>Kutúzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the<br>carabineers.<br><br>When he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he<br>stopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably once been an<br>inn, where two roads parted. Both of them led downhill and troops were<br>marching along both.<br><br>The fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible<br>about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. Down below, on<br>the left, the firing became more distinct. Kutúzov had stopped and was<br>speaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who was a little behind<br>looking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass.<br><br>“Look, look!” said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the<br>distance, but down the hill before him. “It’s the French!”<br><br>The two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, trying<br>to snatch it from one another. The expression on all their faces<br>suddenly changed to one of horror. The French were supposed to be a<br>mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in<br>front of us.<br><br>“It’s the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But<br>how is that?” said different voices.<br><br>With the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not more<br>than five hundred paces from where Kutúzov was standing, a dense French<br>column coming up to meet the Ápsherons.<br><br>“Here it is! The decisive moment has arrived. My turn has come,”<br>thought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kutúzov.<br><br>“The Ápsherons must be stopped, your excellency,” cried he. But at<br>that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was heard<br>quite close at hand, and a voice of naïve terror barely two steps from<br>Prince Andrew shouted, “Brothers! All’s lost!” And at this as if<br>at a command, everyone began to run.<br><br>Confused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five<br>minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only would it<br>have been difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible not to<br>be carried back with it oneself. Bolkónski only tried not to lose<br>touch with it, and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was<br>happening in front of him. Nesvítski with an angry face, red and unlike<br>himself, was shouting to Kutúzov that if he did not ride away at once<br>he would certainly be taken prisoner. Kutúzov remained in the same<br>place and without answering drew out a handkerchief. Blood was flowing<br>from his cheek. Prince Andrew forced his way to him.<br><br>“You are wounded?” he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of<br>his lower jaw.<br><br>“The wound is not here, it is there!” said Kutúzov, pressing the<br>handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers.<br>“Stop them!” he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing<br>that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the<br>right.<br><br>A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.<br><br>The troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by<br>them it was difficult to get out again. One was shouting, “Get on!<br>Why are you hindering us?” Another in the same place turned round and<br>fired in the air; a third was striking the horse Kutúzov himself rode.<br>Having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men,<br>Kutúzov, with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward a<br>sound of artillery fire near by. Having forced his way out of the crowd<br>of fugitives, Prince Andrew, trying to keep near Kutúzov, saw on the<br>slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing<br>and Frenchmen running toward it. Higher up stood some Russian infantry,<br>neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the<br>fleeing crowd. A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and<br>approached Kutúzov. Of Kutúzov’s suite only four remained. They were<br>all pale and exchanged looks in silence.<br><br>“Stop those wretches!” gasped Kutúzov to the regimental commander,<br>pointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to punish<br>him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across<br>Kutúzov’s suite like a flock of little birds.<br><br>The French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutúzov, were firing<br>at him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg;<br>several soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding the<br>flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the<br>muskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing without<br>orders.<br><br>“Oh! Oh! Oh!” groaned Kutúzov despairingly and looked around....<br>“Bolkónski!” he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness<br>of the feebleness of age, “Bolkónski!” he whispered, pointing to<br>the disordered battalion and at the enemy, “what’s that?”<br><br>But before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of<br>shame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to<br>the standard.<br><br>“Forward, lads!” he shouted in a voice piercing as a child’s.<br><br>“Here it is!” thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and<br>hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him.<br>Several soldiers fell.<br><br>“Hurrah!” shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up<br>the heavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole<br>battalion would follow him.<br><br>And really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then<br>another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting “Hurrah!”<br>and overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag<br>that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew’s hands, but he<br>was immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and,<br>dragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he saw our<br>artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having abandoned<br>their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French infantry<br>soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns<br>round. Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces<br>of the cannon. He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and<br>to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped. But<br>he did not look at them: he looked only at what was going on in front<br>of him—at the battery. He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired<br>gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while<br>a French soldier tugged at the other. He could distinctly see the<br>distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men, who<br>evidently did not realize what they were doing.<br><br>“What are they about?” thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them.<br>“Why doesn’t the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed?<br>Why doesn’t the Frenchman stab him? He will not get away before the<br>Frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him....”<br><br>And really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to<br>the struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had<br>triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him,<br>was about to be decided. But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended. It<br>seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head<br>with the full swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but the worst of<br>it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had<br>been looking at.<br><br>“What’s this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way,” thought he,<br>and fell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle<br>of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner<br>had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or<br>saved. But he saw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the<br>sky—the lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray<br>clouds gliding slowly across it. “How quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not<br>at all as I ran,” thought Prince Andrew—“not as we ran, shouting<br>and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened<br>and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds<br>glide across that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did not see that<br>lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All<br>is vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite sky. There is nothing,<br>nothing, but that. But even it does not exist, there is nothing but<br>quiet and peace. Thank God!...”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVII<br><br>On our right flank commanded by Bagratión, at nine o’clock the battle<br>had not yet begun. Not wishing to agree to Dolgorúkov’s demand to<br>commence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself,<br>Prince Bagratión proposed to Dolgorúkov to send to inquire of the<br>commander in chief. Bagratión knew that as the distance between the two<br>flanks was more than six miles, even if the messenger were not killed<br>(which he very likely would be), and found the commander in chief<br>(which would be very difficult), he would not be able to get back before<br>evening.<br><br>Bagratión cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite,<br>and the boyish face Rostóv, breathless with excitement and hope, was<br>the first to catch his eye. He sent him.<br><br>“And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in<br>chief, your excellency?” said Rostóv, with his hand to his cap.<br><br>“You can give the message to His Majesty,” said Dolgorúkov,<br>hurriedly interrupting Bagratión.<br><br>On being relieved from picket duty Rostóv had managed to get a few<br>hours’ sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute,<br>with elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and generally in<br>that state of mind which makes everything seem possible, pleasant, and<br>easy.<br><br>All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was to be a<br>general engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he was<br>orderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going with a<br>message to Kutúzov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself. The morning<br>was bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of<br>joy and happiness. On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein<br>and galloped along the line. At first he rode along the line of<br>Bagratión’s troops, which had not yet advanced into action but were<br>standing motionless; then he came to the region occupied by Uvárov’s<br>cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle;<br>having passed Uvárov’s cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon<br>and musketry ahead of him. The firing grew louder and louder.<br><br>In the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket shots<br>at irregular intervals as before, followed by one or two cannon shots,<br>but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before<br>Pratzen, interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes<br>several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a<br>general roar.<br><br>He could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another<br>down the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, spreading,<br>and mingling with one another. He could also, by the gleam of bayonets<br>visible through the smoke, make out moving masses of infantry and narrow<br>lines of artillery with green caissons.<br><br>Rostóv stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was<br>going on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand<br>or make out anything of what was happening: there in the smoke men of<br>some sort were moving about, in front and behind moved lines of troops;<br>but why, whither, and who they were, it was impossible to make out.<br>These sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him;<br>on the contrary, they stimulated his energy and determination.<br><br>“Go on! Go on! Give it them!” he mentally exclaimed at these sounds,<br>and again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and<br>farther into the region where the army was already in action.<br><br>“How it will be there I don’t know, but all will be well!” thought<br>Rostóv.<br><br>After passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the<br>line (the Guards) was already in action.<br><br>“So much the better! I shall see it close,” he thought.<br><br>He was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men came<br>galloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered<br>ranks were returning from the attack. Rostóv got out of their way,<br>involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.<br><br>“That is no business of mine,” he thought. He had not ridden many<br>hundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole<br>width of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white<br>uniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight toward him and<br>across his path. Rostóv put his horse to full gallop to get out of the<br>way of these men, and he would have got clear had they continued at the<br>same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the<br>horses were already galloping. Rostóv heard the thud of their hoofs<br>and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their figures, and<br>even their faces, more and more distinctly. They were our Horse Guards,<br>advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them.<br><br>The Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses.<br>Rostóv could already see their faces and heard the command:<br>“Charge!” shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to<br>full speed. Rostóv, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on<br>the French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but<br>still was not in time to avoid them.<br><br>The last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily<br>on seeing Rostóv before him, with whom he would inevitably collide.<br>This Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rostóv and his Bedouin over<br>(Rostóv felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men<br>and horses) had it not occurred to Rostóv to flourish his whip before<br>the eyes of the Guardsman’s horse. The heavy black horse, sixteen<br>hands high, shied, throwing back its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman<br>drove his huge spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail<br>and extending its neck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse<br>Guards passed Rostóv before he heard them shout, “Hurrah!” and<br>looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some<br>foreign cavalry with red epaulets, probably French. He could see nothing<br>more, for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and<br>smoke enveloped everything.<br><br>At that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him, disappeared in<br>the smoke, Rostóv hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where<br>he was sent. This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that<br>amazed the French themselves. Rostóv was horrified to hear later that<br>of all that mass of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant,<br>rich youths, officers and cadets, who had galloped past him on their<br>thousand-ruble horses, only eighteen were left after the charge.<br><br>“Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see<br>the Emperor immediately!” thought Rostóv and galloped on.<br><br>When he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and<br>around them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so<br>much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on<br>the soldiers’ faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the<br>officers.<br><br>Passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a<br>voice calling him by name.<br><br>“Rostóv!”<br><br>“What?” he answered, not recognizing Borís.<br><br>“I say, we’ve been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!” said<br>Borís with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been<br>under fire for the first time.<br><br>Rostóv stopped.<br><br>“Have you?” he said. “Well, how did it go?”<br><br>“We drove them back!” said Borís with animation, growing talkative.<br>“Can you imagine it?” and he began describing how the Guards, having<br>taken up their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were<br>Austrians, and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged<br>by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had<br>unexpectedly to go into action. Rostóv without hearing Borís to the<br>end spurred his horse.<br><br>“Where are you off to?” asked Borís.<br><br>“With a message to His Majesty.”<br><br>“There he is!” said Borís, thinking Rostóv had said “His<br>Highness,” and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders<br>and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet<br>and Horse Guards’ jacket, shouting something to a pale, white<br>uniformed Austrian officer.<br><br>“But that’s the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the<br>Emperor,” said Rostóv, and was about to spur his horse.<br><br>“Count! Count!” shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager<br>as Borís. “Count! I am wounded in my right hand” (and he showed his<br>bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) “and I remained at<br>the front. I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our family—the<br>von Bergs—have been knights!”<br><br>He said something more, but Rostóv did not wait to hear it and rode<br>away.<br><br>Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rostóv, to avoid<br>again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse<br>Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place<br>where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard. Suddenly he<br>heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops,<br>where he could never have expected the enemy to be.<br><br>“What can it be?” he thought. “The enemy in the rear of our army?<br>Impossible!” And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself<br>and for the issue of the whole battle. “But be that what it may,”<br>he reflected, “there is no riding round it now. I must look for the<br>commander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with<br>the rest.”<br><br>The foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rostóv was more and<br>more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of<br>Pratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds.<br><br>“What does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is<br>firing?” Rostóv kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian<br>soldiers running in confused crowds across his path.<br><br>“The devil knows! They’ve killed everybody! It’s all up now!”<br>he was told in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who<br>understood what was happening as little as he did.<br><br>“Kill the Germans!” shouted one.<br><br>“May the devil take them—the traitors!”<br><br>“Zum Henker diese Russen!” * muttered a German.<br><br>    * “Hang these Russians!”<br><br><br>Several wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse, screams,<br>and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing died down.<br>Rostóv learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing<br>at one another.<br><br>“My God! What does it all mean?” thought he. “And here, where at<br>any moment the Emperor may see them.... But no, these must be only a<br>handful of scoundrels. It will soon be over, it can’t be that, it<br>can’t be! Only to get past them quicker, quicker!”<br><br>The idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rostóv’s head. Though<br>he saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where<br>he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he could not,<br>did not wish to, believe that.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>Rostóv had been ordered to look for Kutúzov and the Emperor near the<br>village of Pratzen. But neither they nor a single commanding officer<br>were there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds. He<br>urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but<br>the farther he went the more disorganized they were. The highroad on<br>which he had come out was thronged with calèches, carriages of all<br>sorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and<br>some not. This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the<br>dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries<br>stationed on the Pratzen Heights.<br><br>“Where is the Emperor? Where is Kutúzov?” Rostóv kept asking<br>everyone he could stop, but got no answer from anyone.<br><br>At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.<br><br>“Eh, brother! They’ve all bolted long ago!” said the soldier,<br>laughing for some reason and shaking himself free.<br><br>Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rostóv stopped the<br>horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to<br>question him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a<br>carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and<br>that he was dangerously wounded.<br><br>“It can’t be!” said Rostóv. “It must have been someone else.”<br><br>“I saw him myself,” replied the man with a self-confident smile of<br>derision. “I ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times I’ve<br>seen him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see you.... There he sat in<br>the carriage as pale as anything. How they made the four black horses<br>fly! Gracious me, they did rattle past! It’s time I knew the Imperial<br>horses and Ilyá Iványch. I don’t think Ilyá drives anyone except<br>the Tsar!”<br><br>Rostóv let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded<br>officer passing by addressed him:<br><br>“Who is it you want?” he asked. “The commander in chief? He was<br>killed by a cannon ball—struck in the breast before our regiment.”<br><br>“Not killed—wounded!” another officer corrected him.<br><br>“Who? Kutúzov?” asked Rostóv.<br><br>“Not Kutúzov, but what’s his name—well, never mind... there are<br>not many left alive. Go that way, to that village, all the commanders<br>are there,” said the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek,<br>and he walked on.<br><br>Rostóv rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now<br>going. The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible to<br>doubt it now. Rostóv rode in the direction pointed out to him, in which<br>he saw turrets and a church. What need to hurry? What was he now to say<br>to the Tsar or to Kutúzov, even if they were alive and unwounded?<br><br>“Take this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!” a<br>soldier shouted to him. “They’d kill you there!”<br><br>“Oh, what are you talking about?” said another. “Where is he to<br>go? That way is nearer.”<br><br>Rostóv considered, and then went in the direction where they said he<br>would be killed.<br><br>“It’s all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to<br>save myself?” he thought. He rode on to the region where the greatest<br>number of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen. The French had not<br>yet occupied that region, and the Russians—the uninjured and slightly<br>wounded—had left it long ago. All about the field, like heaps of<br>manure on well-kept plowland, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded<br>to each couple of acres. The wounded crept together in twos and threes<br>and one could hear their distressing screams and groans, sometimes<br>feigned—or so it seemed to Rostóv. He put his horse to a trot to<br>avoid seeing all these suffering men, and he felt afraid—afraid not<br>for his life, but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not<br>stand the sight of these unfortunates.<br><br>The French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and<br>wounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an adjutant<br>riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots. The<br>sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around<br>him merged in Rostóv’s mind into a single feeling of terror and pity<br>for himself. He remembered his mother’s last letter. “What would she<br>feel,” thought he, “if she saw me here now on this field with the<br>cannon aimed at me?”<br><br>In the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from<br>the field of battle, who though still in some confusion were less<br>disordered. The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire<br>sounded far away. Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle<br>was lost. No one whom Rostóv asked could tell him where the Emperor<br>or Kutúzov was. Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was<br>correct, others that it was not, and explained the false rumor that had<br>spread by the fact that the Emperor’s carriage had really galloped<br>from the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal<br>Count Tolstóy, who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in<br>the Emperor’s suite. One officer told Rostóv that he had seen someone<br>from headquarters behind the village to the left, and thither Rostóv<br>rode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience. When<br>he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian<br>troops, he saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men<br>on horseback facing the ditch. One with a white plume in his hat seemed<br>familiar to Rostóv; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which<br>Rostóv fancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his<br>horse with his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only<br>a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse’s hind hoofs.<br>Turning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially<br>addressed the horseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting<br>that he should do the same. The rider, whose figure seemed familiar<br>to Rostóv and involuntarily riveted his attention, made a gesture of<br>refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture Rostóv instantly<br>recognized his lamented and adored monarch.<br><br>“But it can’t be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!”<br>thought Rostóv. At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rostóv<br>saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory. The<br>Emperor was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the charm,<br>the mildness of his features, was all the greater. Rostóv was happy<br>in the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were<br>false. He was happy to be seeing him. He knew that he might and even<br>ought to go straight to him and give the message Dolgorúkov had ordered<br>him to deliver.<br><br>But as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter the<br>thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help or a<br>chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is<br>alone with her, so Rostóv, now that he had attained what he had longed<br>for more than anything else in the world, did not know how to approach<br>the Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be<br>inconvenient, unseemly, and impossible to do so.<br><br>“What! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of<br>his being alone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant or<br>painful to him at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to him<br>now, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight<br>of him?” Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor<br>that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall. Those<br>speeches were intended for quite other conditions, they were for the<br>most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph, generally<br>when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic<br>deeds, and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved.<br><br>“Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right<br>flank now that it is nearly four o’clock and the battle is lost?<br>No, certainly I must not approach him, I must not intrude on his<br>reflections. Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind<br>look or bad opinion from him,” Rostóv decided; and sorrowfully and<br>with a heart full despair he rode away, continually looking back at the<br>Tsar, who still remained in the same attitude of indecision.<br><br>While Rostóv was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away,<br>Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the<br>Emperor at once rode up to him, offered his services, and assisted him<br>to cross the ditch on foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling<br>unwell, sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him.<br>Rostóv from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke<br>long and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor, evidently weeping,<br>covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Toll’s hand.<br><br>“And I might have been in his place!” thought Rostóv, and hardly<br>restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter<br>despair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.<br><br>His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was<br>the cause of his grief.<br><br>He might... not only might but should, have gone up to the sovereign. It<br>was a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had not<br>made use of it.... “What have I done?” thought he. And he turned<br>round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor, but<br>there was no one beyond the ditch now. Only some carts and carriages<br>were passing by. From one of the drivers he learned that Kutúzov’s<br>staff were not far off, in the village the vehicles were going to.<br>Rostóv followed them. In front of him walked Kutúzov’s groom leading<br>horses in horsecloths. Then came a cart, and behind that walked an old,<br>bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat.<br><br>“Tit! I say, Tit!” said the groom.<br><br>“What?” answered the old man absent-mindedly.<br><br>“Go, Tit! Thresh a bit!”<br><br>“Oh, you fool!” said the old man, spitting angrily. Some time passed<br>in silence, and then the same joke was repeated.<br><br><br>Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points. More<br>than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French.<br><br>Przebyszéwski and his corps had laid down their arms. Other columns<br>after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused<br>masses.<br><br>The remains of Langeron’s and Dokhtúrov’s mingled forces were<br>crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of<br>Augesd.<br><br>After five o’clock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade<br>(delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard from numerous<br>batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights, directed at our<br>retreating forces.<br><br>In the rearguard, Dokhtúrov and others rallying some battalions kept up<br>a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops. It<br>was growing dusk. On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the<br>old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully<br>angling, while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the<br>floundering silvery fish in the watering can, on that dam over which for<br>so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully<br>driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty<br>with flour whitening their carts—on that narrow dam amid the wagons<br>and the cannon, under the horses’ hoofs and between the wagon wheels,<br>men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one<br>another, dying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to<br>move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way.<br><br>Every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around, or<br>a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and<br>splashing with blood those near them.<br><br>Dólokhov—now an officer—wounded in the arm, and on foot, with<br>the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company,<br>represented all that was left of that whole regiment. Impelled by the<br>crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and, jammed in<br>on all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a<br>cannon and the crowd were dragging it out. A cannon ball killed someone<br>behind them, another fell in front and splashed Dólokhov with blood.<br>The crowd, pushing forward desperately, squeezed together, moved a few<br>steps, and again stopped.<br><br>“Move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved, remain here<br>another two minutes and it is certain death,” thought each one.<br><br>Dólokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge<br>of the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto the<br>slippery ice that covered the millpool.<br><br>“Turn this way!” he shouted, jumping over the ice which creaked<br>under him; “turn this way!” he shouted to those with the gun. “It<br>bears!...”<br><br>The ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain that it<br>would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but very soon even<br>under his weight alone. The men looked at him and pressed to the<br>bank, hesitating to step onto the ice. The general on horseback at the<br>entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address<br>Dólokhov. Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that<br>everyone ducked. It flopped into something moist, and the general fell<br>from his horse in a pool of blood. Nobody gave him a look or thought of<br>raising him.<br><br>“Get onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Don’t you hear? Go<br>on!” innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck<br>the general, the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were<br>shouting.<br><br>One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the<br>ice. Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond.<br>The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped<br>into the water. He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist.<br>The nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped his horse, but<br>from behind still came the shouts: “Onto the ice, why do you stop? Go<br>on! Go on!” And cries of horror were heard in the crowd. The soldiers<br>near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and<br>move on. The horses moved off the bank. The ice, that had held under<br>those on foot, collapsed in a great mass, and some forty men who were on<br>it dashed, some forward and some back, drowning one another.<br><br>Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the<br>ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered<br>the dam, the pond, and the bank.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIX<br><br>On the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his<br>hand, lay Prince Andrew Bolkónski bleeding profusely and unconsciously<br>uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.<br><br>Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still. He did not know<br>how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt that he was<br>alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.<br><br>“Where is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw<br>today?” was his first thought. “And I did not know this suffering<br>either,” he thought. “Yes, I did not know anything, anything at all<br>till now. But where am I?”<br><br>He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices<br>speaking French. He opened his eyes. Above him again was the same lofty<br>sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and<br>between them gleamed blue infinity. He did not turn his head and did not<br>see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up<br>and stopped near him.<br><br>It was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp. Bonaparte riding<br>over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries<br>firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left<br>on the field.<br><br>“Fine men!” remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier,<br>who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his<br>stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.<br><br>“The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your<br>Majesty,” said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were<br>firing at Augesd.<br><br>“Have some brought from the reserve,” said Napoleon, and having gone<br>on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back with<br>the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. (The flag had already<br>been taken by the French as a trophy.)<br><br>“That’s a fine death!” said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolkónski.<br><br>Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was<br>Napoleon who said it. He heard the speaker addressed as Sire. But he<br>heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Not only<br>did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once<br>forgot them. His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death,<br>and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He knew it<br>was Napoleon—his hero—but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him<br>such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now<br>between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over<br>it. At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over<br>him, or what was said of him; he was only glad that people were standing<br>near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to<br>life, which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to<br>understand it so differently. He collected all his strength, to stir and<br>utter a sound. He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan<br>which aroused his own pity.<br><br>“Ah! He is alive,” said Napoleon. “Lift this young man up and<br>carry him to the dressing station.”<br><br>Having said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in<br>hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory.<br><br>Prince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the<br>terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while<br>being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station.<br>He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other<br>wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital.<br>During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look<br>about him and even speak.<br><br>The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French<br>convoy officer, who said rapidly: “We must halt here: the Emperor<br>will pass here immediately; it will please him to see these gentlemen<br>prisoners.”<br><br>“There are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army,<br>that he is probably tired of them,” said another officer.<br><br>“All the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor<br>Alexander’s Guards,” said the first one, indicating a Russian<br>officer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards.<br><br>Bolkónski recognized Prince Repnín whom he had met in Petersburg<br>society. Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of<br>the Horse Guards.<br><br>Bonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.<br><br>“Which is the senior?” he asked, on seeing the prisoners.<br><br>They named the colonel, Prince Repnín.<br><br>“You are the commander of the Emperor Alexander’s regiment of Horse<br>Guards?” asked Napoleon.<br><br>“I commanded a squadron,” replied Repnín.<br><br>“Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably,” said Napoleon.<br><br>“The praise of a great commander is a soldier’s highest reward,”<br>said Repnín.<br><br>“I bestow it with pleasure,” said Napoleon. “And who is that young<br>man beside you?”<br><br>Prince Repnín named Lieutenant Sukhtélen.<br><br>After looking at him Napoleon smiled.<br><br>“He’s very young to come to meddle with us.”<br><br>“Youth is no hindrance to courage,” muttered Sukhtélen in a failing<br>voice.<br><br>“A splendid reply!” said Napoleon. “Young man, you will go far!”<br><br>Prince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Emperor’s<br>eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his<br>attention. Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield<br>and, addressing him, again used the epithet “young man” that was<br>connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.<br><br>“Well, and you, young man,” said he. “How do you feel, mon<br>brave?”<br><br>Though five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few<br>words to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed<br>straight on Napoleon, he was silent.... So insignificant at that moment<br>seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his<br>hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear,<br>compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and<br>understood, that he could not answer him.<br><br>Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the<br>stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood,<br>suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him. Looking into<br>Napoleon’s eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of<br>greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and<br>the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one<br>alive could understand or explain.<br><br>The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of<br>the officers as he went: “Have these gentlemen attended to and taken<br>to my bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds. Au revoir,<br>Prince Repnín!” and he spurred his horse and galloped away.<br><br>His face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.<br><br>The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the<br>little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother’s neck, but<br>seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to<br>return the holy image.<br><br>Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the<br>little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest<br>outside his uniform.<br><br>“It would be good,” thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his<br>sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, “it<br>would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to<br>Mary. How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life,<br>and what to expect after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I<br>should be if I could now say: ‘Lord, have mercy on me!’... But to<br>whom should I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible,<br>which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in<br>words—the Great All or Nothing-” said he to himself, “or to<br>that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing<br>certain, nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I<br>understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but<br>all-important.”<br><br>The stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain;<br>his feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions of his father,<br>wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night<br>before the battle, the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon, and<br>above all this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious<br>fancies.<br><br>The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented<br>itself to him. He was already enjoying that happiness when that<br>little Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of<br>shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and torments<br>had followed, and only the heavens promised peace. Toward morning<br>all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of<br>unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleon’s doctor,<br>Larrey, was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence.<br><br>“He is a nervous, bilious subject,” said Larrey, “and will not<br>recover.”<br><br>And Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care of<br>the inhabitants of the district.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK FOUR: 1806<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>Early in the year 1806 Nicholas Rostóv returned home on leave. Denísov<br>was going home to Vorónezh and Rostóv persuaded him to travel with him<br>as far as Moscow and to stay with him there. Meeting a comrade at<br>the last post station but one before Moscow, Denísov had drunk three<br>bottles of wine with him and, despite the jolting ruts across the<br>snow-covered road, did not once wake up on the way to Moscow, but lay<br>at the bottom of the sleigh beside Rostóv, who grew more and more<br>impatient the nearer they got to Moscow.<br><br>“How much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets,<br>shops, bakers’ signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!” thought<br>Rostóv, when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and<br>they had entered Moscow.<br><br>“Denísov! We’re here! He’s asleep,” he added, leaning forward<br>with his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed<br>of the sleigh.<br><br>Denísov gave no answer.<br><br>“There’s the corner at the crossroads, where the cabman, Zakhár,<br>has his stand, and there’s Zakhár himself and still the same horse!<br>And here’s the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread! Can’t<br>you hurry up? Now then!”<br><br>“Which house is it?” asked the driver.<br><br>“Why, that one, right at the end, the big one. Don’t you see?<br>That’s our house,” said Rostóv. “Of course, it’s our house!<br>Denísov, Denísov! We’re almost there!”<br><br>Denísov raised his head, coughed, and made no answer.<br><br>“Dmítri,” said Rostóv to his valet on the box, “those lights are<br>in our house, aren’t they?”<br><br>“Yes, sir, and there’s a light in your father’s study.”<br><br>“Then they’ve not gone to bed yet? What do you think? Mind now,<br>don’t forget to put out my new coat,” added Rostóv, fingering his<br>new mustache. “Now then, get on,” he shouted to the driver. “Do<br>wake up, Váska!” he went on, turning to Denísov, whose head<br>was again nodding. “Come, get on! You shall have three rubles for<br>vodka—get on!” Rostóv shouted, when the sleigh was only three<br>houses from his door. It seemed to him the horses were not moving at<br>all. At last the sleigh bore to the right, drew up at an entrance, and<br>Rostóv saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster<br>broken off, the porch, and the post by the side of the pavement. He<br>sprang out before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The house<br>stood cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it.<br>There was no one in the hall. “Oh God! Is everyone all right?”<br>he thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and then<br>immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of<br>the familiar staircase. The well-known old door handle, which always<br>angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned, turned as loosely<br>as ever. A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom.<br><br>Old Michael was asleep on the chest. Prokófy, the footman, who was<br>so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind, sat<br>plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges. He looked up at the opening<br>door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one<br>of delighted amazement.<br><br>“Gracious heavens! The young count!” he cried, recognizing his<br>young master. “Can it be? My treasure!” and Prokófy, trembling with<br>excitement, rushed toward the drawing room door, probably in order to<br>announce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss the<br>young man’s shoulder.<br><br>“All well?” asked Rostóv, drawing away his arm.<br><br>“Yes, God be thanked! Yes! They’ve just finished supper. Let me have<br>a look at you, your excellency.”<br><br>“Is everything quite all right?”<br><br>“The Lord be thanked, yes!”<br><br>Rostóv, who had completely forgotten Denísov, not wishing anyone to<br>forestall him, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the<br>large dark ballroom. All was the same: there were the same old card<br>tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it; but someone had<br>already seen the young master, and, before he had reached the drawing<br>room, something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began<br>hugging and kissing him. Another and yet another creature of the same<br>kind sprang from a second door and a third; more hugging, more kissing,<br>more outcries, and tears of joy. He could not distinguish which was<br>Papa, which Natásha, and which Pétya. Everyone shouted, talked, and<br>kissed him at the same time. Only his mother was not there, he noticed<br>that.<br><br>“And I did not know... Nicholas... My darling!...”<br><br>“Here he is... our own... Kólya, * dear fellow... How he has<br>changed!... Where are the candles?... Tea!...”<br><br>    * Nicholas.<br><br>“And me, kiss me!”<br><br>“Dearest... and me!”<br><br>Sónya, Natásha, Pétya, Anna Mikháylovna, Véra, and the old count<br>were all hugging him, and the serfs, men and maids, flocked into the<br>room, exclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing.<br><br>Pétya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, “And me too!”<br><br>Natásha, after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face<br>with kisses, holding him tight by the skirt of his coat, sprang away and<br>pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly.<br><br>All around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy, and all around<br>were lips seeking a kiss.<br><br>Sónya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss,<br>looked eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the look for which she<br>longed. Sónya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, especially at<br>this moment of happy, rapturous excitement. She gazed at him, not taking<br>her eyes off him, and smiling and holding her breath. He gave her a<br>grateful look, but was still expectant and looking for someone. The old<br>countess had not yet come. But now steps were heard at the door, steps<br>so rapid that they could hardly be his mother’s.<br><br>Yet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not know, made since<br>he had left. All the others let him go, and he ran to her. When they<br>met, she fell on his breast, sobbing. She could not lift her face, but<br>only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussar’s jacket. Denísov,<br>who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there and wiped<br>his eyes at the sight.<br><br>“Vasíli Denísov, your son’s friend,” he said, introducing<br>himself to the count, who was looking inquiringly at him.<br><br>“You are most welcome! I know, I know,” said the count, kissing and<br>embracing Denísov. “Nicholas wrote us... Natásha, Véra, look! Here<br>is Denísov!”<br><br>The same happy, rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of Denísov.<br><br>“Darling Denísov!” screamed Natásha, beside herself with rapture,<br>springing to him, putting her arms round him, and kissing him. This<br>escapade made everybody feel confused. Denísov blushed too, but smiled<br>and, taking Natásha’s hand, kissed it.<br><br>Denísov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the Rostóvs all<br>gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room.<br><br>The old countess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it every<br>moment, sat beside him: the rest, crowding round him, watched every<br>movement, word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully adoring<br>eyes off him. His brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest<br>to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea,<br>handkerchief, and pipe.<br><br>Rostóv was very happy in the love they showed him; but the first<br>moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed<br>insufficient, and he kept expecting something more, more and yet more.<br><br>Next morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers slept<br>till ten o’clock.<br><br>In the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers,<br>satchels, sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two freshly<br>cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall. The servants<br>were bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and their<br>well-brushed clothes. There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco.<br><br>“Hallo, Gwíska—my pipe!” came Vasíli Denísov’s husky voice.<br>“Wostóv, get up!”<br><br>Rostóv, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised his<br>disheveled head from the hot pillow.<br><br>“Why, is it late?”<br><br>“Late! It’s nearly ten o’clock,” answered Natásha’s voice.<br>A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of<br>girls’ voices came from the adjoining room. The door was opened a<br>crack and there was a glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black hair,<br>and merry faces. It was Natásha, Sónya, and Pétya, who had come to<br>see whether they were getting up.<br><br>“Nicholas! Get up!” Natásha’s voice was again heard at the door.<br><br>“Directly!”<br><br>Meanwhile, Pétya, having found and seized the sabers in the outer room,<br>with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother, and<br>forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed,<br>opened the bedroom door.<br><br>“Is this your saber?” he shouted.<br><br>The girls sprang aside. Denísov hid his hairy legs under the blanket,<br>looking with a scared face at his comrade for help. The door, having let<br>Pétya in, closed again. A sound of laughter came from behind it.<br><br>“Nicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!” said Natásha’s voice.<br><br>“Is this your saber?” asked Pétya. “Or is it yours?” he said,<br>addressing the black-mustached Denísov with servile deference.<br><br>Rostóv hurriedly put something on his feet, drew on his dressing gown,<br>and went out. Natásha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting<br>her foot into the other. Sónya, when he came in, was twirling round and<br>was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down. They were<br>dressed alike, in new pale-blue frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, and<br>bright. Sónya ran away, but Natásha, taking her brother’s arm, led<br>him into the sitting room, where they began talking. They hardly gave<br>one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand<br>little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves. Natásha<br>laughed at every word he said or that she said herself, not because what<br>they were saying was amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable<br>to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter.<br><br>“Oh, how nice, how splendid!” she said to everything.<br><br>Rostóv felt that, under the influence of the warm rays of love, that<br>childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left<br>home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his<br>soul and his face.<br><br>“No, but listen,” she said, “now you are quite a man, aren’t<br>you? I’m awfully glad you’re my brother.” She touched his<br>mustache. “I want to know what you men are like. Are you the same as<br>we? No?”<br><br>“Why did Sónya run away?” asked Rostóv.<br><br>“Ah, yes! That’s a whole long story! How are you going to speak to<br>her—thou or you?”<br><br>“As may happen,” said Rostóv.<br><br>“No, call her you, please! I’ll tell you all about it some other<br>time. No, I’ll tell you now. You know Sónya’s my dearest friend.<br>Such a friend that I burned my arm for her sake. Look here!”<br><br>She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long,<br>slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is covered<br>even by a ball dress.<br><br>“I burned this to prove my love for her. I just heated a ruler in the<br>fire and pressed it there!”<br><br>Sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, in what used<br>to be his old schoolroom, and looking into Natásha’s wildly bright<br>eyes, Rostóv re-entered that world of home and childhood which had no<br>meaning for anyone else, but gave him some of the best joys of his life;<br>and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem<br>to him senseless, he understood and was not surprised at it.<br><br>“Well, and is that all?” he asked.<br><br>“We are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just<br>nonsense, but we are friends forever. She, if she loves anyone, does it<br>for life, but I don’t understand that, I forget quickly.”<br><br>“Well, what then?”<br><br>“Well, she loves me and you like that.”<br><br>Natásha suddenly flushed.<br><br>“Why, you remember before you went away?... Well, she says you are to<br>forget all that.... She says: ‘I shall love him always, but let him be<br>free.’ Isn’t that lovely and noble! Yes, very noble? Isn’t it?”<br>asked Natásha, so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what<br>she was now saying she had talked of before, with tears.<br><br>Rostóv became thoughtful.<br><br>“I never go back on my word,” he said. “Besides, Sónya is so<br>charming that only a fool would renounce such happiness.”<br><br>“No, no!” cried Natásha, “she and I have already talked it over.<br>We knew you’d say so. But it won’t do, because you see, if you say<br>that—if you consider yourself bound by your promise—it will seem as<br>if she had not meant it seriously. It makes it as if you were marrying<br>her because you must, and that wouldn’t do at all.”<br><br>Rostóv saw that it had been well considered by them. Sónya had already<br>struck him by her beauty on the preceding day. Today, when he had caught<br>a glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. She was a charming girl<br>of sixteen, evidently passionately in love with him (he did not doubt<br>that for an instant). Why should he not love her now, and even marry<br>her, Rostóv thought, but just now there were so many other pleasures<br>and interests before him! “Yes, they have taken a wise decision,” he<br>thought, “I must remain free.”<br><br>“Well then, that’s excellent,” said he. “We’ll talk it over<br>later on. Oh, how glad I am to have you!”<br><br>“Well, and are you still true to Borís?” he continued.<br><br>“Oh, what nonsense!” cried Natásha, laughing. “I don’t think<br>about him or anyone else, and I don’t want anything of the kind.”<br><br>“Dear me! Then what are you up to now?”<br><br>“Now?” repeated Natásha, and a happy smile lit up her face. “Have<br>you seen Duport?”<br><br>“No.”<br><br>“Not seen Duport—the famous dancer? Well then, you won’t<br>understand. That’s what I’m up to.”<br><br>Curving her arms, Natásha held out her skirts as dancers do, ran back<br>a few steps, turned, cut a caper, brought her little feet sharply<br>together, and made some steps on the very tips of her toes.<br><br>“See, I’m standing! See!” she said, but could not maintain herself<br>on her toes any longer. “So that’s what I’m up to! I’ll never<br>marry anyone, but will be a dancer. Only don’t tell anyone.”<br><br>Rostóv laughed so loud and merrily that Denísov, in his bedroom, felt<br>envious and Natásha could not help joining in.<br><br>“No, but don’t you think it’s nice?” she kept repeating.<br><br>“Nice! And so you no longer wish to marry Borís?”<br><br>Natásha flared up. “I don’t want to marry anyone. And I’ll tell<br>him so when I see him!”<br><br>“Dear me!” said Rostóv.<br><br>“But that’s all rubbish,” Natásha chattered on. “And is<br>Denísov nice?” she asked.<br><br>“Yes, indeed!”<br><br>“Oh, well then, good-by: go and dress. Is he very terrible,<br>Denísov?”<br><br>“Why terrible?” asked Nicholas. “No, Váska is a splendid<br>fellow.”<br><br>“You call him Váska? That’s funny! And is he very nice?”<br><br>“Very.”<br><br>“Well then, be quick. We’ll all have breakfast together.”<br><br>And Natásha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe, like a ballet<br>dancer, but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile. When<br>Rostóv met Sónya in the drawing room, he reddened. He did not know<br>how to behave with her. The evening before, in the first happy moment of<br>meeting, they had kissed each other, but today they felt it could not<br>be done; he felt that everybody, including his mother and sisters, was<br>looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave<br>with her. He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as<br>you—Sónya. But their eyes met and said thou, and exchanged tender<br>kisses. Her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared, by<br>Natásha’s intermediacy, to remind him of his promise, and then<br>thanked him for his love. His looks thanked her for offering him his<br>freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to<br>love her, for that would be impossible.<br><br>“How strange it is,” said Véra, selecting a moment when all were<br>silent, “that Sónya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet<br>like strangers.”<br><br>Véra’s remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, like<br>most of her observations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, not<br>only Sónya, Nicholas, and Natásha, but even the old countess,<br>who—dreading this love affair which might hinder Nicholas from making<br>a brilliant match—blushed like a girl.<br><br>Denísov, to Rostóv’s surprise, appeared in the drawing room with<br>pomaded hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as smart as<br>he made himself when going into battle, and he was more amiable to the<br>ladies and gentlemen than Rostóv had ever expected to see him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>On his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas Rostóv was welcomed<br>by his home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling<br>Nikólenka; by his relations as a charming, attractive, and polite young<br>man; by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a good<br>dancer, and one of the best matches in the city.<br><br>The Rostóvs knew everybody in Moscow. The old count had money enough<br>that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas,<br>acquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the<br>latest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the<br>latest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs,<br>passed his time very gaily. After a short period of adapting himself<br>to the old conditions of life, Nicholas found it very pleasant to be<br>at home again. He felt that he had grown up and matured very much. His<br>despair at failing in a Scripture examination, his borrowing money from<br>Gavríl to pay a sleigh driver, his kissing Sónya on the sly—he now<br>recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind.<br>Now he was a lieutenant of hussars, in a jacket laced with silver, and<br>wearing the Cross of St. George, awarded to soldiers for bravery in<br>action, and in the company of well-known, elderly, and respected racing<br>men was training a trotter of his own for a race. He knew a lady on one<br>of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led the mazurka<br>at the Arkhárovs’ ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal<br>Kámenski, visited the English Club, and was on intimate terms with a<br>colonel of forty to whom Denísov had introduced him.<br><br>His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow. But still, as<br>he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him, he often spoke<br>about him and about his love for him, letting it be understood that he<br>had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the<br>Emperor not everyone could understand, and with his whole soul he shared<br>the adoration then common in Moscow for the Emperor, who was spoken of<br>as the “angel incarnate.”<br><br>During Rostóv’s short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the army, he<br>did not draw closer to Sónya, but rather drifted away from her. She was<br>very pretty and sweet, and evidently deeply in love with him, but he was<br>at the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no<br>time for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and<br>prizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things. When he<br>thought of Sónya, during this stay in Moscow, he said to himself,<br>“Ah, there will be, and there are, many more such girls somewhere whom<br>I do not yet know. There will be time enough to think about love when I<br>want to, but now I have no time.” Besides, it seemed to him that the<br>society of women was rather derogatory to his manhood. He went to balls<br>and into ladies’ society with an affectation of doing so against his<br>will. The races, the English Club, sprees with Denísov, and visits to<br>a certain house—that was another matter and quite the thing for a<br>dashing young hussar!<br><br>At the beginning of March, old Count Ilyá Rostóv was very busy<br>arranging a dinner in honor of Prince Bagratión at the English Club.<br><br>The count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, giving<br>orders to the club steward and to the famous Feoktíst, the club’s<br>head cook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and<br>fish for this dinner. The count had been a member and on the committee<br>of the club from the day it was founded. To him the club entrusted the<br>arrangement of the festival in honor of Bagratión, for few men knew<br>so well how to arrange a feast on an open-handed, hospitable scale,<br>and still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of<br>their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete.<br>The club cook and the steward listened to the count’s orders with<br>pleased faces, for they knew that under no other management could they<br>so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing<br>several thousand rubles.<br><br>“Well then, mind and have cocks’ comb in the turtle soup, you<br>know!”<br><br>“Shall we have three cold dishes then?” asked the cook.<br><br>The count considered.<br><br>“We can’t have less—yes, three... the mayonnaise, that’s one,”<br>said he, bending down a finger.<br><br>“Then am I to order those large sterlets?” asked the steward.<br><br>“Yes, it can’t be helped if they won’t take less. Ah, dear me! I<br>was forgetting. We must have another entrée. Ah, goodness gracious!”<br>he clutched at his head. “Who is going to get me the flowers? Dmítri!<br>Eh, Dmítri! Gallop off to our Moscow estate,” he said to the factotum<br>who appeared at his call. “Hurry off and tell Maksím, the gardener,<br>to set the serfs to work. Say that everything out of the hothouses must<br>be brought here well wrapped up in felt. I must have two hundred pots<br>here on Friday.”<br><br>Having given several more orders, he was about to go to his “little<br>countess” to have a rest, but remembering something else of<br>importance, he returned again, called back the cook and the club<br>steward, and again began giving orders. A light footstep and the<br>clinking of spurs were heard at the door, and the young count, handsome,<br>rosy, with a dark little mustache, evidently rested and made sleeker by<br>his easy life in Moscow, entered the room.<br><br>“Ah, my boy, my head’s in a whirl!” said the old man with a smile,<br>as if he felt a little confused before his son. “Now, if you would<br>only help a bit! I must have singers too. I shall have my own orchestra,<br>but shouldn’t we get the gypsy singers as well? You military men like<br>that sort of thing.”<br><br>“Really, Papa, I believe Prince Bagratión worried himself less before<br>the battle of Schön Grabern than you do now,” said his son with a<br>smile.<br><br>The old count pretended to be angry.<br><br>“Yes, you talk, but try it yourself!”<br><br>And the count turned to the cook, who, with a shrewd and respectful<br>expression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and<br>son.<br><br>“What have the young people come to nowadays, eh, Feoktíst?” said<br>he. “Laughing at us old fellows!”<br><br>“That’s so, your excellency, all they have to do is to eat a good<br>dinner, but providing it and serving it all up, that’s not their<br>business!”<br><br>“That’s it, that’s it!” exclaimed the count, and gaily seizing<br>his son by both hands, he cried, “Now I’ve got you, so take the<br>sleigh and pair at once, and go to Bezúkhov’s, and tell him ‘Count<br>Ilyá has sent you to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples.’ We<br>can’t get them from anyone else. He’s not there himself, so you’ll<br>have to go in and ask the princesses; and from there go on to the<br>Rasgulyáy—the coachman Ipátka knows—and look up the gypsy<br>Ilyúshka, the one who danced at Count Orlóv’s, you remember, in a<br>white Cossack coat, and bring him along to me.”<br><br>“And am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him?” asked Nicholas,<br>laughing. “Dear, dear!...”<br><br>At that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike,<br>preoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never left her face, Anna<br>Mikháylovna entered the hall. Though she came upon the count in his<br>dressing gown every day, he invariably became confused and begged her to<br>excuse his costume.<br><br>“No matter at all, my dear count,” she said, meekly closing her<br>eyes. “But I’ll go to Bezúkhov’s myself. Pierre has arrived, and<br>now we shall get anything we want from his hothouses. I have to see him<br>in any case. He has forwarded me a letter from Borís. Thank God, Borís<br>is now on the staff.”<br><br>The count was delighted at Anna Mikháylovna’s taking upon herself one<br>of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her.<br><br>“Tell Bezúkhov to come. I’ll put his name down. Is his wife with<br>him?” he asked.<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness was depicted<br>on her face.<br><br>“Ah, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate,” she said. “If what<br>we hear is true, it is dreadful. How little we dreamed of such a thing<br>when we were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul<br>as young Bezúkhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to give<br>him what consolation I can.”<br><br>“Wh-what is the matter?” asked both the young and old Rostóv.<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna sighed deeply.<br><br>“Dólokhov, Mary Ivánovna’s son,” she said in a mysterious<br>whisper, “has compromised her completely, they say. Pierre took him<br>up, invited him to his house in Petersburg, and now... she has come here<br>and that daredevil after her!” said Anna Mikháylovna, wishing to show<br>her sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile<br>betraying her sympathy for the “daredevil,” as she called Dólokhov.<br>“They say Pierre is quite broken by his misfortune.”<br><br>“Dear, dear! But still tell him to come to the club—it will all blow<br>over. It will be a tremendous banquet.”<br><br>Next day, the third of March, soon after one o’clock, two hundred and<br>fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting the<br>guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince Bagratión, to<br>dinner.<br><br>On the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, Moscow had<br>been bewildered. At that time, the Russians were so used to victories<br>that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it,<br>while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an<br>event. In the English Club, where all who were distinguished, important,<br>and well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in<br>December, nothing was said about the war and the last battle, as<br>though all were in a conspiracy of silence. The men who set the tone<br>in conversation—Count Rostopchín, Prince Yúri Dolgorúkov, Valúev,<br>Count Markóv, and Prince Vyázemski—did not show themselves at the<br>club, but met in private houses in intimate circles, and the<br>Moscovites who took their opinions from others—Ilyá Rostóv among<br>them—remained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject<br>of the war and without leaders. The Moscovites felt that something was<br>wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult, and so it was best<br>to be silent. But after a while, just as a jury comes out of its room,<br>the bigwigs who guided the club’s opinion reappeared, and everybody<br>began speaking clearly and definitely. Reasons were found for the<br>incredible, unheard-of, and impossible event of a Russian defeat,<br>everything became clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things<br>began to be said. These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians, a<br>defective commissariat, the treachery of the Pole Przebyszéwski and of<br>the Frenchman Langeron, Kutúzov’s incapacity, and (it was whispered)<br>the youth and inexperience of the sovereign, who had trusted worthless<br>and insignificant people. But the army, the Russian army, everyone<br>declared, was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor. The<br>soldiers, officers, and generals were heroes. But the hero of heroes was<br>Prince Bagratión, distinguished by his Schön Grabern affair and by<br>the retreat from Austerlitz, where he alone had withdrawn his column<br>unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous<br>as his own. What also conduced to Bagratión’s being selected as<br>Moscow’s hero was the fact that he had no connections in the city<br>and was a stranger there. In his person, honor was shown to a simple<br>fighting Russian soldier without connections and intrigues, and to one<br>who was associated by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of<br>Suvórov. Moreover, paying such honor to Bagratión was the best way of<br>expressing disapproval and dislike of Kutúzov.<br><br>“Had there been no Bagratión, it would have been necessary to<br>invent him,” said the wit Shinshín, parodying the words of Voltaire.<br>Kutúzov no one spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers,<br>calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr.<br><br>All Moscow repeated Prince Dolgorúkov’s saying: “If you go on<br>modeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay,” suggesting<br>consolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories; and the<br>words of Rostopchín, that French soldiers have to be incited to battle<br>by highfalutin words, and Germans by logical arguments to show them<br>that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance, but that Russian<br>soldiers only need to be restrained and held back! On all sides, new and<br>fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by<br>our officers and men at Austerlitz. One had saved a standard, another<br>had killed five Frenchmen, a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded.<br>Berg was mentioned, by those who did not know him, as having, when<br>wounded in the right hand, taken his sword in the left, and gone<br>forward. Of Bolkónski, nothing was said, and only those who knew him<br>intimately regretted that he had died so young, leaving a pregnant wife<br>with his eccentric father.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>On that third of March, all the rooms in the English Club were filled<br>with a hum of conversation, like the hum of bees swarming in springtime.<br>The members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither, sat,<br>stood, met, and separated, some in uniform and some in evening dress,<br>and a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaftáns.<br>Powdered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings,<br>stood at every door anxiously noting visitors’ every movement in order<br>to offer their services. Most of those present were elderly, respected<br>men with broad, self-confident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures<br>and voices. This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual<br>places and met in certain habitual groups. A minority of those present<br>were casual guests—chiefly young men, among whom were Denísov,<br>Rostóv, and Dólokhov—who was now again an officer in the Semënov<br>regiment. The faces of these young people, especially those who were<br>military men, bore that expression of condescending respect for their<br>elders which seems to say to the older generation, “We are prepared to<br>respect and honor you, but all the same remember that the future belongs<br>to us.”<br><br>Nesvítski was there as an old member of the club. Pierre, who at his<br>wife’s command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles,<br>went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull. Here,<br>as elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to<br>his wealth, and being in the habit of lording it over these people, he<br>treated them with absent-minded contempt.<br><br>By his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but by his wealth<br>and connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests, and<br>so he went from one group to another. Some of the most important old men<br>were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully<br>to hear the voices of well-known men. The largest circles formed round<br>Count Rostopchín, Valúev, and Narýshkin. Rostopchín was describing<br>how the Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to<br>force their way through them with bayonets.<br><br>Valúev was confidentially telling that Uvárov had been sent from<br>Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz.<br><br>In the third circle, Narýshkin was speaking of the meeting of the<br>Austrian Council of War at which Suvórov crowed like a cock in reply to<br>the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. Shinshín, standing close<br>by, tried to make a joke, saying that Kutúzov had evidently failed to<br>learn from Suvórov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a<br>cock, but the elder members glanced severely at the wit, making him<br>feel that in that place and on that day, it was improper to speak so of<br>Kutúzov.<br><br>Count Ilyá Rostóv, hurried and preoccupied, went about in his soft<br>boots between the dining and drawing rooms, hastily greeting the<br>important and unimportant, all of whom he knew, as if they were all<br>equals, while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine well-set-up<br>young son, resting on him and winking joyfully at him. Young Rostóv<br>stood at a window with Dólokhov, whose acquaintance he had lately<br>made and highly valued. The old count came up to them and pressed<br>Dólokhov’s hand.<br><br>“Please come and visit us... you know my brave boy... been together<br>out there... both playing the hero... Ah, Vasíli Ignátovich...<br>How d’ye do, old fellow?” he said, turning to an old man who was<br>passing, but before he had finished his greeting there was a general<br>stir, and a footman who had run in announced, with a frightened face:<br>“He’s arrived!”<br><br>Bells rang, the stewards rushed forward, and—like rye shaken together<br>in a shovel—the guests who had been scattered about in different rooms<br>came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the<br>ballroom.<br><br>Bagratión appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword,<br>which, in accord with the club custom, he had given up to the hall<br>porter. He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded whip<br>over his shoulder, as when Rostóv had seen him on the eve of the battle<br>of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign<br>Orders, and the Star of St. George on his left breast. Evidently just<br>before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed,<br>which changed his appearance for the worse. There was something naïvely<br>festive in his air, which, in conjunction with his firm and virile<br>features, gave him a rather comical expression. Bekleshëv and Theodore<br>Uvárov, who had arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him,<br>as the guest of honor, to enter first. Bagratión was embarrassed, not<br>wishing to avail himself of their courtesy, and this caused some delay<br>at the doors, but after all he did at last enter first. He walked shyly<br>and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room, not knowing<br>what to do with his hands; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed<br>field under fire, as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at<br>Schön Grabern—and he would have found that easier. The committeemen<br>met him at the first door and, expressing their delight at seeing such a<br>highly honored guest, took possession of him as it were, without waiting<br>for his reply, surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room. It was<br>at first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of<br>members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look<br>at Bagratión over each other’s shoulders, as if he were some rare<br>animal. Count Ilyá Rostóv, laughing and repeating the words, “Make<br>way, dear boy! Make way, make way!” pushed through the crowd more<br>energetically than anyone, led the guests into the drawing room, and<br>seated them on the center sofa. The bigwigs, the most respected members<br>of the club, beset the new arrivals. Count Ilyá, again thrusting his<br>way through the crowd, went out of the drawing room and reappeared a<br>minute later with another committeeman, carrying a large silver salver<br>which he presented to Prince Bagratión. On the salver lay some verses<br>composed and printed in the hero’s honor. Bagratión, on seeing the<br>salver, glanced around in dismay, as though seeking help. But all eyes<br>demanded that he should submit. Feeling himself in their power, he<br>resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and<br>reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him. Someone<br>obligingly took the dish from Bagratión (or he would, it seemed, have<br>held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it) and drew his<br>attention to the verses.<br><br>“Well, I will read them, then!” Bagratión seemed to say, and,<br>fixing his weary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and<br>serious expression. But the author himself took the verses and began<br>reading them aloud. Bagratión bowed his head and listened:<br><br>   Bring glory then to Alexander’s reign<br>   And on the throne our Titus shield.<br>   A dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man,<br>   A Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!<br>   E’en fortunate Napoleon<br>   Knows by experience, now, Bagratión,<br>   And dare not Herculean Russians trouble...<br><br>But before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo announced<br>that dinner was ready! The door opened, and from the dining room came<br>the resounding strains of the polonaise:<br><br>   Conquest’s joyful thunder waken,<br>   Triumph, valiant Russians, now!...<br><br>and Count Rostóv, glancing angrily at the author who went on reading<br>his verses, bowed to Bagratión. Everyone rose, feeling that dinner<br>was more important than verses, and Bagratión, again preceding all the<br>rest, went in to dinner. He was seated in the place of honor between<br>two Alexanders—Bekleshëv and Narýshkin—which was a significant<br>allusion to the name of the sovereign. Three hundred persons took their<br>seats in the dining room, according to their rank and importance: the<br>more important nearer to the honored guest, as naturally as water flows<br>deepest where the land lies lowest.<br><br>Just before dinner, Count Ilyá Rostóv presented his son to Bagratión,<br>who recognized him and said a few words to him, disjointed and awkward,<br>as were all the words he spoke that day, and Count Ilyá looked joyfully<br>and proudly around while Bagratión spoke to his son.<br><br>Nicholas Rostóv, with Denísov and his new acquaintance, Dólokhov, sat<br>almost at the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince<br>Nesvítski. Count Ilyá Rostóv with the other members of the committee<br>sat facing Bagratión and, as the very personification of Moscow<br>hospitality, did the honors to the prince.<br><br>His efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the Lenten and the<br>other fare, was splendid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till the<br>end of the meal. He winked at the butler, whispered directions to the<br>footmen, and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety. Everything<br>was excellent. With the second course, a gigantic sterlet (at sight of<br>which Ilyá Rostóv blushed with self-conscious pleasure), the footmen<br>began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses. After the fish,<br>which made a certain sensation, the count exchanged glances with<br>the other committeemen. “There will be many toasts, it’s time to<br>begin,” he whispered, and taking up his glass, he rose. All were<br>silent, waiting for what he would say.<br><br>“To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!” he cried, and at the<br>same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm.<br>The band immediately struck up “Conquest’s joyful thunder<br>waken...” All rose and cried “Hurrah!” Bagratión also rose and<br>shouted “Hurrah!” in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted<br>it on the field at Schön Grabern. Young Rostóv’s ecstatic voice<br>could be heard above the three hundred others. He nearly wept. “To the<br>health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!” he roared, “Hurrah!” and<br>emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor. Many followed<br>his example, and the loud shouting continued for a long time. When the<br>voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody<br>sat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and exchanging<br>remarks. The old count rose once more, glanced at a note lying beside<br>his plate, and proposed a toast, “To the health of the hero of our<br>last campaign, Prince Peter Ivánovich Bagratión!” and again his blue<br>eyes grew moist. “Hurrah!” cried the three hundred voices again,<br>but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed by Paul<br>Ivánovich Kutúzov:<br><br>   Russians! O’er all barriers on!<br>   Courage conquest guarantees;<br>   Have we not Bagratión?<br>   He brings foemen to their knees,... etc.<br><br>As soon as the singing was over, another and another toast was proposed<br>and Count Ilyá Rostóv became more and more moved, more glass was<br>smashed, and the shouting grew louder. They drank to Bekleshëv,<br>Narýshkin, Uvárov, Dolgorúkov, Apráksin, Valúev, to the committee,<br>to all the club members and to all the club guests, and finally to<br>Count Ilyá Rostóv separately, as the organizer of the banquet. At that<br>toast, the count took out his handkerchief and, covering his face, wept<br>outright.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>Pierre sat opposite Dólokhov and Nicholas Rostóv. As usual, he ate and<br>drank much, and eagerly. But those who knew him intimately noticed that<br>some great change had come over him that day. He was silent all through<br>dinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed eyes and<br>a look of complete absent-mindedness, kept rubbing the bridge of his<br>nose. His face was depressed and gloomy. He seemed to see and hear<br>nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some<br>depressing and unsolved problem.<br><br>The unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the<br>princess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning Dólokhov’s intimacy with<br>his wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning, which<br>in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw<br>badly through his spectacles, but that his wife’s connection with<br>Dólokhov was a secret to no one but himself. Pierre absolutely<br>disbelieved both the princess’ hints and the letter, but he feared<br>now to look at Dólokhov, who was sitting opposite him. Every time<br>he chanced to meet Dólokhov’s handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt<br>something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly<br>away. Involuntarily recalling his wife’s past and her relations with<br>Dólokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be<br>true, or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife.<br>He involuntarily remembered how Dólokhov, who had fully recovered his<br>former position after the campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come<br>to him. Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon<br>companion, Dólokhov had come straight to his house, and Pierre had put<br>him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled how Hélène had smilingly<br>expressed disapproval of Dólokhov’s living at their house, and how<br>cynically Dólokhov had praised his wife’s beauty to him and from that<br>time till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day.<br><br>“Yes, he is very handsome,” thought Pierre, “and I know him. It<br>would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule<br>me, just because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him,<br>and helped him. I know and understand what a spice that would add to the<br>pleasure of deceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, if it were true,<br>but I do not believe it. I have no right to, and can’t, believe it.”<br>He remembered the expression Dólokhov’s face assumed in his moments<br>of cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them<br>into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel without any<br>reason, or shot a post-boy’s horse with a pistol. That expression<br>was often on Dólokhov’s face when looking at him. “Yes, he is a<br>bully,” thought Pierre, “to kill a man means nothing to him. It must<br>seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and that must please him.<br>He must think that I, too, am afraid of him—and in fact I am afraid of<br>him,” he thought, and again he felt something terrible and monstrous<br>rising in his soul. Dólokhov, Denísov, and Rostóv were now sitting<br>opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. Rostóv was talking merrily to his<br>two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious<br>duelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at<br>Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very<br>noticeable one at the dinner. Rostóv looked inimically at Pierre,<br>first because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the<br>husband of a beauty, and in a word—an old woman; and secondly because<br>Pierre in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized<br>Rostóv and had not responded to his greeting. When the Emperor’s<br>health was drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his<br>glass.<br><br>“What are you about?” shouted Rostóv, looking at him in an ecstasy<br>of exasperation. “Don’t you hear it’s His Majesty the Emperor’s<br>health?”<br><br>Pierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, waiting till<br>all were seated again, turned with his kindly smile to Rostóv.<br><br>“Why, I didn’t recognize you!” he said. But Rostóv was otherwise<br>engaged; he was shouting “Hurrah!”<br><br>“Why don’t you renew the acquaintance?” said Dólokhov to Rostóv.<br><br>“Confound him, he’s a fool!” said Rostóv.<br><br>“One should make up to the husbands of pretty women,” said Denísov.<br><br>Pierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were talking<br>about him. He reddened and turned away.<br><br>“Well, now to the health of handsome women!” said Dólokhov, and<br>with a serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of<br>his mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre.<br><br>“Here’s to the health of lovely women, Peterkin—and their<br>lovers!” he added.<br><br>Pierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking at<br>Dólokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing leaflets<br>with Kutúzov’s cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the<br>principal guests. He was just going to take it when Dólokhov, leaning<br>across, snatched it from his hand and began reading it. Pierre looked<br>at Dólokhov and his eyes dropped, the something terrible and monstrous<br>that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him.<br>He leaned his whole massive body across the table.<br><br>“How dare you take it?” he shouted.<br><br>Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nesvítski and the<br>neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bezúkhov.<br><br>“Don’t! Don’t! What are you about?” whispered their frightened<br>voices.<br><br>Dólokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that<br>smile of his which seemed to say, “Ah! This is what I like!”<br><br>“You shan’t have it!” he said distinctly.<br><br>Pale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.<br><br>“You...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!” he ejaculated, and,<br>pushing back his chair, he rose from the table.<br><br>At the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt<br>that the question of his wife’s guilt which had been tormenting him<br>the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative.<br>He hated her and was forever sundered from her. Despite Denísov’s<br>request that he would take no part in the matter, Rostóv agreed to be<br>Dólokhov’s second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for<br>the duel with Nesvítski, Bezúkhov’s second. Pierre went home, but<br>Rostóv with Dólokhov and Denísov stayed on at the club till late,<br>listening to the gypsies and other singers.<br><br>“Well then, till tomorrow at Sokólniki,” said Dólokhov, as he took<br>leave of Rostóv in the club porch.<br><br>“And do you feel quite calm?” Rostóv asked.<br><br>Dólokhov paused.<br><br>“Well, you see, I’ll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two<br>words. If you are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write<br>affectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be<br>killed, you are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the firm<br>intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible, and<br>then all will be right, as our bear huntsman at Kostromá used to tell<br>me. ‘Everyone fears a bear,’ he says, ‘but when you see one your<br>fear’s all gone, and your only thought is not to let him get away!’<br>And that’s how it is with me. À demain, mon cher.” *<br><br>    * Till tomorrow, my dear fellow.<br><br>Next day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesvítski drove to the<br>Sokólniki forest and found Dólokhov, Denísov, and Rostóv already<br>there. Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which<br>had no connection with the matter in hand. His haggard face was yellow.<br>He had evidently not slept that night. He looked about distractedly and<br>screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He was entirely absorbed<br>by two considerations: his wife’s guilt, of which after his sleepless<br>night he had not the slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of<br>Dólokhov, who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was<br>nothing to him.... “I should perhaps have done the same thing in his<br>place,” thought Pierre. “It’s even certain that I should have done<br>the same, then why this duel, this murder? Either I shall kill him, or<br>he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee. Can’t I go away from<br>here, run away, bury myself somewhere?” passed through his mind. But<br>just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him, he would ask in a<br>particularly calm and absent-minded way, which inspired the respect of<br>the onlookers, “Will it be long? Are things ready?”<br><br>When all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers,<br>and the pistols loaded, Nesvítski went up to Pierre.<br><br>“I should not be doing my duty, Count,” he said in timid tones,<br>“and should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done<br>me in choosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very<br>grave, moment I did not tell you the whole truth. I think there is no<br>sufficient ground for this affair, or for blood to be shed over it....<br>You were not right, not quite in the right, you were impetuous...”<br><br>“Oh yes, it is horribly stupid,” said Pierre.<br><br>“Then allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your opponent<br>will accept them,” said Nesvítski (who like the others concerned in<br>the affair, and like everyone in similar cases, did not yet believe that<br>the affair had come to an actual duel). “You know, Count, it is much<br>more honorable to admit one’s mistake than to let matters become<br>irreparable. There was no insult on either side. Allow me to<br>convey....”<br><br>“No! What is there to talk about?” said Pierre. “It’s all the<br>same.... Is everything ready?” he added. “Only tell me where to go<br>and where to shoot,” he said with an unnaturally gentle smile.<br><br>He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the<br>trigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his hand—a fact that he<br>did not wish to confess.<br><br>“Oh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot,” said he.<br><br>“No apologies, none whatever,” said Dólokhov to Denísov (who on<br>his side had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to<br>the appointed place.<br><br>The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road,<br>where the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine forest<br>covered with melting snow, the frost having begun to break up during the<br>last few days. The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther<br>edge of the clearing. The seconds, measuring the paces, left tracks in<br>the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and<br>Nesvítski’s and Dólokhov’s sabers, which were stuck into the<br>ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier. It was thawing and misty; at<br>forty paces’ distance nothing could be seen. For three minutes all had<br>been ready, but they still delayed and all were silent.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>“Well begin!” said Dólokhov.<br><br>“All right,” said Pierre, still smiling in the same way. A feeling<br>of dread was in the air. It was evident that the affair so lightly begun<br>could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of<br>men’s will.<br><br>Denísov first went to the barrier and announced: “As the<br>adve’sawies have wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed. Take your<br>pistols, and at the word thwee begin to advance.<br><br>“O-ne! T-wo! Thwee!” he shouted angrily and stepped aside.<br><br>The combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and nearer to<br>one another, beginning to see one another through the mist. They had the<br>right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier. Dólokhov<br>walked slowly without raising his pistol, looking intently with his<br>bright, sparkling blue eyes into his antagonist’s face. His mouth wore<br>its usual semblance of a smile.<br><br>“So I can fire when I like!” said Pierre, and at the word<br>“three,” he went quickly forward, missing the trodden path and<br>stepping into the deep snow. He held the pistol in his right hand at<br>arm’s length, apparently afraid of shooting himself with it. His left<br>hand he held carefully back, because he wished to support his right<br>hand with it and knew he must not do so. Having advanced six paces and<br>strayed off the track into the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet,<br>then quickly glanced at Dólokhov and, bending his finger as he had been<br>shown, fired. Not at all expecting so loud a report, Pierre shuddered<br>at the sound and then, smiling at his own sensations, stood still. The<br>smoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him from seeing anything<br>for an instant, but there was no second report as he had expected. He<br>only heard Dólokhov’s hurried steps, and his figure came in view<br>through the smoke. He was pressing one hand to his left side, while<br>the other clutched his drooping pistol. His face was pale. Rostóv ran<br>toward him and said something.<br><br>“No-o-o!” muttered Dólokhov through his teeth, “no, it’s not<br>over.” And after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the<br>saber, he sank on the snow beside it. His left hand was bloody; he wiped<br>it on his coat and supported himself with it. His frowning face was<br>pallid and quivered.<br><br>“Plea...” began Dólokhov, but could not at first pronounce the<br>word.<br><br>“Please,” he uttered with an effort.<br><br>Pierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began running toward Dólokhov and<br>was about to cross the space between the barriers, when Dólokhov cried:<br><br>“To your barrier!” and Pierre, grasping what was meant, stopped by<br>his saber. Only ten paces divided them. Dólokhov lowered his head to<br>the snow, greedily bit at it, again raised his head, adjusted himself,<br>drew in his legs and sat up, seeking a firm center of gravity. He sucked<br>and swallowed the cold snow, his lips quivered but his eyes, still<br>smiling, glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his<br>remaining strength. He raised his pistol and aimed.<br><br>“Sideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!” ejaculated Nesvítski.<br><br>“Cover yourself!” even Denísov cried to his adversary.<br><br>Pierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and legs<br>helplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly facing<br>Dólokhov and looked sorrowfully at him. Denísov, Rostóv, and<br>Nesvítski closed their eyes. At the same instant they heard a report<br>and Dólokhov’s angry cry.<br><br>“Missed!” shouted Dólokhov, and he lay helplessly, face downwards<br>on the snow.<br><br>Pierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the forest,<br>trampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent words:<br><br>“Folly... folly! Death... lies...” he repeated, puckering his face.<br><br>Nesvítski stopped him and took him home.<br><br>Rostóv and Denísov drove away with the wounded Dólokhov.<br><br>The latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer<br>a word to the questions addressed to him. But on entering Moscow he<br>suddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort, took Rostóv, who<br>was sitting beside him, by the hand. Rostóv was struck by the<br>totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on<br>Dólokhov’s face.<br><br>“Well? How do you feel?” he asked.<br><br>“Bad! But it’s not that, my friend—” said Dólokhov with a<br>gasping voice. “Where are we? In Moscow, I know. I don’t matter,<br>but I have killed her, killed... She won’t get over it! She won’t<br>survive....”<br><br>“Who?” asked Rostóv.<br><br>“My mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother,” and<br>Dólokhov pressed Rostóv’s hand and burst into tears.<br><br>When he had become a little quieter, he explained to Rostóv that he was<br>living with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not survive it.<br>He implored Rostóv to go on and prepare her.<br><br>Rostóv went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise<br>learned that Dólokhov the brawler, Dólokhov the bully, lived in Moscow<br>with an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most affectionate<br>of sons and brothers.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg and in<br>Moscow their house was always full of visitors. The night after the<br>duel he did not go to his bedroom but, as he often did, remained in his<br>father’s room, that huge room in which Count Bezúkhov had died.<br><br>He lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that<br>had happened to him, but could not do so. Such a storm of feelings,<br>thoughts, and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall<br>asleep, nor even remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace the<br>room with rapid steps. Now he seemed to see her in the early days of<br>their marriage, with bare shoulders and a languid, passionate look on<br>her face, and then immediately he saw beside her Dólokhov’s handsome,<br>insolent, hard, and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet, and<br>then that same face pale, quivering, and suffering, as it had been when<br>he reeled and sank on the snow.<br><br>“What has happened?” he asked himself. “I have killed her lover,<br>yes, killed my wife’s lover. Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come<br>to do it?”—“Because you married her,” answered an inner voice.<br><br>“But in what was I to blame?” he asked. “In marrying her without<br>loving her; in deceiving yourself and her.” And he vividly recalled<br>that moment after supper at Prince Vasíli’s, when he spoke those<br>words he had found so difficult to utter: “I love you.” “It all<br>comes from that! Even then I felt it,” he thought. “I felt then that<br>it was not so, that I had no right to do it. And so it turns out.”<br><br>He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection.<br>Particularly vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection of<br>how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his<br>study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head<br>steward there, who, bowing respectfully, looked into his face and at<br>his dressing gown and smiled slightly, as if expressing respectful<br>understanding of his employer’s happiness.<br><br>“But how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her majestic beauty<br>and social tact,” thought he; “been proud of my house, in which she<br>received all Petersburg, proud of her unapproachability and beauty. So<br>this is what I was proud of! I then thought that I did not understand<br>her. How often when considering her character I have told myself that<br>I was to blame for not understanding her, for not understanding that<br>constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires,<br>and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved<br>woman. Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become<br>clear.<br><br>“Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her<br>naked shoulders. She did not give him the money, but let herself be<br>kissed. Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she replied<br>with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: ‘Let<br>him do what he pleases,’ she used to say of me. One day I asked her if<br>she felt any symptoms of pregnancy. She laughed contemptuously and said<br>she was not a fool to want to have children, and that she was not going<br>to have any children by me.”<br><br>Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the<br>vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though she had<br>been brought up in the most aristocratic circles.<br><br>“I’m not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allez-vous<br>promener,” * she used to say. Often seeing the success she had with<br>young and old men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not<br>love her.<br><br>    * “You clear out of this.”<br><br><br>“Yes, I never loved her,” said he to himself; “I knew she was a<br>depraved woman,” he repeated, “but dared not admit it to myself.<br>And now there’s Dólokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and<br>perhaps dying, while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado!”<br><br>Pierre was one of those people who, in spite of an appearance of what<br>is called weak character, do not seek a confidant in their troubles. He<br>digested his sufferings alone.<br><br>“It is all, all her fault,” he said to himself; “but what of that?<br>Why did I bind myself to her? Why did I say ‘Je vous aime’ * to her,<br>which was a lie, and worse than a lie? I am guilty and must endure...<br>what? A slur on my name? A misfortune for life? Oh, that’s<br>nonsense,” he thought. “The slur on my name and honor—that’s all<br>apart from myself.”<br><br>    * I love you.<br><br>“Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a<br>criminal,” came into Pierre’s head, “and from their point of<br>view they were right, as were those too who canonized him and died a<br>martyr’s death for his sake. Then Robespierre was beheaded for being<br>a despot. Who is right and who is wrong? No one! But if you are<br>alive—live: tomorrow you’ll die as I might have died an hour ago.<br>And is it worth tormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life<br>in comparison with eternity?”<br><br>But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections,<br>she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had<br>most strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he felt the<br>blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break<br>and tear whatever came to his hand. “Why did I tell her that ‘Je<br>vous aime’?” he kept repeating to himself. And when he had said it<br>for the tenth time, Molière’s words: “Mais que diable allait-il<br>faire dans cette galère?” * occurred to him, and he began to laugh at<br>himself.<br><br>      * “But what the devil was he doing in that galley?”<br><br><br>In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to<br>Petersburg. He could not imagine how he could speak to her now. He<br>resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his<br>intention to part from her forever.<br><br>Next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee, Pierre<br>was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand.<br><br>He woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression,<br>unable to realize where he was.<br><br>“The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at<br>home,” said the valet.<br><br>But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the countess<br>herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with<br>simply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like<br>a coronet) entered the room, calm and majestic, except that there was<br>a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow. With her<br>imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet.<br>She knew of the duel and had come to speak about it. She waited till the<br>valet had set down the coffee things and left the room. Pierre looked<br>at her timidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds<br>who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her<br>enemies, he tried to continue reading. But feeling this to be senseless<br>and impossible, he again glanced timidly at her. She did not sit down<br>but looked at him with a contemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to<br>go.<br><br>“Well, what’s this now? What have you been up to now, I should like<br>to know?” she asked sternly.<br><br>“I? What have I...?” stammered Pierre.<br><br>“So it seems you’re a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel about?<br>What is it meant to prove? What? I ask you.”<br><br>Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but<br>could not reply.<br><br>“If you won’t answer, I’ll tell you...” Hélène went on. “You<br>believe everything you’re told. You were told...” Hélène laughed,<br>“that Dólokhov was my lover,” she said in French with her coarse<br>plainness of speech, uttering the word amant as casually as any other<br>word, “and you believed it! Well, what have you proved? What does this<br>duel prove? That you’re a fool, que vous êtes un sot, but everybody<br>knew that. What will be the result? That I shall be the laughingstock of<br>all Moscow, that everyone will say that you, drunk and not knowing what<br>you were about, challenged a man you are jealous of without cause.”<br>Hélène raised her voice and became more and more excited, “A man<br>who’s a better man than you in every way...”<br><br>“Hm... Hm...!” growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her, and<br>not moving a muscle.<br><br>“And how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like<br>his company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should prefer<br>yours.”<br><br>“Don’t speak to me... I beg you,” muttered Pierre hoarsely.<br><br>“Why shouldn’t I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you<br>plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who<br>would not have taken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so,”<br>said she.<br><br>Pierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose strange<br>expression she did not understand, and lay down again. He was suffering<br>physically at that moment, there was a weight on his chest and he could<br>not breathe. He knew that he must do something to put an end to this<br>suffering, but what he wanted to do was too terrible.<br><br>“We had better separate,” he muttered in a broken voice.<br><br>“Separate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune,” said<br>Hélène. “Separate! That’s a thing to frighten me with!”<br><br>Pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her.<br><br>“I’ll kill you!” he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table<br>with a strength he had never before felt, he made a step toward her<br>brandishing the slab.<br><br>Hélène’s face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside. His<br>father’s nature showed itself in Pierre. He felt the fascination and<br>delight of frenzy. He flung down the slab, broke it, and swooping<br>down on her with outstretched hands shouted, “Get out!” in such a<br>terrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror. God knows what<br>he would have done at that moment had Hélène not fled from the room.<br><br><br>A week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates<br>in Great Russia, which formed the larger part of his property, and left<br>for Petersburg alone.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>Two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of Austerlitz and<br>the loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills, and in spite of the<br>letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made, his body had<br>not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners. What was worst of<br>all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of<br>his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the<br>place and that he might now be lying, recovering or dying, alone among<br>strangers and unable to send news of himself. The gazettes from which<br>the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual<br>very briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians<br>had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The<br>old prince understood from this official report that our army had been<br>defeated. A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz<br>came a letter from Kutúzov informing the prince of the fate that had<br>befallen his son.<br><br>“Your son,” wrote Kutúzov, “fell before my eyes, a standard in<br>his hand and at the head of a regiment—he fell as a hero, worthy of<br>his father and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the<br>whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort<br>myself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise<br>he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of<br>battle, a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce.”<br><br>After receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his<br>study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he<br>was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though<br>he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.<br><br>When Princess Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his<br>lathe and, as usual, did not look round at her.<br><br>“Ah, Princess Mary!” he said suddenly in an unnatural voice,<br>throwing down his chisel. (The wheel continued to revolve by its own<br>impetus, and Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that<br>wheel, which merged in her memory with what followed.)<br><br>She approached him, saw his face, and something gave way within her. Her<br>eyes grew dim. By the expression of her father’s face, not sad, not<br>crushed, but angry and working unnaturally, she saw that hanging over<br>her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune, the worst<br>in life, one she had not yet experienced, irreparable and<br>incomprehensible—the death of one she loved.<br><br>“Father! Andrew!”—said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such<br>an indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father<br>could not bear her look but turned away with a sob.<br><br>“Bad news! He’s not among the prisoners nor among the killed!<br>Kutúzov writes...” and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to<br>drive the princess away by that scream... “Killed!”<br><br>The princess did not fall down or faint. She was already pale, but on<br>hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her<br>beautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joy—a supreme joy apart from the<br>joys and sorrows of this world—overflowed the great grief within her.<br>She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and<br>drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck.<br><br>“Father,” she said, “do not turn away from me, let us weep<br>together.”<br><br>“Scoundrels! Blackguards!” shrieked the old man, turning his face<br>away from her. “Destroying the army, destroying the men! And why? Go,<br>go and tell Lise.”<br><br>The princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and<br>wept. She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took<br>leave of her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud. She saw him tender<br>and amused as he was when he put on the little icon. “Did he believe?<br>Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms<br>of eternal peace and blessedness?” she thought.<br><br>“Father, tell me how it happened,” she asked through her tears.<br><br>“Go! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and<br>Russia’s glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell<br>Lise. I will follow.”<br><br>When Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat<br>working and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy calm<br>peculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did not see<br>Princess Mary but were looking within... into herself... at something<br>joyful and mysterious taking place within her.<br><br>“Mary,” she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying<br>back, “give me your hand.” She took her sister-in-law’s hand and<br>held it below her waist.<br><br>Her eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained<br>lifted in childlike happiness.<br><br>Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her<br>sister-in-law’s dress.<br><br>“There, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know,<br>Mary, I am going to love him very much,” said Lise, looking with<br>bright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law.<br><br>Princess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping.<br><br>“What is the matter, Mary?”<br><br>“Nothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew,” she said, wiping<br>away her tears on her sister-in-law’s knee.<br><br>Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to<br>prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry. Unobservant as<br>was the little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not<br>understand, agitated her. She said nothing but looked about uneasily as<br>if in search of something. Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was<br>always afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign<br>expression and went out again without saying a word. She looked at<br>Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that expression of<br>attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women,<br>and suddenly began to cry.<br><br>“Has anything come from Andrew?” she asked.<br><br>“No, you know it’s too soon for news. But my father is anxious and I<br>feel afraid.”<br><br>“So there’s nothing?”<br><br>“Nothing,” answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her radiant<br>eyes at her sister-in-law.<br><br>She had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the<br>terrible news from her till after her confinement, which was expected<br>within a few days. Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid<br>their grief in their own way. The old prince would not cherish any hope:<br>he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed, and though he<br>sent an official to Austria to seek for traces of his son, he ordered a<br>monument from Moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his<br>memory, and he told everybody that his son had been killed. He tried not<br>to change his former way of life, but his strength failed him. He walked<br>less, ate less, slept less, and became weaker every day. Princess Mary<br>hoped. She prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news<br>of his return.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>“Dearest,” said the little princess after breakfast on the morning<br>of the nineteenth March, and her downy little lip rose from old habit,<br>but as sorrow was manifest in every smile, the sound of every word, and<br>even every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come, so<br>now the smile of the little princess—influenced by the general mood<br>though without knowing its cause—was such as to remind one still more<br>of the general sorrow.<br><br>“Dearest, I’m afraid this morning’s fruschtique *—as Fóka the<br>cook calls it—has disagreed with me.”<br><br>    * Frühstück: breakfast.<br><br>“What is the matter with you, my darling? You look pale. Oh, you<br>are very pale!” said Princess Mary in alarm, running with her soft,<br>ponderous steps up to her sister-in-law.<br><br>“Your excellency, should not Mary Bogdánovna be sent for?” said one<br>of the maids who was present. (Mary Bogdánovna was a midwife from the<br>neighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last fortnight.)<br><br>“Oh yes,” assented Princess Mary, “perhaps that’s it. I’ll go.<br>Courage, my angel.” She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.<br><br>“Oh, no, no!” And besides the pallor and the physical suffering<br>on the little princess’ face, an expression of childish fear of<br>inevitable pain showed itself.<br><br>“No, it’s only indigestion?... Say it’s only indigestion, say so,<br>Mary! Say...” And the little princess began to cry capriciously like<br>a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some<br>affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary<br>Bogdánovna.<br><br>“Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!” she heard as she left the room.<br><br>The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump<br>white hands with an air of calm importance.<br><br>“Mary Bogdánovna, I think it’s beginning!” said Princess Mary<br>looking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm.<br><br>“Well, the Lord be thanked, Princess,” said Mary Bogdánovna, not<br>hastening her steps. “You young ladies should not know anything about<br>it.”<br><br>“But how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?” said the<br>princess. (In accordance with Lise’s and Prince Andrew’s wishes they<br>had sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at<br>any moment.)<br><br>“No matter, Princess, don’t be alarmed,” said Mary Bogdánovna.<br>“We’ll manage very well without a doctor.”<br><br>Five minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy<br>being carried by. She looked out. The men servants were carrying the<br>large leather sofa from Prince Andrew’s study into the bedroom. On<br>their faces was a quiet and solemn look.<br><br>Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the<br>house, now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching<br>what was going on in the passage. Some women passing with quiet steps in<br>and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away. She did<br>not venture to ask any questions, and shut the door again, now sitting<br>down in her easy chair, now taking her prayer book, now kneeling before<br>the icon stand. To her surprise and distress she found that her prayers<br>did not calm her excitement. Suddenly her door opened softly and her old<br>nurse, Praskóvya Sávishna, who hardly ever came to that room as the<br>old prince had forbidden it, appeared on the threshold with a shawl<br>round her head.<br><br>“I’ve come to sit with you a bit, Másha,” said the nurse, “and<br>here I’ve brought the prince’s wedding candles to light before his<br>saint, my angel,” she said with a sigh.<br><br>“Oh, nurse, I’m so glad!”<br><br>“God is merciful, birdie.”<br><br>The nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door<br>with her knitting. Princess Mary took a book and began reading. Only<br>when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another, the<br>princess anxious and inquiring, the nurse encouraging. Everyone in the<br>house was dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced<br>as she sat in her room. But owing to the superstition that the fewer<br>the people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers, everyone<br>tried to pretend not to know; no one spoke of it, but apart from the<br>ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the prince’s<br>household, a common anxiety, a softening of the heart, and a<br>consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished<br>at that moment made itself felt.<br><br>There was no laughter in the maids’ large hall. In the men servants’<br>hall all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfs’<br>quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept. The old<br>prince, stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study and sent<br>Tíkhon to ask Mary Bogdánovna what news.—“Say only that ‘the<br>prince told me to ask,’ and come and tell me her answer.”<br><br>“Inform the prince that labor has begun,” said Mary Bogdánovna,<br>giving the messenger a significant look.<br><br>Tíkhon went and told the prince.<br><br>“Very good!” said the prince closing the door behind him, and<br>Tíkhon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.<br><br>After a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, and, seeing<br>the prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his perturbed<br>face, shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed him on the<br>shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he<br>had entered. The most solemn mystery in the world continued its course.<br>Evening passed, night came, and the feeling of suspense and softening of<br>heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased.<br>No one slept.<br><br>It was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume its<br>sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury. A relay<br>of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German doctor from<br>Moscow who was expected every moment, and men on horseback with lanterns<br>were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its<br>hollows and snow-covered pools of water.<br><br>Princess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, her<br>luminous eyes fixed on her nurse’s wrinkled face (every line of which<br>she knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the<br>kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.<br><br>Nurse Sávishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, scarcely<br>hearing or understanding her own words, what she had told hundreds of<br>times before: how the late princess had given birth to Princess Mary<br>in Kishenëv with only a Moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a<br>midwife.<br><br>“God is merciful, doctors are never needed,” she said.<br><br>Suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the<br>window, from which the double frame had been removed (by order of the<br>prince, one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks<br>returned), and, forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the damask<br>curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill, snowy draft.<br>Princess Mary shuddered; her nurse, putting down the stocking she was<br>knitting, went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open<br>casement. The cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose<br>locks of gray hair.<br><br>“Princess, my dear, there’s someone driving up the avenue!” she<br>said, holding the casement and not closing it. “With lanterns. Most<br>likely the doctor.”<br><br>“Oh, my God! thank God!” said Princess Mary. “I must go and meet<br>him, he does not know Russian.”<br><br>Princess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer.<br>As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage<br>with lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went out on the stairs. On<br>a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft. On<br>the landing below, Philip, the footman, stood looking scared and holding<br>another candle. Still lower, beyond the turn of the staircase, one<br>could hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots, and a voice that<br>seemed familiar to Princess Mary was saying something.<br><br>“Thank God!” said the voice. “And Father?”<br><br>“Gone to bed,” replied the voice of Demyán the house steward, who<br>was downstairs.<br><br>Then the voice said something more, Demyán replied, and the steps in<br>the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly.<br><br>“It’s Andrew!” thought Princess Mary. “No it can’t be, that<br>would be too extraordinary,” and at the very moment she thought this,<br>the face and figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur cloak the deep collar of<br>which covered with snow, appeared on the landing where the footman<br>stood with the candle. Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed and<br>strangely softened but agitated expression on his face. He came up the<br>stairs and embraced his sister.<br><br>“You did not get my letter?” he asked, and not waiting for a<br>reply—which he would not have received, for the princess was unable to<br>speak—he turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs again with the<br>doctor who had entered the hall after him (they had met at the last post<br>station), and again embraced his sister.<br><br>“What a strange fate, Másha darling!” And having taken off his<br>cloak and felt boots, he went to the little princess’ apartment.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>The little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white cap on her<br>head (the pains had just left her). Strands of her black hair lay round<br>her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy mouth with its<br>downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully. Prince Andrew entered<br>and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying.<br>Her glittering eyes, filled with childlike fear and excitement, rested<br>on him without changing their expression. “I love you all and have<br>done no harm to anyone; why must I suffer so? Help me!” her look<br>seemed to say. She saw her husband, but did not realize the significance<br>of his appearance before her now. Prince Andrew went round the sofa and<br>kissed her forehead.<br><br>“My darling!” he said—a word he had never used to her before.<br>“God is merciful....”<br><br>She looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.<br><br>“I expected help from you and I get none, none from you either!”<br>said her eyes. She was not surprised at his having come; she did<br>not realize that he had come. His coming had nothing to do with<br>her sufferings or with their relief. The pangs began again and Mary<br>Bogdánovna advised Prince Andrew to leave the room.<br><br>The doctor entered. Prince Andrew went out and, meeting Princess Mary,<br>again joined her. They began talking in whispers, but their talk broke<br>off at every moment. They waited and listened.<br><br>“Go, dear,” said Princess Mary.<br><br>Prince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next<br>to hers. A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became<br>confused when she saw Prince Andrew. He covered his face with his hands<br>and remained so for some minutes. Piteous, helpless, animal moans came<br>through the door. Prince Andrew got up, went to the door, and tried to<br>open it. Someone was holding it shut.<br><br>“You can’t come in! You can’t!” said a terrified voice from<br>within.<br><br>He began pacing the room. The screaming ceased, and a few more seconds<br>went by. Then suddenly a terrible shriek—it could not be hers, she<br>could not scream like that—came from the bedroom. Prince Andrew ran to<br>the door; the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant.<br><br>“What have they taken a baby in there for?” thought Prince Andrew in<br>the first second. “A baby? What baby...? Why is there a baby there? Or<br>is the baby born?”<br><br>Then suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail; tears<br>choked him, and leaning his elbows on the window sill he began to cry,<br>sobbing like a child. The door opened. The doctor with his shirt sleeves<br>tucked up, without a coat, pale and with a trembling jaw, came out<br>of the room. Prince Andrew turned to him, but the doctor gave him a<br>bewildered look and passed by without a word. A woman rushed out and<br>seeing Prince Andrew stopped, hesitating on the threshold. He went into<br>his wife’s room. She was lying dead, in the same position he had seen<br>her in five minutes before and, despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of<br>the cheeks, the same expression was on her charming childlike face with<br>its upper lip covered with tiny black hair.<br><br>“I love you all, and have done no harm to anyone; and what have you<br>done to me?”—said her charming, pathetic, dead face.<br><br>In a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed<br>in Mary Bogdánovna’s trembling white hands.<br><br><br>Two hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into his father’s<br>room. The old man already knew everything. He was standing close to<br>the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise<br>round his son’s neck, and without a word he began to sob like a child.<br><br><br>Three days later the little princess was buried, and Prince Andrew went<br>up the steps to where the coffin stood, to give her the farewell kiss.<br>And there in the coffin was the same face, though with closed eyes.<br>“Ah, what have you done to me?” it still seemed to say, and Prince<br>Andrew felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty<br>of a sin he could neither remedy nor forget. He could not weep. The<br>old man too came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly<br>crossed one on the other on her breast, and to him, too, her face seemed<br>to say: “Ah, what have you done to me, and why?” And at the sight<br>the old man turned angrily away.<br><br><br>Another five days passed, and then the young Prince Nicholas Andréevich<br>was baptized. The wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin, while<br>the priest with a goose feather anointed the boy’s little red and<br>wrinkled soles and palms.<br><br>His grandfather, who was his godfather, trembling and afraid of dropping<br>him, carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over<br>to the godmother, Princess Mary. Prince Andrew sat in another room,<br>faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font, and awaited<br>the termination of the ceremony. He looked up joyfully at the baby when<br>the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that<br>the wax with the baby’s hair had not sunk in the font but had floated.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>Rostóv’s share in Dólokhov’s duel with Bezúkhov was hushed up by<br>the efforts of the old count, and instead of being degraded to the ranks<br>as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of<br>Moscow. As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the<br>family, but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties. Dólokhov<br>recovered, and Rostóv became very friendly with him during his<br>convalescence. Dólokhov lay ill at his mother’s who loved him<br>passionately and tenderly, and old Mary Ivánovna, who had grown fond of<br>Rostóv for his friendship to her Fédya, often talked to him about her<br>son.<br><br>“Yes, Count,” she would say, “he is too noble and pure-souled for<br>our present, depraved world. No one now loves virtue; it seems like<br>a reproach to everyone. Now tell me, Count, was it right, was it<br>honorable, of Bezúkhov? And Fédya, with his noble spirit, loved him<br>and even now never says a word against him. Those pranks in Petersburg<br>when they played some tricks on a policeman, didn’t they do it<br>together? And there! Bezúkhov got off scotfree, while Fédya had to<br>bear the whole burden on his shoulders. Fancy what he had to go through!<br>It’s true he has been reinstated, but how could they fail to do that?<br>I think there were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out<br>there as he. And now—this duel! Have these people no feeling, or<br>honor? Knowing him to be an only son, to challenge him and shoot so<br>straight! It’s well God had mercy on us. And what was it for? Who<br>doesn’t have intrigues nowadays? Why, if he was so jealous, as I see<br>things he should have shown it sooner, but he lets it go on for months.<br>And then to call him out, reckoning on Fédya not fighting because he<br>owed him money! What baseness! What meanness! I know you understand<br>Fédya, my dear count; that, believe me, is why I am so fond of you. Few<br>people do understand him. He is such a lofty, heavenly soul!”<br><br>Dólokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to Rostóv in a way no<br>one would have expected of him.<br><br>“I know people consider me a bad man!” he said. “Let them! I<br>don’t care a straw about anyone but those I love; but those I love,<br>I love so that I would give my life for them, and the others I’d<br>throttle if they stood in my way. I have an adored, a priceless mother,<br>and two or three friends—you among them—and as for the rest I only<br>care about them in so far as they are harmful or useful. And most of<br>them are harmful, especially the women. Yes, dear boy,” he continued,<br>“I have met loving, noble, high-minded men, but I have not yet met<br>any women—countesses or cooks—who were not venal. I have not yet met<br>that divine purity and devotion I look for in women. If I found such a<br>one I’d give my life for her! But those!...” and he made a gesture<br>of contempt. “And believe me, if I still value my life it is<br>only because I still hope to meet such a divine creature, who will<br>regenerate, purify, and elevate me. But you don’t understand it.”<br><br>“Oh, yes, I quite understand,” answered Rostóv, who was under his<br>new friend’s influence.<br><br>In the autumn the Rostóvs returned to Moscow. Early in the winter<br>Denísov also came back and stayed with them. The first half of the<br>winter of 1806, which Nicholas Rostóv spent in Moscow, was one of the<br>happiest, merriest times for him and the whole family. Nicholas brought<br>many young men to his parents’ house. Véra was a handsome girl<br>of twenty; Sónya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening<br>flower; Natásha, half grown up and half child, was now childishly<br>amusing, now girlishly enchanting.<br><br>At that time in the Rostóvs’ house there prevailed an amorous<br>atmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and very<br>charming girls. Every young man who came to the house—seeing those<br>impressionable, smiling young faces (smiling probably at their own<br>happiness), feeling the eager bustle around him, and hearing the fitful<br>bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of<br>young girls ready for anything and full of hope—experienced the same<br>feeling; sharing with the young folk of the Rostóvs’ household a<br>readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness.<br><br>Among the young men introduced by Rostóv one of the first was<br>Dólokhov, whom everyone in the house liked except Natásha. She almost<br>quarreled with her brother about him. She insisted that he was a bad<br>man, and that in the duel with Bezúkhov, Pierre was right and Dólokhov<br>wrong, and further that he was disagreeable and unnatural.<br><br>“There’s nothing for me to understand,” she cried out with<br>resolute self-will, “he is wicked and heartless. There now, I like<br>your Denísov though he is a rake and all that, still I like him; so<br>you see I do understand. I don’t know how to put it... with this one<br>everything is calculated, and I don’t like that. But Denísov...”<br><br>“Oh, Denísov is quite different,” replied Nicholas, implying that<br>even Denísov was nothing compared to Dólokhov—“you must understand<br>what a soul there is in Dólokhov, you should see him with his mother.<br>What a heart!”<br><br>“Well, I don’t know about that, but I am uncomfortable with him. And<br>do you know he has fallen in love with Sónya?”<br><br>“What nonsense...”<br><br>“I’m certain of it; you’ll see.”<br><br>Natásha’s prediction proved true. Dólokhov, who did not usually care<br>for the society of ladies, began to come often to the house, and the<br>question for whose sake he came (though no one spoke of it) was soon<br>settled. He came because of Sónya. And Sónya, though she would never<br>have dared to say so, knew it and blushed scarlet every time Dólokhov<br>appeared.<br><br>Dólokhov often dined at the Rostóvs’, never missed a performance at<br>which they were present, and went to Iogel’s balls for young people<br>which the Rostóvs always attended. He was pointedly attentive to Sónya<br>and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his<br>glances without coloring, but even the old countess and Natásha blushed<br>when they saw his looks.<br><br>It was evident that this strange, strong man was under the irresistible<br>influence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.<br><br>Rostóv noticed something new in Dólokhov’s relations with Sónya,<br>but he did not explain to himself what these new relations were.<br>“They’re always in love with someone,” he thought of Sónya and<br>Natásha. But he was not as much at ease with Sónya and Dólokhov as<br>before and was less frequently at home.<br><br>In the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with<br>Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before. Orders were<br>given to raise recruits, ten men in every thousand for the regular army,<br>and besides this, nine men in every thousand for the militia. Everywhere<br>Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow nothing but the coming war<br>was talked of. For the Rostóv family the whole interest of these<br>preparations for war lay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of<br>remaining in Moscow, and only awaited the termination of Denísov’s<br>furlough after Christmas to return with him to their regiment. His<br>approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself, but rather<br>gave zest to his pleasures. He spent the greater part of his time away<br>from home, at dinners, parties, and balls.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>On the third day after Christmas Nicholas dined at home, a thing he had<br>rarely done of late. It was a grand farewell dinner, as he and Denísov<br>were leaving to join their regiment after Epiphany. About twenty people<br>were present, including Dólokhov and Denísov.<br><br>Never had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous<br>atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the Rostóvs’ house as at<br>this holiday time. “Seize the moments of happiness, love and be loved!<br>That is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one<br>thing we are interested in here,” said the spirit of the place.<br><br>Nicholas, having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses, without<br>visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited,<br>returned home just before dinner. As soon as he entered he noticed and<br>felt the tension of the amorous air in the house, and also noticed a<br>curious embarrassment among some of those present. Sónya, Dólokhov,<br>and the old countess were especially disturbed, and to a lesser degree<br>Natásha. Nicholas understood that something must have happened between<br>Sónya and Dólokhov before dinner, and with the kindly sensitiveness<br>natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner. On<br>that same evening there was to be one of the balls that Iogel (the<br>dancing master) gave for his pupils during the holidays.<br><br>“Nicholas, will you come to Iogel’s? Please do!” said Natásha.<br>“He asked you, and Vasíli Dmítrich * is also going.”<br><br>    * Denísov.<br><br>“Where would I not go at the countess’ command!” said Denísov,<br>who at the Rostóvs’ had jocularly assumed the role of Natásha’s<br>knight. “I’m even weady to dance the pas de châle.”<br><br>“If I have time,” answered Nicholas. “But I promised the<br>Arkhárovs; they have a party.”<br><br>“And you?” he asked Dólokhov, but as soon as he had asked the<br>question he noticed that it should not have been put.<br><br>“Perhaps,” coldly and angrily replied Dólokhov, glancing at Sónya,<br>and, scowling, he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given Pierre<br>at the club dinner.<br><br>“There is something up,” thought Nicholas, and he was further<br>confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that Dólokhov left immediately<br>after dinner. He called Natásha and asked her what was the matter.<br><br>“And I was looking for you,” said Natásha running out to him. “I<br>told you, but you would not believe it,” she said triumphantly. “He<br>has proposed to Sónya!”<br><br>Little as Nicholas had occupied himself with Sónya of late, something<br>seemed to give way within him at this news. Dólokhov was a suitable and<br>in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless, orphan girl. From<br>the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the<br>question for her to refuse him. And therefore Nicholas’ first feeling<br>on hearing the news was one of anger with Sónya.... He tried to say,<br>“That’s capital; of course she’ll forget her childish promises<br>and accept the offer,” but before he had time to say it Natásha began<br>again.<br><br>“And fancy! she refused him quite definitely!” adding, after a<br>pause, “she told him she loved another.”<br><br>“Yes, my Sónya could not have done otherwise!” thought Nicholas.<br><br>“Much as Mamma pressed her, she refused, and I know she won’t change<br>once she has said...”<br><br>“And Mamma pressed her!” said Nicholas reproachfully.<br><br>“Yes,” said Natásha. “Do you know, Nicholas—don’t be<br>angry—but I know you will not marry her. I know, heaven knows how, but<br>I know for certain that you won’t marry her.”<br><br>“Now you don’t know that at all!” said Nicholas. “But I must<br>talk to her. What a darling Sónya is!” he added with a smile.<br><br>“Ah, she is indeed a darling! I’ll send her to you.”<br><br>And Natásha kissed her brother and ran away.<br><br>A minute later Sónya came in with a frightened, guilty, and scared<br>look. Nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand. This was the first<br>time since his return that they had talked alone and about their love.<br><br>“Sophie,” he began, timidly at first and then more and more<br>boldly, “if you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and<br>advantageous match but a splendid, noble fellow... he is my friend...”<br><br>Sónya interrupted him.<br><br>“I have already refused,” she said hurriedly.<br><br>“If you are refusing for my sake, I am afraid that I...”<br><br>Sónya again interrupted. She gave him an imploring, frightened look.<br><br>“Nicholas, don’t tell me that!” she said.<br><br>“No, but I must. It may be arrogant of me, but still it is best to say<br>it. If you refuse him on my account, I must tell you the whole truth. I<br>love you, and I think I love you more than anyone else....”<br><br>“That is enough for me,” said Sónya, blushing.<br><br>“No, but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in<br>love again, though for no one have I such a feeling of friendship,<br>confidence, and love as I have for you. Then I am young. Mamma does<br>not wish it. In a word, I make no promise. And I beg you to consider<br>Dólokhov’s offer,” he said, articulating his friend’s name with<br>difficulty.<br><br>“Don’t say that to me! I want nothing. I love you as a brother and<br>always shall, and I want nothing more.”<br><br>“You are an angel: I am not worthy of you, but I am afraid of<br>misleading you.”<br><br>And Nicholas again kissed her hand.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>Iogel’s were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow. So said the mothers<br>as they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps,<br>and so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they<br>were ready to drop, and so said the grown-up young men and women who<br>came to these balls with an air of condescension and found them most<br>enjoyable. That year two marriages had come of these balls. The two<br>pretty young Princesses Gorchakóv met suitors there and were married<br>and so further increased the fame of these dances. What distinguished<br>them from others was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of<br>the good-natured Iogel, flying about like a feather and bowing according<br>to the rules of his art, as he collected the tickets from all his<br>visitors. There was the fact that only those came who wished to dance<br>and amuse themselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are<br>wearing long dresses for the first time. With scarcely any exceptions<br>they all were, or seemed to be, pretty—so rapturous were their smiles<br>and so sparkling their eyes. Sometimes the best of the pupils, of whom<br>Natásha, who was exceptionally graceful, was first, even danced the pas<br>de châle, but at this last ball only the écossaise, the anglaise, and<br>the mazurka, which was just coming into fashion, were danced. Iogel had<br>taken a ballroom in Bezúkhov’s house, and the ball, as everyone said,<br>was a great success. There were many pretty girls and the Rostóv girls<br>were among the prettiest. They were both particularly happy and gay.<br>That evening, proud of Dólokhov’s proposal, her refusal, and her<br>explanation with Nicholas, Sónya twirled about before she left home<br>so that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited, and she was<br>transparently radiant with impulsive joy.<br><br>Natásha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real<br>ball was even happier. They were both dressed in white muslin with pink<br>ribbons.<br><br>Natásha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom. She<br>was not in love with anyone in particular, but with everyone. Whatever<br>person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment.<br><br>“Oh, how delightful it is!” she kept saying, running up to Sónya.<br><br>Nicholas and Denísov were walking up and down, looking with kindly<br>patronage at the dancers.<br><br>“How sweet she is—she will be a weal beauty!” said Denísov.<br><br>“Who?”<br><br>“Countess Natásha,” answered Denísov.<br><br>“And how she dances! What gwace!” he said again after a pause.<br><br>“Who are you talking about?”<br><br>“About your sister,” ejaculated Denísov testily.<br><br>Rostóv smiled.<br><br>“My dear count, you were one of my best pupils—you must dance,”<br>said little Iogel coming up to Nicholas. “Look how many charming young<br>ladies—” He turned with the same request to Denísov who was also a<br>former pupil of his.<br><br>“No, my dear fellow, I’ll be a wallflower,” said Denísov.<br>“Don’t you wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons?”<br><br>“Oh no!” said Iogel, hastening to reassure him. “You were only<br>inattentive, but you had talent—oh yes, you had talent!”<br><br>The band struck up the newly introduced mazurka. Nicholas could not<br>refuse Iogel and asked Sónya to dance. Denísov sat down by the old<br>ladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot, told<br>them something funny and kept them amused, while he watched the young<br>people dancing, Iogel with Natásha, his pride and his best pupil, were<br>the first couple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with his little<br>feet in low shoes, Iogel flew first across the hall with Natásha, who,<br>though shy, went on carefully executing her steps. Denísov did not<br>take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly<br>indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not<br>because he could not. In the middle of a figure he beckoned to Rostóv<br>who was passing:<br><br>“This is not at all the thing,” he said. “What sort of Polish<br>mazuwka is this? But she does dance splendidly.”<br><br>Knowing that Denísov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly<br>way in which he danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to Natásha:<br><br>“Go and choose Denísov. He is a real dancer, a wonder!” he said.<br><br>When it came to Natásha’s turn to choose a partner, she rose and,<br>tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran<br>timidly to the corner where Denísov sat. She saw that everybody was<br>looking at her and waiting. Nicholas saw that Denísov was refusing<br>though he smiled delightedly. He ran up to them.<br><br>“Please, Vasíli Dmítrich,” Natásha was saying, “do come!”<br><br>“Oh no, let me off, Countess,” Denísov replied.<br><br>“Now then, Váska,” said Nicholas.<br><br>“They coax me as if I were Váska the cat!” said Denísov jokingly.<br><br>“I’ll sing for you a whole evening,” said Natásha.<br><br>“Oh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!” said Denísov, and<br>he unhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his<br>partner’s hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot,<br>waiting for the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was<br>Denísov’s short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow<br>he felt himself to be. At the right beat of the music he looked sideways<br>at his partner with a merry and triumphant air, suddenly stamped with<br>one foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew round the room<br>taking his partner with him. He glided silently on one foot half across<br>the room, and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at<br>them, when suddenly, clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs,<br>he stopped short on his heels, stood so a second, stamped on the spot<br>clanking his spurs, whirled rapidly round, and, striking his left heel<br>against his right, flew round again in a circle. Natásha guessed what<br>he meant to do, and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly<br>knowing how. First he spun her round, holding her now with his left, now<br>with his right hand, then falling on one knee he twirled her round him,<br>and again jumping up, dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if<br>he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath,<br>and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected<br>steps. When at last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her<br>chair, he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, Natásha<br>did not even make him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement,<br>smiling as if she did not recognize him.<br><br>“What does this mean?” she brought out.<br><br>Although Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka, everyone<br>was delighted with Denísov’s skill, he was asked again and again as<br>a partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the<br>good old days. Denísov, flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself<br>with his handkerchief, sat down by Natásha and did not leave her for<br>the rest of the evening.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>For two days after that Rostóv did not see Dólokhov at his own or at<br>Dólokhov’s home: on the third day he received a note from him:<br><br>As I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know<br>of, and am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell supper<br>tonight to my friends—come to the English Hotel.<br><br>About ten o’clock Rostóv went to the English Hotel straight from the<br>theater, where he had been with his family and Denísov. He was at once<br>shown to the best room, which Dólokhov had taken for that evening. Some<br>twenty men were gathered round a table at which Dólokhov sat between<br>two candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper money, and he<br>was keeping the bank. Rostóv had not seen him since his proposal and<br>Sónya’s refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they<br>would meet.<br><br>Dólokhov’s clear, cold glance met Rostóv as soon as he entered the<br>door, as though he had long expected him.<br><br>“It’s a long time since we met,” he said. “Thanks for coming.<br>I’ll just finish dealing, and then Ilyúshka will come with his<br>chorus.”<br><br>“I called once or twice at your house,” said Rostóv, reddening.<br><br>Dólokhov made no reply.<br><br>“You may punt,” he said.<br><br>Rostóv recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had<br>with Dólokhov. “None but fools trust to luck in play,” Dólokhov<br>had then said.<br><br>“Or are you afraid to play with me?” Dólokhov now asked as if<br>guessing Rostóv’s thought.<br><br>Beneath his smile Rostóv saw in him the mood he had shown at the club<br>dinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday life he had felt<br>a need to escape from it by some strange, and usually cruel, action.<br><br>Rostóv felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke with<br>which to reply to Dólokhov’s words. But before he had thought of<br>anything, Dólokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and<br>deliberately so that everyone could hear:<br><br>“Do you remember we had a talk about cards... ‘He’s a fool who<br>trusts to luck, one should make certain,’ and I want to try.”<br><br>“To try his luck or the certainty?” Rostóv asked himself.<br><br>“Well, you’d better not play,” Dólokhov added, and springing a<br>new pack of cards said: “Bank, gentlemen!”<br><br>Moving the money forward he prepared to deal. Rostóv sat down by his<br>side and at first did not play. Dólokhov kept glancing at him.<br><br>“Why don’t you play?” he asked.<br><br>And strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a<br>card, putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.<br><br>“I have no money with me,” he said.<br><br>“I’ll trust you.”<br><br>Rostóv staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, and again<br>lost. Dólokhov “killed,” that is, beat, ten cards of Rostóv’s<br>running.<br><br>“Gentlemen,” said Dólokhov after he had dealt for some time.<br>“Please place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the<br>reckoning.”<br><br>One of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.<br><br>“Yes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I<br>ask you to put the money on your cards,” replied Dólokhov. “Don’t<br>stint yourself, we’ll settle afterwards,” he added, turning to<br>Rostóv.<br><br>The game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.<br><br>All Rostóv’s cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored<br>up against him. He wrote “800 rubles” on a card, but while the<br>waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual<br>stake of twenty rubles.<br><br>“Leave it,” said Dólokhov, though he did not seem to be even<br>looking at Rostóv, “you’ll win it back all the sooner. I lose to<br>the others but win from you. Or are you afraid of me?” he asked again.<br><br>Rostóv submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven<br>of hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the floor. He<br>well remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts,<br>on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written “800 rubles” in<br>clear upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was<br>handed him, smiled at Dólokhov’s words, and with a sinking heart,<br>waiting for a seven to turn up, gazed at Dólokhov’s hands which held<br>the pack. Much depended on Rostóv’s winning or losing on that seven<br>of hearts. On the previous Sunday the old count had given his son<br>two thousand rubles, and though he always disliked speaking of money<br>difficulties had told Nicholas that this was all he could let him have<br>till May, and asked him to be more economical this time. Nicholas had<br>replied that it would be more than enough for him and that he gave his<br>word of honor not to take anything more till the spring. Now only twelve<br>hundred rubles was left of that money, so that this seven of hearts<br>meant for him not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the<br>necessity of going back on his word. With a sinking heart he watched<br>Dólokhov’s hands and thought, “Now then, make haste and let me have<br>this card and I’ll take my cap and drive home to supper with Denísov,<br>Natásha, and Sónya, and will certainly never touch a card again.” At<br>that moment his home life, jokes with Pétya, talks with Sónya, duets<br>with Natásha, piquet with his father, and even his comfortable bed<br>in the house on the Povarskáya rose before him with such vividness,<br>clearness, and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and<br>unappreciated bliss, long past. He could not conceive that a stupid<br>chance, letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left,<br>might deprive him of all this happiness, newly appreciated and newly<br>illumined, and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined<br>misery. That could not be, yet he awaited with a sinking heart the<br>movement of Dólokhov’s hands. Those broad, reddish hands, with hairy<br>wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs, laid down the pack and took<br>up a glass and a pipe that were handed him.<br><br>“So you are not afraid to play with me?” repeated Dólokhov, and as<br>if about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in his<br>chair, and began deliberately with a smile:<br><br>“Yes, gentlemen, I’ve been told there’s a rumor going about Moscow<br>that I’m a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.”<br><br>“Come now, deal!” exclaimed Rostóv.<br><br>“Oh, those Moscow gossips!” said Dólokhov, and he took up the cards<br>with a smile.<br><br>“Aah!” Rostóv almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The<br>seven he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He had<br>lost more than he could pay.<br><br>“Still, don’t ruin yourself!” said Dólokhov with a side glance at<br>Rostóv as he continued to deal.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>An hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested<br>in their own play.<br><br>The whole interest was concentrated on Rostóv. Instead of sixteen<br>hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him,<br>which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely<br>supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it already<br>exceeded twenty thousand rubles. Dólokhov was no longer listening to<br>stories or telling them, but followed every movement of Rostóv’s<br>hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him. He had<br>decided to play until that score reached forty-three thousand. He<br>had fixed on that number because forty-three was the sum of his and<br>Sónya’s joint ages. Rostóv, leaning his head on both hands, sat at<br>the table which was scrawled over with figures, wet with spilled wine,<br>and littered with cards. One tormenting impression did not leave him:<br>that those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from<br>under the shirt sleeves, those hands which he loved and hated, held him<br>in their power.<br><br>“Six hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it back’s<br>impossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The knave, double or<br>quits... it can’t be!... And why is he doing this to me?” Rostóv<br>pondered. Sometimes he staked a large sum, but Dólokhov refused to<br>accept it and fixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him, and at<br>one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge<br>over the Enns, and then guessed that the card that came first to hand<br>from the crumpled heap under the table would save him, now counted the<br>cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the<br>total of his losses on it, then he looked round for aid from the other<br>players, or peered at the now cold face of Dólokhov and tried to read<br>what was passing in his mind.<br><br>“He knows of course what this loss means to me. He can’t want my<br>ruin. Wasn’t he my friend? Wasn’t I fond of him? But it’s not his<br>fault. What’s he to do if he has such luck?... And it’s not my fault<br>either,” he thought to himself, “I have done nothing wrong. Have I<br>killed anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible<br>misfortune? And when did it begin? Such a little while ago I came to<br>this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that<br>casket for Mamma’s name day and then going home. I was so happy, so<br>free, so lighthearted! And I did not realize how happy I was! When did<br>that end and when did this new, terrible state of things begin? What<br>marked the change? I sat all the time in this same place at this table,<br>chose and placed cards, and watched those broad-boned agile hands in the<br>same way. When did it happen and what has happened? I am well and strong<br>and still the same and in the same place. No, it can’t be! Surely it<br>will all end in nothing!”<br><br>He was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not hot.<br>His face was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its helpless<br>efforts to seem calm.<br><br>The score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three thousand.<br>Rostóv had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he<br>meant to double the three thousand just put down to his score, when<br>Dólokhov, slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began<br>rapidly adding up the total of Rostóv’s debt, breaking the chalk as<br>he marked the figures in his clear, bold hand.<br><br>“Supper, it’s time for supper! And here are the gypsies!”<br><br>Some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside<br>and saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas understood that it<br>was all over; but he said in an indifferent tone:<br><br>“Well, won’t you go on? I had a splendid card all ready,” as if it<br>were the fun of the game which interested him most.<br><br>“It’s all up! I’m lost!” thought he. “Now a bullet through my<br>brain—that’s all that’s left me!” And at the same time he said<br>in a cheerful voice:<br><br>“Come now, just this one more little card!”<br><br>“All right!” said Dólokhov, having finished the addition. “All<br>right! Twenty-one rubles,” he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one<br>by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and<br>taking up a pack he prepared to deal. Rostóv submissively unbent the<br>corner of his card and, instead of the six thousand he had intended,<br>carefully wrote twenty-one.<br><br>“It’s all the same to me,” he said. “I only want to see whether<br>you will let me win this ten, or beat it.”<br><br>Dólokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how Rostóv detested at that<br>moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists,<br>which held him in their power.... The ten fell to him.<br><br>“You owe forty-three thousand, Count,” said Dólokhov, and<br>stretching himself he rose from the table. “One does get tired sitting<br>so long,” he added.<br><br>“Yes, I’m tired too,” said Rostóv.<br><br>Dólokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not for him to<br>jest.<br><br>“When am I to receive the money, Count?”<br><br>Rostóv, flushing, drew Dólokhov into the next room.<br><br>“I cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?” he said.<br><br>“I say, Rostóv,” said Dólokhov clearly, smiling and looking<br>Nicholas straight in the eyes, “you know the saying, ‘Lucky in love,<br>unlucky at cards.’ Your cousin is in love with you, I know.”<br><br>“Oh, it’s terrible to feel oneself so in this man’s power,”<br>thought Rostóv. He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and<br>mother by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be to<br>escape it all, and felt that Dólokhov knew that he could save him from<br>all this shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a cat does<br>with a mouse.<br><br>“Your cousin...” Dólokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted<br>him.<br><br>“My cousin has nothing to do with this and it’s not necessary to<br>mention her!” he exclaimed fiercely.<br><br>“Then when am I to have it?”<br><br>“Tomorrow,” replied Rostóv and left the room.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>To say “tomorrow” and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult,<br>but to go home alone, see his sisters, brother, mother, and father,<br>confess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of<br>honor, was terrible.<br><br>At home, they had not yet gone to bed. The young people, after returning<br>from the theater, had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord.<br>As soon as Nicholas entered, he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere<br>of love which pervaded the Rostóv household that winter and, now after<br>Dólokhov’s proposal and Iogel’s ball, seemed to have grown thicker<br>round Sónya and Natásha as the air does before a thunderstorm. Sónya<br>and Natásha, in the light-blue dresses they had worn at the theater,<br>looking pretty and conscious of it, were standing by the clavichord,<br>happy and smiling. Véra was playing chess with Shinshín in the drawing<br>room. The old countess, waiting for the return of her husband and son,<br>sat playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house.<br>Denísov, with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord<br>striking chords with his short fingers, his legs thrown back and his<br>eyes rolling as he sang, with his small, husky, but true voice, some<br>verses called “Enchantress,” which he had composed, and to which he<br>was trying to fit music:<br><br>   Enchantress, say, to my forsaken lyre<br>   What magic power is this recalls me still?<br>   What spark has set my inmost soul on fire,<br>   What is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill?<br><br>He was singing in passionate tones, gazing with his sparkling<br>black-agate eyes at the frightened and happy Natásha.<br><br>“Splendid! Excellent!” exclaimed Natásha. “Another verse,” she<br>said, without noticing Nicholas.<br><br>“Everything’s still the same with them,” thought Nicholas,<br>glancing into the drawing room, where he saw Véra and his mother with<br>the old lady.<br><br>“Ah, and here’s Nicholas!” cried Natásha, running up to him.<br><br>“Is Papa at home?” he asked.<br><br>“I am so glad you’ve come!” said Natásha, without answering him.<br>“We are enjoying ourselves! Vasíli Dmítrich is staying a day longer<br>for my sake! Did you know?”<br><br>“No, Papa is not back yet,” said Sónya.<br><br>“Nicholas, have you come? Come here, dear!” called the old countess<br>from the drawing room.<br><br>Nicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down silently at her<br>table began to watch her hands arranging the cards. From the dancing<br>room, they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade<br>Natásha to sing.<br><br>“All wight! All wight!” shouted Denísov. “It’s no good making<br>excuses now! It’s your turn to sing the ba’cawolla—I entweat<br>you!”<br><br>The countess glanced at her silent son.<br><br>“What is the matter?” she asked.<br><br>“Oh, nothing,” said he, as if weary of being continually asked the<br>same question. “Will Papa be back soon?”<br><br>“I expect so.”<br><br>“Everything’s the same with them. They know nothing about it! Where<br>am I to go?” thought Nicholas, and went again into the dancing room<br>where the clavichord stood.<br><br>Sónya was sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to<br>Denísov’s favorite barcarolle. Natásha was preparing to sing.<br>Denísov was looking at her with enraptured eyes.<br><br>Nicholas began pacing up and down the room.<br><br>“Why do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? There’s<br>nothing to be happy about!” thought he.<br><br>Sónya struck the first chord of the prelude.<br><br>“My God, I’m a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet through my brain<br>is the only thing left me—not singing!” his thoughts ran on. “Go<br>away? But where to? It’s one—let them sing!”<br><br>He continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at Denísov and the<br>girls and avoiding their eyes.<br><br>“Nikólenka, what is the matter?” Sónya’s eyes fixed on him<br>seemed to ask. She noticed at once that something had happened to him.<br><br>Nicholas turned away from her. Natásha too, with her quick instinct,<br>had instantly noticed her brother’s condition. But, though she noticed<br>it, she was herself in such high spirits at that moment, so far from<br>sorrow, sadness, or self-reproach, that she purposely deceived herself<br>as young people often do. “No, I am too happy now to spoil my<br>enjoyment by sympathy with anyone’s sorrow,” she felt, and she said<br>to herself: “No, I must be mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as<br>I am.”<br><br>“Now, Sónya!” she said, going to the very middle of the room, where<br>she considered the resonance was best.<br><br>Having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly, as ballet<br>dancers do, Natásha, rising energetically from her heels to her toes,<br>stepped to the middle of the room and stood still.<br><br>“Yes, that’s me!” she seemed to say, answering the rapt gaze with<br>which Denísov followed her.<br><br>“And what is she so pleased about?” thought Nicholas, looking at his<br>sister. “Why isn’t she dull and ashamed?”<br><br>Natásha took the first note, her throat swelled, her chest rose,<br>her eyes became serious. At that moment she was oblivious of her<br>surroundings, and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may<br>produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time, but which<br>leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill<br>you and make you weep.<br><br>Natásha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing seriously,<br>mainly because Denísov so delighted in her singing. She no longer sang<br>as a child, there was no longer in her singing that comical, childish,<br>painstaking effect that had been in it before; but she did not yet sing<br>well, as all the connoisseurs who heard her said: “It is not trained,<br>but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained.” Only they generally<br>said this some time after she had finished singing. While that untrained<br>voice, with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions, was<br>sounding, even the connoisseurs said nothing, but only delighted in<br>it and wished to hear it again. In her voice there was a virginal<br>freshness, an unconsciousness of her own powers, and an as yet untrained<br>velvety softness, which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that<br>it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling<br>it.<br><br>“What is this?” thought Nicholas, listening to her with widely<br>opened eyes. “What has happened to her? How she is singing today!”<br>And suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the<br>next note, the next phrase, and everything in the world was divided into<br>three beats: “Oh mio crudele affetto.”... One, two, three... one,<br>two, three... One... “Oh mio crudele affetto.”... One, two, three...<br>One. “Oh, this senseless life of ours!” thought Nicholas. “All<br>this misery, and money, and Dólokhov, and anger, and honor—it’s all<br>nonsense... but this is real.... Now then, Natásha, now then, dearest!<br>Now then, darling! How will she take that si? She’s taken it! Thank<br>God!” And without noticing that he was singing, to strengthen the si<br>he sung a second, a third below the high note. “Ah, God! How fine! Did<br>I really take it? How fortunate!” he thought.<br><br>Oh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was finest<br>in Rostóv’s soul! And this something was apart from everything else<br>in the world and above everything in the world. “What were losses, and<br>Dólokhov, and words of honor?... All nonsense! One might kill and rob<br>and yet be happy....”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>It was long since Rostóv had felt such enjoyment from music as he<br>did that day. But no sooner had Natásha finished her barcarolle than<br>reality again presented itself. He got up without saying a word and went<br>downstairs to his own room. A quarter of an hour later the old count<br>came in from his club, cheerful and contented. Nicholas, hearing him<br>drive up, went to meet him.<br><br>“Well—had a good time?” said the old count, smiling gaily and<br>proudly at his son.<br><br>Nicholas tried to say “Yes,” but could not: and he nearly burst into<br>sobs. The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son’s<br>condition.<br><br>“Ah, it can’t be avoided!” thought Nicholas, for the first and<br>last time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him feel<br>ashamed of himself, he said, as if merely asking his father to let him<br>have the carriage to drive to town:<br><br>“Papa, I have come on a matter of business. I was nearly forgetting. I<br>need some money.”<br><br>“Dear me!” said his father, who was in a specially good humor. “I<br>told you it would not be enough. How much?”<br><br>“Very much,” said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless<br>smile, for which he was long unable to forgive himself, “I have lost a<br>little, I mean a good deal, a great deal—forty three thousand.”<br><br>“What! To whom?... Nonsense!” cried the count, suddenly reddening<br>with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do.<br><br>“I promised to pay tomorrow,” said Nicholas.<br><br>“Well!...” said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking<br>helplessly on the sofa.<br><br>“It can’t be helped! It happens to everyone!” said the son, with<br>a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a<br>worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He<br>longed to kiss his father’s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness,<br>but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to<br>everyone!<br><br>The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son’s words and began<br>bustlingly searching for something.<br><br>“Yes, yes,” he muttered, “it will be difficult, I fear, difficult<br>to raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?”<br><br>And with a furtive glance at his son’s face, the count went out of the<br>room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all<br>expected this.<br><br>“Papa! Pa-pa!” he called after him, sobbing, “forgive me!” And<br>seizing his father’s hand, he pressed it to his lips and burst into<br>tears.<br><br>While father and son were having their explanation, the mother and<br>daughter were having one not less important. Natásha came running to<br>her mother, quite excited.<br><br>“Mamma!... Mamma!... He has made me...”<br><br>“Made what?”<br><br>“Made, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!” she exclaimed.<br><br>The countess did not believe her ears. Denísov had proposed. To whom?<br>To this chit of a girl, Natásha, who not so long ago was playing with<br>dolls and who was still having lessons.<br><br>“Don’t, Natásha! What nonsense!” she said, hoping it was a joke.<br><br>“Nonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact,” said Natásha<br>indignantly. “I come to ask you what to do, and you call it<br>‘nonsense!’”<br><br>The countess shrugged her shoulders.<br><br>“If it is true that Monsieur Denísov has made you a proposal, tell<br>him he is a fool, that’s all!”<br><br>“No, he’s not a fool!” replied Natásha indignantly and seriously.<br><br>“Well then, what do you want? You’re all in love nowadays. Well,<br>if you are in love, marry him!” said the countess, with a laugh of<br>annoyance. “Good luck to you!”<br><br>“No, Mamma, I’m not in love with him, I suppose I’m not in love<br>with him.”<br><br>“Well then, tell him so.”<br><br>“Mamma, are you cross? Don’t be cross, dear! Is it my fault?”<br><br>“No, but what is it, my dear? Do you want me to go and tell him?”<br>said the countess smiling.<br><br>“No, I will do it myself, only tell me what to say. It’s all very<br>well for you,” said Natásha, with a responsive smile. “You should<br>have seen how he said it! I know he did not mean to say it, but it came<br>out accidently.”<br><br>“Well, all the same, you must refuse him.”<br><br>“No, I mustn’t. I am so sorry for him! He’s so nice.”<br><br>“Well then, accept his offer. It’s high time for you to be<br>married,” answered the countess sharply and sarcastically.<br><br>“No, Mamma, but I’m so sorry for him. I don’t know how I’m to<br>say it.”<br><br>“And there’s nothing for you to say. I shall speak to him myself,”<br>said the countess, indignant that they should have dared to treat this<br>little Natásha as grown up.<br><br>“No, not on any account! I will tell him myself, and you’ll listen<br>at the door,” and Natásha ran across the drawing room to the dancing<br>hall, where Denísov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord<br>with his face in his hands.<br><br>He jumped up at the sound of her light step.<br><br>“Nataly,” he said, moving with rapid steps toward her, “decide my<br>fate. It is in your hands.”<br><br>“Vasíli Dmítrich, I’m so sorry for you!... No, but you are so<br>nice... but it won’t do...not that... but as a friend, I shall always<br>love you.”<br><br>Denísov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not<br>understand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At this instant, they<br>heard the quick rustle of the countess’ dress. She came up to them.<br><br>“Vasíli Dmítrich, I thank you for the honor,” she said, with an<br>embarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to Denísov—“but my<br>daughter is so young, and I thought that, as my son’s friend, you<br>would have addressed yourself first to me. In that case you would not<br>have obliged me to give this refusal.”<br><br>“Countess...” said Denísov, with downcast eyes and a guilty face.<br>He tried to say more, but faltered.<br><br>Natásha could not remain calm, seeing him in such a plight. She began<br>to sob aloud.<br><br>“Countess, I have done w’ong,” Denísov went on in an unsteady<br>voice, “but believe me, I so adore your daughter and all your family<br>that I would give my life twice over...” He looked at the countess,<br>and seeing her severe face said: “Well, good-by, Countess,” and<br>kissing her hand, he left the room with quick resolute strides, without<br>looking at Natásha.<br><br><br>Next day Rostóv saw Denísov off. He did not wish to stay another<br>day in Moscow. All Denísov’s Moscow friends gave him a farewell<br>entertainment at the gypsies’, with the result that he had no<br>recollection of how he was put in the sleigh or of the first three<br>stages of his journey.<br><br>After Denísov’s departure, Rostóv spent another fortnight in Moscow,<br>without going out of the house, waiting for the money his father could<br>not at once raise, and he spent most of his time in the girls’ room.<br><br>Sónya was more tender and devoted to him than ever. It was as if she<br>wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her<br>love him all the more, but Nicholas now considered himself unworthy of<br>her.<br><br>He filled the girls’ albums with verses and music, and having at last<br>sent Dólokhov the whole forty-three thousand rubles and received his<br>receipt, he left at the end of November, without taking leave of any of<br>his acquaintances, to overtake his regiment which was already in Poland.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK FIVE: 1806 - 07<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>After his interview with his wife Pierre left for Petersburg. At the<br>Torzhók post station, either there were no horses or the postmaster<br>would not supply them. Pierre was obliged to wait. Without undressing,<br>he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big<br>feet in their overboots on the table, and began to reflect.<br><br>“Will you have the portmanteaus brought in? And a bed got ready, and<br>tea?” asked his valet.<br><br>Pierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw anything. He had<br>begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same<br>question—one so important that he took no notice of what went<br>on around him. Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to<br>Petersburg earlier or later, or whether he secured accommodation at this<br>station, but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a<br>matter of indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for<br>the rest of his life.<br><br>The postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a peasant woman selling<br>Torzhók embroidery came into the room offering their services.<br>Without changing his careless attitude, Pierre looked at them over his<br>spectacles unable to understand what they wanted or how they could go on<br>living without having solved the problems that so absorbed him. He had<br>been engrossed by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from<br>Sokólniki after the duel and had spent that first agonizing, sleepless<br>night. But now, in the solitude of the journey, they seized him with<br>special force. No matter what he thought about, he always returned to<br>these same questions which he could not solve and yet could not cease to<br>ask himself. It was as if the thread of the chief screw which held his<br>life together were stripped, so that the screw could not get in or out,<br>but went on turning uselessly in the same place.<br><br>The postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to<br>wait only two hours, when, come what might, he would let his excellency<br>have the courier horses. It was plain that he was lying and only wanted<br>to get more money from the traveler.<br><br>“Is this good or bad?” Pierre asked himself. “It is good for me,<br>bad for another traveler, and for himself it’s unavoidable, because<br>he needs money for food; the man said an officer had once given him a<br>thrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horses.<br>But the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as<br>possible. And I,” continued Pierre, “shot Dólokhov because I<br>considered myself injured, and Louis XVI was executed because they<br>considered him a criminal, and a year later they executed those who<br>executed him—also for some reason. What is bad? What is good? What<br>should one love and what hate? What does one live for? And what am I?<br>What is life, and what is death? What power governs all?”<br><br>There was no answer to any of these questions, except one, and that<br>not a logical answer and not at all a reply to them. The answer was:<br>“You’ll die and all will end. You’ll die and know all, or cease<br>asking.” But dying was also dreadful.<br><br>The Torzhók peddler woman, in a whining voice, went on offering her<br>wares, especially a pair of goatskin slippers. “I have hundreds of<br>rubles I don’t know what to do with, and she stands in her tattered<br>cloak looking timidly at me,” he thought. “And what does she<br>want the money for? As if that money could add a hair’s breadth to<br>happiness or peace of mind. Can anything in the world make her or me<br>less a prey to evil and death?—death which ends all and must come<br>today or tomorrow—at any rate, in an instant as compared with<br>eternity.” And again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread,<br>and again it turned uselessly in the same place.<br><br>His servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters, by<br>Madame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous<br>struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. “And why did she resist<br>her seducer when she loved him?” he thought. “God could not have put<br>into her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wife—as she<br>once was—did not struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has been<br>found out, nothing discovered,” Pierre again said to himself. “All<br>we can know is that we know nothing. And that’s the height of human<br>wisdom.”<br><br>Everything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and<br>repellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre<br>found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction.<br><br>“I make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this<br>gentleman,” said the postmaster, entering the room followed by another<br>traveler, also detained for lack of horses.<br><br>The newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old<br>man, with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite<br>grayish color.<br><br>Pierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a bed that<br>had been got ready for him, glancing now and then at the newcomer, who,<br>with a gloomy and tired face, was wearily taking off his wraps with the<br>aid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With a pair of felt boots<br>on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn, nankeen-covered, sheepskin<br>coat, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaned back his big head with<br>its broad temples and close-cropped hair, and looked at Bezúkhov. The<br>stern, shrewd, and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre. He<br>felt a wish to speak to the stranger, but by the time he had made up his<br>mind to ask him a question about the roads, the traveler had closed his<br>eyes. His shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of<br>them Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a<br>death’s head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as<br>it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant<br>was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache,<br>evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown.<br>This active old servant was unpacking the traveler’s canteen and<br>preparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything was<br>ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled a<br>tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom<br>he passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the<br>need, even the inevitability, of entering into conversation with this<br>stranger.<br><br>The servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down, * with an<br>unfinished bit of nibbled sugar, and asked if anything more would be<br>wanted.<br><br>    * To indicate he did not want more tea.<br><br>“No. Give me the book,” said the stranger.<br><br>The servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional work,<br>and the traveler became absorbed in it. Pierre looked at him. All at<br>once the stranger closed the book, putting in a marker, and again,<br>leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa, sat in his former<br>position with his eyes shut. Pierre looked at him and had not time<br>to turn away when the old man, opening his eyes, fixed his steady and<br>severe gaze straight on Pierre’s face.<br><br>Pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, but the bright old<br>eyes attracted him irresistibly.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>“I have the pleasure of addressing Count Bezúkhov, if I am not<br>mistaken,” said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice.<br><br>Pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles.<br><br>“I have heard of you, my dear sir,” continued the stranger, “and<br>of your misfortune.” He seemed to emphasize the last word, as if to<br>say—“Yes, misfortune! Call it what you please, I know that what<br>happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.”—“I regret it very<br>much, my dear sir.”<br><br>Pierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed, bent<br>forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.<br><br>“I have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, but for<br>greater reasons.”<br><br>He paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the sofa by way<br>of inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt reluctant<br>to enter into conversation with this old man, but, submitting to him<br>involuntarily, came up and sat down beside him.<br><br>“You are unhappy, my dear sir,” the stranger continued. “You<br>are young and I am old. I should like to help you as far as lies in my<br>power.”<br><br>“Oh, yes!” said Pierre, with a forced smile. “I am very grateful<br>to you. Where are you traveling from?”<br><br>The stranger’s face was not genial, it was even cold and severe, but<br>in spite of this, both the face and words of his new acquaintance were<br>irresistibly attractive to Pierre.<br><br>“But if for any reason you don’t feel inclined to talk to me,”<br>said the old man, “say so, my dear sir.” And he suddenly smiled, in<br>an unexpected and tenderly paternal way.<br><br>“Oh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to make your<br>acquaintance,” said Pierre. And again, glancing at the stranger’s<br>hands, he looked more closely at the ring, with its skull—a Masonic<br>sign.<br><br>“Allow me to ask,” he said, “are you a Mason?”<br><br>“Yes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons,” said the<br>stranger, looking deeper and deeper into Pierre’s eyes. “And in<br>their name and my own I hold out a brotherly hand to you.”<br><br>“I am afraid,” said Pierre, smiling, and wavering between the<br>confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own<br>habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs—“I am afraid I am very far<br>from understanding—how am I to put it?—I am afraid my way of looking<br>at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one<br>another.”<br><br>“I know your outlook,” said the Mason, “and the view of life you<br>mention, and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts,<br>is the one held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit<br>of pride, indolence, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I<br>had not known it I should not have addressed you. Your view of life is a<br>regrettable delusion.”<br><br>“Just as I may suppose you to be deluded,” said Pierre, with a faint<br>smile.<br><br>“I should never dare to say that I know the truth,” said the Mason,<br>whose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision and firmness.<br>“No one can attain to truth by himself. Only by laying stone on stone<br>with the cooperation of all, by the millions of generations from our<br>forefather Adam to our own times, is that temple reared which is to be<br>a worthy dwelling place of the Great God,” he added, and closed his<br>eyes.<br><br>“I ought to tell you that I do not believe... do not believe in<br>God,” said Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, feeling it<br>essential to speak the whole truth.<br><br>The Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man with<br>millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he, poor<br>man, had not the five rubles that would make him happy.<br><br>“Yes, you do not know Him, my dear sir,” said the Mason. “You<br>cannot know Him. You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy.”<br><br>“Yes, yes, I am unhappy,” assented Pierre. “But what am I to<br>do?”<br><br>“You know Him not, my dear sir, and so you are very unhappy. You do<br>not know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He is in<br>thee, and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered!”<br>pronounced the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice.<br><br>He paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.<br><br>“If He were not,” he said quietly, “you and I would not be<br>speaking of Him, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom<br>hast thou denied?” he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and<br>authority in his voice. “Who invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence<br>came thy conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being?<br>didst thou, and why did the whole world, conceive the idea of the<br>existence of such an incomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful,<br>eternal, and infinite in all His attributes?...”<br><br>He stopped and remained silent for a long time.<br><br>Pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.<br><br>“He exists, but to understand Him is hard,” the Mason began again,<br>looking not at Pierre but straight before him, and turning the leaves<br>of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep<br>still. “If it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could<br>bring him to thee, could take him by the hand and show him to thee. But<br>how can I, an insignificant mortal, show His omnipotence, His infinity,<br>and all His mercy to one who is blind, or who shuts his eyes that he may<br>not see or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness<br>and sinfulness?” He paused again. “Who art thou? Thou dreamest that<br>thou art wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words,” he<br>went on, with a somber and scornful smile. “And thou art more foolish<br>and unreasonable than a little child, who, playing with the parts of a<br>skillfully made watch, dares to say that, as he does not understand<br>its use, he does not believe in the master who made it. To know Him is<br>hard.... For ages, from our forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to<br>attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim; but<br>in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and His<br>greatness....”<br><br>Pierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the Mason’s face with<br>shining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him, but believing with<br>his whole soul what the stranger said. Whether he accepted the wise<br>reasoning contained in the Mason’s words, or believed as a child<br>believes, in the speaker’s tone of conviction and earnestness, or<br>the tremor of the speaker’s voice—which sometimes almost broke—or<br>those brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction, or the calm<br>firmness and certainty of his vocation, which radiated from his whole<br>being (and which struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own<br>dejection and hopelessness)—at any rate, Pierre longed with his whole<br>soul to believe and he did believe, and felt a joyful sense of comfort,<br>regeneration, and return to life.<br><br>“He is not to be apprehended by reason, but by life,” said the<br>Mason.<br><br>“I do not understand,” said Pierre, feeling with dismay doubts<br>reawakening. He was afraid of any want of clearness, any weakness, in<br>the Mason’s arguments; he dreaded not to be able to believe in him.<br>“I don’t understand,” he said, “how it is that the mind of man<br>cannot attain the knowledge of which you speak.”<br><br>The Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.<br><br>“The highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish<br>to imbibe,” he said. “Can I receive that pure liquid into an impure<br>vessel and judge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of myself<br>can I retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive.”<br><br>“Yes, yes, that is so,” said Pierre joyfully.<br><br>“The highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, not on those<br>worldly sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and the like, into<br>which intellectual knowledge is divided. The highest wisdom is one.<br>The highest wisdom has but one science—the science of the whole—the<br>science explaining the whole creation and man’s place in it. To<br>receive that science it is necessary to purify and renew one’s inner<br>self, and so before one can know, it is necessary to believe and to<br>perfect one’s self. And to attain this end, we have the light called<br>conscience that God has implanted in our souls.”<br><br>“Yes, yes,” assented Pierre.<br><br>“Look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit, and ask<br>thyself whether thou art content with thyself. What hast thou attained<br>relying on reason only? What art thou? You are young, you are rich, you<br>are clever, you are well educated. And what have you done with all these<br>good gifts? Are you content with yourself and with your life?”<br><br>“No, I hate my life,” Pierre muttered, wincing.<br><br>“Thou hatest it. Then change it, purify thyself; and as thou art<br>purified, thou wilt gain wisdom. Look at your life, my dear sir.<br>How have you spent it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, receiving<br>everything from society and giving nothing in return. You have become<br>the possessor of wealth. How have you used it? What have you done<br>for your neighbor? Have you ever thought of your tens of thousands<br>of slaves? Have you helped them physically and morally? No! You have<br>profited by their toil to lead a profligate life. That is what you have<br>done. Have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your<br>neighbor? No! You have spent your life in idleness. Then you married, my<br>dear sir—took on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young<br>woman; and what have you done? You have not helped her to find the way<br>of truth, my dear sir, but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and<br>misery. A man offended you and you shot him, and you say you do not<br>know God and hate your life. There is nothing strange in that, my dear<br>sir!”<br><br>After these words, the Mason, as if tired by his long discourse, again<br>leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. Pierre<br>looked at that aged, stern, motionless, almost lifeless face and moved<br>his lips without uttering a sound. He wished to say, “Yes, a vile,<br>idle, vicious life!” but dared not break the silence.<br><br>The Mason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called his<br>servant.<br><br>“How about the horses?” he asked, without looking at Pierre.<br><br>“The exchange horses have just come,” answered the servant. “Will<br>you not rest here?”<br><br>“No, tell them to harness.”<br><br>“Can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me<br>all, and without promising to help me?” thought Pierre, rising with<br>downcast head; and he began to pace the room, glancing occasionally at<br>the Mason. “Yes, I never thought of it, but I have led a contemptible<br>and profligate life, though I did not like it and did not want to,”<br>thought Pierre. “But this man knows the truth and, if he wished to,<br>could disclose it to me.”<br><br>Pierre wished to say this to the Mason, but did not dare to. The<br>traveler, having packed his things with his practiced hands, began<br>fastening his coat. When he had finished, he turned to Bezúkhov, and<br>said in a tone of indifferent politeness:<br><br>“Where are you going to now, my dear sir?”<br><br>“I?... I’m going to Petersburg,” answered Pierre, in a childlike,<br>hesitating voice. “I thank you. I agree with all you have said. But<br>do not suppose me to be so bad. With my whole soul I wish to be what you<br>would have me be, but I have never had help from anyone.... But it is<br>I, above all, who am to blame for everything. Help me, teach me, and<br>perhaps I may...”<br><br>Pierre could not go on. He gulped and turned away.<br><br>The Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.<br><br>“Help comes from God alone,” he said, “but such measure of help as<br>our Order can bestow it will render you, my dear sir. You are going to<br>Petersburg. Hand this to Count Willarski” (he took out his notebook<br>and wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four).<br>“Allow me to give you a piece of advice. When you reach the capital,<br>first of all devote some time to solitude and self-examination and do<br>not resume your former way of life. And now I wish you a good journey,<br>my dear sir,” he added, seeing that his servant had entered... “and<br>success.”<br><br>The traveler was Joseph Alexéevich Bazdéev, as Pierre saw from the<br>postmaster’s book. Bazdéev had been one of the best-known Freemasons<br>and Martinists, even in Novíkov’s time. For a long while after he had<br>gone, Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down<br>the room, pondering over his vicious past, and with a rapturous sense<br>of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful, irreproachable,<br>virtuous future that seemed to him so easy. It seemed to him that he had<br>been vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to<br>be virtuous. Not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul. He<br>firmly believed in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in<br>the aim of supporting one another in the path of virtue, and that is how<br>Freemasonry presented itself to him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>On reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival,<br>he went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas à Kempis, whose<br>book had been sent him by someone unknown. One thing he continually<br>realized as he read that book: the joy, hitherto unknown to him,<br>of believing in the possibility of attaining perfection, and in the<br>possibility of active brotherly love among men, which Joseph Alexéevich<br>had revealed to him. A week after his arrival, the young Polish count,<br>Willarski, whom Pierre had known slightly in Petersburg society, came<br>into his room one evening in the official and ceremonious manner in<br>which Dólokhov’s second had called on him, and, having closed the<br>door behind him and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the<br>room, addressed Pierre.<br><br>“I have come to you with a message and an offer, Count,” he<br>said without sitting down. “A person of very high standing in our<br>Brotherhood has made application for you to be received into our Order<br>before the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor. I<br>consider it a sacred duty to fulfill that person’s wishes. Do you wish<br>to enter the Brotherhood of Freemasons under my sponsorship?”<br><br>The cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always before met<br>at balls, amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women,<br>surprised Pierre.<br><br>“Yes, I do wish it,” said he.<br><br>Willarski bowed his head.<br><br>“One more question, Count,” he said, “which I beg you to answer<br>in all sincerity—not as a future Mason but as an honest man: have you<br>renounced your former convictions—do you believe in God?”<br><br>Pierre considered.<br><br>“Yes... yes, I believe in God,” he said.<br><br>“In that case...” began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted him.<br><br>“Yes, I do believe in God,” he repeated.<br><br>“In that case we can go,” said Willarski. “My carriage is at your<br>service.”<br><br>Willarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierre’s inquiries as<br>to what he must do and how he should answer, Willarski only replied that<br>brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had only to<br>tell the truth.<br><br>Having entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had its<br>headquarters, and having ascended a dark staircase, they entered a small<br>well-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of<br>a servant. From there they passed into another room. A man in strange<br>attire appeared at the door. Willarski, stepping toward him, said<br>something to him in French in an undertone and then went up to a small<br>wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen<br>before. Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard, Willarski bound<br>Pierre’s eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind, catching some<br>hairs painfully in the knot. Then he drew his face down, kissed him, and<br>taking him by the hand led him forward. The hairs tied in the knot hurt<br>Pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile.<br>His huge figure, with arms hanging down and with a puckered, though<br>smiling face, moved after Willarski with uncertain, timid steps.<br><br>Having led him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.<br><br>“Whatever happens to you,” he said, “you must bear it all manfully<br>if you have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood.” (Pierre nodded<br>affirmatively.) “When you hear a knock at the door, you will uncover<br>your eyes,” added Willarski. “I wish you courage and success,”<br>and, pressing Pierre’s hand, he went out.<br><br>Left alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. Once or twice<br>he shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if<br>wishing to take it off, but let it drop again. The five minutes spent<br>with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour. His arms felt numb,<br>his legs almost gave way, it seemed to him that he was tired out. He<br>experienced a variety of most complex sensations. He felt afraid of what<br>would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear. He felt<br>curious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed to<br>him; but most of all, he felt joyful that the moment had come when he<br>would at last start on that path of regeneration and on the actively<br>virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met Joseph<br>Alexéevich. Loud knocks were heard at the door. Pierre took the bandage<br>off his eyes and glanced around him. The room was in black darkness,<br>only a small lamp was burning inside something white. Pierre went nearer<br>and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open book.<br>The book was the Gospel, and the white thing with the lamp inside was a<br>human skull with its cavities and teeth. After reading the first words<br>of the Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with<br>God,” Pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled<br>with something. It was a coffin with bones inside. He was not at all<br>surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite<br>unlike the old one, he expected everything to be unusual, even more<br>unusual than what he was seeing. A skull, a coffin, the Gospel—it<br>seemed to him that he had expected all this and even more. Trying<br>to stimulate his emotions he looked around. “God, death, love, the<br>brotherhood of man,” he kept saying to himself, associating these<br>words with vague yet joyful ideas. The door opened and someone came in.<br><br>By the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed, he<br>saw a rather short man. Having evidently come from the light into the<br>darkness, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps toward the<br>table and placed on it his small leather-gloved hands.<br><br>This short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and<br>part of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high<br>white ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit up from<br>below.<br><br>“For what have you come hither?” asked the newcomer, turning in<br>Pierre’s direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. “Why have<br>you, who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not<br>seen the light, come here? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue,<br>enlightenment?”<br><br>At the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre felt a<br>sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at<br>confession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete<br>stranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man. With bated<br>breath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor (by which name the<br>brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was<br>known). Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew,<br>Smolyanínov, and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an<br>acquaintance—he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor.<br>For a long time he could not utter a word, so that the Rhetor had to<br>repeat his question.<br><br>“Yes... I... I... desire regeneration,” Pierre uttered with<br>difficulty.<br><br>“Very well,” said Smolyanínov, and went on at once: “Have you any<br>idea of the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach your<br>aim?” said he quietly and quickly.<br><br>“I... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration,” said Pierre,<br>with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his<br>excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in<br>Russian.<br><br>“What is your conception of Freemasonry?”<br><br>“I imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who<br>have virtuous aims,” said Pierre, feeling ashamed of the inadequacy<br>of his words for the solemnity of the moment, as he spoke. “I<br>imagine...”<br><br>“Good!” said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with<br>this answer. “Have you sought for means of attaining your aim in<br>religion?”<br><br>“No, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it,” said Pierre,<br>so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was<br>saying. “I have been an atheist,” answered Pierre.<br><br>“You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life,<br>therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?” said the<br>Rhetor, after a moment’s pause.<br><br>“Yes, yes,” assented Pierre.<br><br>The Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his breast,<br>and began to speak.<br><br>“Now I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order,” he said,<br>“and if this aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood<br>with profit. The first and chief object of our Order, the foundation on<br>which it rests and which no human power can destroy, is the preservation<br>and handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery... which<br>has come down to us from the remotest ages, even from the first man—a<br>mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends. But since this<br>mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be<br>prepared by long and diligent self-purification, not everyone can hope<br>to attain it quickly. Hence we have a secondary aim, that of preparing<br>our members as much as possible to reform their hearts, to purify and<br>enlighten their minds, by means handed on to us by tradition from those<br>who have striven to attain this mystery, and thereby to render them<br>capable of receiving it.<br><br>“By purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, to improve<br>the whole human race, offering it in our members an example of piety<br>and virtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which<br>sways the world. Think this over and I will come to you again.”<br><br>“To combat the evil which sways the world...” Pierre repeated, and a<br>mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind.<br>He imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago, and he<br>addressed an edifying exhortation to them. He imagined to himself<br>vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed,<br>imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the three<br>objects mentioned by the Rhetor, this last, that of improving mankind,<br>especially appealed to Pierre. The important mystery mentioned by the<br>Rhetor, though it aroused his curiosity, did not seem to him essential,<br>and the second aim, that of purifying and regenerating himself, did not<br>much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he<br>was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all<br>that was good.<br><br>Half an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the<br>seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon’s temple,<br>which every Freemason should cultivate in himself. These virtues were:<br>1. Discretion, the keeping of the secrets of the Order. 2. Obedience to<br>those of higher ranks in the Order. 3. Morality. 4. Love of mankind. 5.<br>Courage. 6. Generosity. 7. The love of death.<br><br>“In the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of death,” the<br>Rhetor said, “to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but<br>as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue<br>from this distressful life, and leads it to its place of recompense and<br>peace.”<br><br>“Yes, that must be so,” thought Pierre, when after these words the<br>Rhetor went away, leaving him to solitary meditation. “It must be so,<br>but I am still so weak that I love my life, the meaning of which is only<br>now gradually opening before me.” But five of the other virtues which<br>Pierre recalled, counting them on his fingers, he felt already in his<br>soul: courage, generosity, morality, love of mankind, and especially<br>obedience—which did not even seem to him a virtue, but a joy. (He now<br>felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will<br>to those who knew the indubitable truth.) He forgot what the seventh<br>virtue was and could not recall it.<br><br>The third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre<br>whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to<br>all that would be required of him.<br><br>“I am ready for everything,” said Pierre.<br><br>“I must also inform you,” said the Rhetor, “that our Order<br>delivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means, which<br>may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom<br>and virtue than mere words. This chamber with what you see therein<br>should already have suggested to your heart, if it is sincere, more than<br>words could do. You will perhaps also see in your further initiation a<br>like method of enlightenment. Our Order imitates the ancient societies<br>that explained their teaching by hieroglyphics. A hieroglyph,” said<br>the Rhetor, “is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses<br>but which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol.”<br><br>Pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but dared not speak. He<br>listened to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that his<br>ordeal was about to begin.<br><br>“If you are resolved, I must begin your initiation,” said the Rhetor<br>coming closer to Pierre. “In token of generosity I ask you to give me<br>all your valuables.”<br><br>“But I have nothing here,” replied Pierre, supposing that he was<br>asked to give up all he possessed.<br><br>“What you have with you: watch, money, rings....”<br><br>Pierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could not manage for<br>some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that had been<br>done, the Rhetor said:<br><br>“In token of obedience, I ask you to undress.”<br><br>Pierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according to the<br>Rhetor’s instructions. The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierre’s<br>left breast, and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers<br>to above the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also<br>and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the<br>trouble, but the Mason told him that was not necessary and gave him<br>a slipper for his left foot. With a childlike smile of embarrassment,<br>doubt, and self-derision, which appeared on his face against his will,<br>Pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart, before his<br>brother Rhetor, and awaited his further commands.<br><br>“And now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to me your chief<br>passion,” said the latter.<br><br>“My passion! I have had so many,” replied Pierre.<br><br>“That passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the<br>path of virtue,” said the Mason.<br><br>Pierre paused, seeking a reply.<br><br>“Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? Women?”<br>He went over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of them to give<br>the pre-eminence.<br><br>“Women,” he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.<br><br>The Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this<br>answer. At last he moved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief that lay<br>on the table, again bound his eyes.<br><br>“For the last time I say to you—turn all your attention upon<br>yourself, put a bridle on your senses, and seek blessedness, not in<br>passion but in your own heart. The source of blessedness is not without<br>us but within....”<br><br>Pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source<br>of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>Soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre, not<br>the Rhetor but Pierre’s sponsor, Willarski, whom he recognized by his<br>voice. To fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution Pierre<br>replied: “Yes, yes, I agree,” and with a beaming, childlike smile,<br>his fat chest uncovered, stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered<br>and one booted foot, he advanced, while Willarski held a sword to his<br>bare chest. He was conducted from that room along passages that turned<br>backwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the<br>Lodge. Willarski coughed, he was answered by the Masonic knock with<br>mallets, the doors opened before them. A bass voice (Pierre was still<br>blindfolded) questioned him as to who he was, when and where he was<br>born, and so on. Then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded,<br>and as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his<br>pilgrimage, of holy friendship, of the Eternal Architect of the<br>universe, and of the courage with which he should endure toils and<br>dangers. During these wanderings, Pierre noticed that he was spoken<br>of now as the “Seeker,” now as the “Sufferer,” and now as the<br>“Postulant,” to the accompaniment of various knockings with<br>mallets and swords. As he was being led up to some object he noticed a<br>hesitation and uncertainty among his conductors. He heard those around<br>him disputing in whispers and one of them insisting that he should be<br>led along a certain carpet. After that they took his right hand, placed<br>it on something, and told him to hold a pair of compasses to his left<br>breast with the other hand and to repeat after someone who read aloud<br>an oath of fidelity to the laws of the Order. The candles were then<br>extinguished and some spirit lighted, as Pierre knew by the smell, and<br>he was told that he would now see the lesser light. The bandage was<br>taken off his eyes and, by the faint light of the burning spirit,<br>Pierre, as in a dream, saw several men standing before him, wearing<br>aprons like the Rhetor’s and holding swords in their hands pointed at<br>his breast. Among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with<br>blood. On seeing this, Pierre moved forward with his breast toward the<br>swords, meaning them to pierce it. But the swords were drawn back from<br>him and he was at once blindfolded again.<br><br>“Now thou hast seen the lesser light,” uttered a voice. Then the<br>candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the<br>bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together: “Sic<br>transit gloria mundi.”<br><br>Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room<br>and at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black sat some<br>twelve men in garments like those he had already seen. Some of them<br>Pierre had met in Petersburg society. In the President’s chair sat a<br>young man he did not know, with a peculiar cross hanging from his<br>neck. On his right sat the Italian abbé whom Pierre had met at<br>Anna Pávlovna’s two years before. There were also present a very<br>distinguished dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the<br>Kurágins’. All maintained a solemn silence, listening to the words<br>of the President, who held a mallet in his hand. Let into the wall was<br>a star-shaped light. At one side of the table was a small carpet with<br>various figures worked upon it, at the other was something resembling an<br>altar on which lay a Testament and a skull. Round it stood seven large<br>candlesticks like those used in churches. Two of the brothers led Pierre<br>up to the altar, placed his feet at right angles, and bade him lie down,<br>saying that he must prostrate himself at the Gates of the Temple.<br><br>“He must first receive the trowel,” whispered one of the brothers.<br><br>“Oh, hush, please!” said another.<br><br>Pierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes without<br>obeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his mind. “Where am I? What am<br>I doing? Aren’t they laughing at me? Shan’t I be ashamed to remember<br>this?” But these doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre glanced at<br>the serious faces of those around, remembered all he had already gone<br>through, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was aghast<br>at his hesitation and, trying to arouse his former devotional feeling,<br>prostrated himself before the Gates of the Temple. And really, the<br>feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before. When<br>he had lain there some time, he was told to get up, and a white leather<br>apron, such as the others wore, was put on him: he was given a trowel<br>and three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand Master addressed him. He<br>told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that<br>apron, which symbolized strength and purity; then of the unexplained<br>trowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice,<br>and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor. As to the<br>first pair of gloves, a man’s, he said that Pierre could not know<br>their meaning but must keep them. The second pair of man’s gloves<br>he was to wear at the meetings, and finally of the third, a pair of<br>women’s gloves, he said: “Dear brother, these woman’s gloves are<br>intended for you too. Give them to the woman whom you shall honor most<br>of all. This gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom<br>you select to be your worthy helpmeet in Masonry.” And after a pause,<br>he added: “But beware, dear brother, that these gloves do not deck<br>hands that are unclean.” While the Grand Master said these last words<br>it seemed to Pierre that he grew embarrassed. Pierre himself grew still<br>more confused, blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes, began<br>looking about him uneasily, and an awkward pause followed.<br><br>This silence was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre up to the<br>rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of<br>all the figures on it: the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a<br>trowel, a rough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three windows, and<br>so on. Then a place was assigned to Pierre, he was shown the signs of<br>the Lodge, told the password, and at last was permitted to sit down.<br>The Grand Master began reading the statutes. They were very long, and<br>Pierre, from joy, agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a state to<br>understand what was being read. He managed to follow only the last words<br>of the statutes and these remained in his mind.<br><br>“In our temples we recognize no other distinctions,” read the Grand<br>Master, “but those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any<br>distinctions which may infringe equality. Fly to a brother’s aid<br>whoever he may be, exhort him who goeth astray, raise him that falleth,<br>never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother. Be kindly and courteous.<br>Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue. Share thy happiness with thy<br>neighbor, and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss. Forgive thy<br>enemy, do not avenge thyself except by doing him good. Thus fulfilling<br>the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which<br>thou hast lost.”<br><br>He finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who, with tears<br>of joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how to answer the<br>congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all<br>sides. He acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only<br>brothers, and burned with impatience to set to work with them.<br><br>The Grand Master rapped with his mallet. All the Masons sat down in<br>their places, and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of<br>humility.<br><br>The Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed,<br>and the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of “Collector<br>of Alms” went round to all the brothers. Pierre would have liked<br>to subscribe all he had, but fearing that it might look like pride<br>subscribed the same amount as the others.<br><br>The meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he had<br>returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years, had<br>become completely changed, and had quite left behind his former habits<br>and way of life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>The day after he had been received into the Lodge, Pierre was sitting at<br>home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square,<br>one side of which symbolized God, another moral things, a third<br>physical things, and the fourth a combination of these. Now and then<br>his attention wandered from the book and the Square and he formed in<br>imagination a new plan of life. On the previous evening at the Lodge, he<br>had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it<br>would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg. Pierre proposed going to his<br>estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs.<br>He was joyfully planning this new life, when Prince Vasíli suddenly<br>entered the room.<br><br>“My dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? Why have you<br>quarreled with Hélène, mon cher? You are under a delusion,” said<br>Prince Vasíli, as he entered. “I know all about it, and I can tell<br>you positively that Hélène is as innocent before you as Christ was<br>before the Jews.”<br><br>Pierre was about to reply, but Prince Vasíli interrupted him.<br><br>“And why didn’t you simply come straight to me as to a friend? I<br>know all about it and understand it all,” he said. “You behaved as<br>becomes a man who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we won’t<br>go into that. But consider the position in which you are placing her and<br>me in the eyes of society, and even of the court,” he added, lowering<br>his voice. “She is living in Moscow and you are here. Remember,<br>dear boy,” and he drew Pierre’s arm downwards, “it is simply a<br>misunderstanding. I expect you feel it so yourself. Let us write her<br>a letter at once, and she’ll come here and all will be explained, or<br>else, my dear boy, let me tell you it’s quite likely you’ll have to<br>suffer for it.”<br><br>Prince Vasíli gave Pierre a significant look.<br><br>“I know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a<br>keen interest in the whole affair. You know she is very gracious to<br>Hélène.”<br><br>Pierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince Vasíli<br>did not let him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared to begin to<br>speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had<br>firmly resolved to answer his father-in-law. Moreover, the words of the<br>Masonic statutes, “be kindly and courteous,” recurred to him. He<br>blinked, went red, got up and sat down again, struggling with himself<br>to do what was for him the most difficult thing in life—to say an<br>unpleasant thing to a man’s face, to say what the other, whoever<br>he might be, did not expect. He was so used to submitting to Prince<br>Vasíli’s tone of careless self-assurance that he felt he would be<br>unable to withstand it now, but he also felt that on what he said now<br>his future depended—whether he would follow the same old road, or that<br>new path so attractively shown him by the Masons, on which he firmly<br>believed he would be reborn to a new life.<br><br>“Now, dear boy,” said Prince Vasíli playfully, “say ‘yes,’<br>and I’ll write to her myself, and we will kill the fatted calf.”<br><br>But before Prince Vasíli had finished his playful speech, Pierre,<br>without looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like his<br>father, muttered in a whisper:<br><br>“Prince, I did not ask you here. Go, please go!” And he jumped up<br>and opened the door for him.<br><br>“Go!” he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of<br>confusion and fear that showed itself on Prince Vasíli’s face.<br><br>“What’s the matter with you? Are you ill?”<br><br>“Go!” the quivering voice repeated. And Prince Vasíli had to go<br>without receiving any explanation.<br><br>A week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons,<br>and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his<br>estates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons<br>and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>The duel between Pierre and Dólokhov was hushed up and, in spite of<br>the Emperor’s severity regarding duels at that time, neither the<br>principals nor their seconds suffered for it. But the story of the duel,<br>confirmed by Pierre’s rupture with his wife, was the talk of society.<br>Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was<br>an illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was the best<br>match in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his<br>marriage—when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing<br>to hope from him—especially as he did not know how, and did not<br>wish, to court society’s favor. Now he alone was blamed for what had<br>happened, he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his<br>father to fits of bloodthirsty rage. And when after Pierre’s<br>departure Hélène returned to Petersburg, she was received by all her<br>acquaintances not only cordially, but even with a shade of deference<br>due to her misfortune. When conversation turned on her husband Hélène<br>assumed a dignified expression, which with characteristic tact she had<br>acquired though she did not understand its significance. This expression<br>suggested that she had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly<br>and that her husband was a cross laid upon her by God. Prince Vasíli<br>expressed his opinion more openly. He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre<br>was mentioned and, pointing to his forehead, remarked:<br><br>“A bit touched—I always said so.”<br><br>“I said from the first,” declared Anna Pávlovna referring to<br>Pierre, “I said at the time and before anyone else” (she insisted<br>on her priority) “that that senseless young man was spoiled by the<br>depraved ideas of these days. I said so even at the time when everybody<br>was in raptures about him, when he had just returned from abroad, and<br>when, if you remember, he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my soirees.<br>And how has it ended? I was against this marriage even then and foretold<br>all that has happened.”<br><br>Anna Pávlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of<br>soirees as before—such as she alone had the gift of arranging—at<br>which was to be found “the cream of really good society, the bloom<br>of the intellectual essence of Petersburg,” as she herself put it.<br>Besides this refined selection of society Anna Pávlovna’s receptions<br>were also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new<br>and interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the<br>state of the political thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court<br>society so dearly and distinctly indicated.<br><br>Toward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleon’s<br>destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstädt and the<br>surrender of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received, when our<br>troops had already entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon<br>was beginning, Anna Pávlovna gave one of her soirees. The “cream of<br>really good society” consisted of the fascinating Hélène, forsaken<br>by her husband, Mortemart, the delightful Prince Hippolyte who had<br>just returned from Vienna, two diplomatists, the old aunt, a young man<br>referred to in that drawing room as “a man of great merit” (un homme<br>de beaucoup de mérite), a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother,<br>and several other less noteworthy persons.<br><br>The novelty Anna Pávlovna was setting before her guests that evening<br>was Borís Drubetskóy, who had just arrived as a special messenger from<br>the Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage.<br><br>The temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that<br>evening was this:<br><br>“Whatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to<br>countenance Bonaparte, and to cause me, and us in general, annoyance and<br>mortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter. We shall not cease<br>to express our sincere views on that subject, and can only say to the<br>King of Prussia and others: ‘So much the worse for you. Tu l’as<br>voulu, George Dandin,’ that’s all we have to say about it!”<br><br>When Borís, who was to be served up to the guests, entered the drawing<br>room, almost all the company had assembled, and the conversation, guided<br>by Anna Pávlovna, was about our diplomatic relations with Austria and<br>the hope of an alliance with her.<br><br>Borís, grown more manly and looking fresh, rosy and self-possessed,<br>entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an<br>aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and<br>then brought back to the general circle.<br><br>Anna Pávlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to<br>several persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered description<br>of each.<br><br>“Prince Hippolyte Kurágin—charming young fellow; M.<br>Kronq,—chargé d’affaires from Copenhagen—a profound intellect,”<br>and simply, “Mr. Shítov—a man of great merit”—this of the man<br>usually so described.<br><br>Thanks to Anna Mikháylovna’s efforts, his own tastes, and the<br>peculiarities of his reserved nature, Borís had managed during his<br>service to place himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp to a<br>very important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to<br>Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He had<br>become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had<br>been so pleased at Olmütz and according to which an ensign might rank<br>incomparably higher than a general, and according to which what was<br>needed for success in the service was not effort or work, or courage, or<br>perseverance, but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can<br>grant rewards, and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his<br>success and at the inability of others to understand these things.<br>In consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life, all<br>his relations with old friends, all his plans for his future, were<br>completely altered. He was not rich, but would spend his last groat to<br>be better dressed than others, and would rather deprive himself of many<br>pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear<br>in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform. He made friends with<br>and sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and<br>who could therefore be of use to him. He liked Petersburg and despised<br>Moscow. The remembrance of the Rostóvs’ house and of his childish<br>love for Natásha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see<br>the Rostóvs since the day of his departure for the army. To be in Anna<br>Pávlovna’s drawing room he considered an important step up in the<br>service, and he at once understood his role, letting his hostess make<br>use of whatever interest he had to offer. He himself carefully scanned<br>each face, appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with<br>each of those present, and the advantages that might accrue. He took<br>the seat indicated to him beside the fair Hélène and listened to the<br>general conversation.<br><br>“Vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable<br>that not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure<br>them, and she doubts the means we have of gaining them. That is the<br>actual phrase used by the Vienna cabinet,” said the Danish chargé<br>d’affaires.<br><br>“The doubt is flattering,” said “the man of profound intellect,”<br>with a subtle smile.<br><br>“We must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of<br>Austria,” said Mortemart. “The Emperor of Austria can never have<br>thought of such a thing, it is only the cabinet that says it.”<br><br>“Ah, my dear vicomte,” put in Anna Pávlovna, “L’Urope” (for<br>some reason she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined<br>French pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with<br>a Frenchman), “L’Urope ne sera jamais notre alliée sincère.” *<br><br>    * “Europe will never be our sincere ally.”<br><br><br>After that Anna Pávlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King<br>of Prussia, in order to draw Borís into the conversation.<br><br>Borís listened attentively to each of the speakers, awaiting his turn,<br>but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor, the<br>beautiful Hélène, whose eyes several times met those of the handsome<br>young aide-de-camp with a smile.<br><br>Speaking of the position of Prussia, Anna Pávlovna very naturally asked<br>Borís to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state he<br>found the Prussian army. Borís, speaking with deliberation, told them<br>in pure, correct French many interesting details about the armies and<br>the court, carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his<br>own about the facts he was recounting. For some time he engrossed the<br>general attention, and Anna Pávlovna felt that the novelty she had<br>served up was received with pleasure by all her visitors. The greatest<br>attention of all to Borís’ narrative was shown by Hélène. She asked<br>him several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in<br>the state of the Prussian army. As soon as he had finished she turned to<br>him with her usual smile.<br><br>“You absolutely must come and see me,” she said in a tone that<br>implied that, for certain considerations he could not know of, this was<br>absolutely necessary.<br><br>“On Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure.”<br><br>Borís promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a<br>conversation with her, when Anna Pávlovna called him away on the<br>pretext that her aunt wished to hear him.<br><br>“You know her husband, of course?” said Anna Pávlovna, closing her<br>eyes and indicating Hélène with a sorrowful gesture. “Ah, she is<br>such an unfortunate and charming woman! Don’t mention him before<br>her—please don’t! It is too painful for her!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>When Borís and Anna Pávlovna returned to the others Prince Hippolyte<br>had the ear of the company.<br><br>Bending forward in his armchair he said: “Le Roi de Prusse!” and<br>having said this laughed. Everyone turned toward him.<br><br>“Le Roi de Prusse?” Hippolyte said interrogatively, again laughing,<br>and then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair. Anna Pávlovna<br>waited for him to go on, but as he seemed quite decided to say no more<br>she began to tell of how at Potsdam the impious Bonaparte had stolen the<br>sword of Frederick the Great.<br><br>“It is the sword of Frederick the Great which I...” she began, but<br>Hippolyte interrupted her with the words: “Le Roi de Prusse...” and<br>again, as soon as all turned toward him, excused himself and said no<br>more.<br><br>Anna Pávlovna frowned. Mortemart, Hippolyte’s friend, addressed him<br>firmly.<br><br>“Come now, what about your Roi de Prusse?”<br><br>Hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing.<br><br>“Oh, it’s nothing. I only wished to say...” (he wanted to repeat<br>a joke he had heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that<br>evening to get in) “I only wished to say that we are wrong to fight<br>pour le Roi de Prusse!”<br><br>Borís smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical<br>or appreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody<br>laughed.<br><br>“Your joke is too bad, it’s witty but unjust,” said Anna<br>Pávlovna, shaking her little shriveled finger at him.<br><br>“We are not fighting pour le Roi de Prusse, but for right principles.<br>Oh, that wicked Prince Hippolyte!” she said.<br><br>The conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the<br>political news. It became particularly animated toward the end of the<br>evening when the rewards bestowed by the Emperor were mentioned.<br><br>“You know N— N— received a snuffbox with the portrait last<br>year?” said “the man of profound intellect.” “Why shouldn’t<br>S— S— get the same distinction?”<br><br>“Pardon me! A snuffbox with the Emperor’s portrait is a reward but<br>not a distinction,” said the diplomatist—“a gift, rather.”<br><br>“There are precedents, I may mention Schwarzenberg.”<br><br>“It’s impossible,” replied another.<br><br>“Will you bet? The ribbon of the order is a different matter....”<br><br>When everybody rose to go, Hélène who had spoken very little all<br>the evening again turned to Borís, asking him in a tone of caressing<br>significant command to come to her on Tuesday.<br><br>“It is of great importance to me,” she said, turning with a smile<br>toward Anna Pávlovna, and Anna Pávlovna, with the same sad smile with<br>which she spoke of her exalted patroness, supported Hélène’s wish.<br><br>It seemed as if from some words Borís had spoken that evening about the<br>Prussian army, Hélène had suddenly found it necessary to see him.<br>She seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on<br>Tuesday.<br><br>But on Tuesday evening, having come to Hélène’s splendid salon,<br>Borís received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for<br>him to come. There were other guests and the countess talked little to<br>him, and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly<br>and in a whisper, with a strangely unsmiling face: “Come to dinner<br>tomorrow... in the evening. You must come.... Come!”<br><br>During that stay in Petersburg, Borís became an intimate in the<br>countess’ house.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>The war was flaming up and nearing the Russian frontier. Everywhere one<br>heard curses on Bonaparte, “the enemy of mankind.” Militiamen and<br>recruits were being enrolled in the villages, and from the seat of<br>war came contradictory news, false as usual and therefore variously<br>interpreted. The life of old Prince Bolkónski, Prince Andrew, and<br>Princess Mary had greatly changed since 1805.<br><br>In 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief<br>then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout Russia.<br>Despite the weakness of age, which had become particularly noticeable<br>since the time when he thought his son had been killed, he did not think<br>it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the Emperor<br>himself, and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy<br>and strength. He was continually traveling through the three provinces<br>entrusted to him, was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties, severe<br>to cruel with his subordinates, and went into everything down to the<br>minutest details himself. Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in<br>mathematics from her father, and when the old prince was at home went<br>to his study with the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his<br>grandfather called him). The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet<br>nurse and nurse Sávishna in the late princess’ rooms and Princess<br>Mary spent most of the day in the nursery, taking a mother’s place to<br>her little nephew as best she could. Mademoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed<br>passionately fond of the boy, and Princess Mary often deprived herself<br>to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angel—as she<br>called her nephew—and playing with him.<br><br>Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the<br>tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument<br>brought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to<br>fly upwards. The angel’s upper lip was slightly raised as though<br>about to smile, and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and<br>Princess Mary admitted to one another that the angel’s face reminded<br>them strangely of the little princess. But what was still stranger,<br>though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the<br>expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel’s face, Prince<br>Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead<br>wife: “Ah, why have you done this to me?”<br><br>Soon after Prince Andrew’s return the old prince made over to him a<br>large estate, Boguchárovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills.<br>Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills,<br>partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with<br>his father’s peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude,<br>Prince Andrew made use of Boguchárovo, began building and spent most of<br>his time there.<br><br>After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not<br>to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced<br>and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the<br>recruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his son<br>seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man,<br>roused by activity, expected the best results from the new campaign,<br>while Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking no part in the war and<br>secretly regretting this, saw only the dark side.<br><br>On February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits.<br>Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his father’s<br>absence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman who<br>had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters<br>for Prince Andrew.<br><br>Not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the<br>letters to Princess Mary’s apartments, but did not find him there. He<br>was told that the prince had gone to the nursery.<br><br>“If you please, your excellency, Pétrusha has brought some papers,”<br>said one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a<br>child’s little chair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he<br>poured drops from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water.<br><br>“What is it?” he said crossly, and, his hand shaking<br>unintentionally, he poured too many drops into the glass. He threw the<br>mixture onto the floor and asked for some more water. The maid brought<br>it.<br><br>There were in the room a child’s cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a<br>table, a child’s table, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew<br>was sitting. The curtains were drawn, and a single candle was burning on<br>the table, screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall<br>on the cot.<br><br>“My dear,” said Princess Mary, addressing her brother from beside<br>the cot where she was standing, “better wait a bit... later...”<br><br>“Oh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things<br>off—and this is what comes of it!” said Prince Andrew in an<br>exasperated whisper, evidently meaning to wound his sister.<br><br>“My dear, really... it’s better not to wake him... he’s asleep,”<br>said the princess in a tone of entreaty.<br><br>Prince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed, wineglass<br>in hand.<br><br>“Perhaps we’d really better not wake him,” he said hesitating.<br><br>“As you please... really... I think so... but as you please,” said<br>Princess Mary, evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion<br>had prevailed. She drew her brother’s attention to the maid who was<br>calling him in a whisper.<br><br>It was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching the boy<br>who was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting their household<br>doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town, they had<br>been trying first one remedy and then another. Worn out by sleeplessness<br>and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and<br>reproached and disputed with each other.<br><br>“Pétrusha has come with papers from your father,” whispered the<br>maid.<br><br>Prince Andrew went out.<br><br>“Devil take them!” he muttered, and after listening to the verbal<br>instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his<br>father’s letter, he returned to the nursery.<br><br>“Well?” he asked.<br><br>“Still the same. Wait, for heaven’s sake. Karl Ivánich always says<br>that sleep is more important than anything,” whispered Princess Mary<br>with a sigh.<br><br>Prince Andrew went up to the child and felt him. He was burning hot.<br><br>“Confound you and your Karl Ivánich!” He took the glass with the<br>drops and again went up to the cot.<br><br>“Andrew, don’t!” said Princess Mary.<br><br>But he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes,<br>and stooped glass in hand over the infant.<br><br>“But I wish it,” he said. “I beg you—give it him!”<br><br>Princess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively<br>and calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child screamed<br>hoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out and sat<br>down on a sofa in the next room.<br><br>He still had all the letters in his hand. Opening them mechanically he<br>began reading. The old prince, now and then using abbreviations, wrote<br>in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows:<br><br>Have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful<br>news—if it’s not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete<br>victory over Buonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing,<br>and the rewards sent to the army are innumerable. Though he is a<br>German—I congratulate him! I can’t make out what the commander at<br>Kórchevo—a certain Khandrikóv—is up to; till now the additional<br>men and provisions have not arrived. Gallop off to him at once and<br>say I’ll have his head off if everything is not here in a week.<br>Have received another letter about the Preussisch-Eylau battle<br>from Pétenka—he took part in it—and it’s all true. When<br>mischief-makers don’t meddle even a German beats Buonaparte. He is<br>said to be fleeing in great disorder. Mind you gallop off to Kórchevo<br>without delay and carry out instructions!<br><br>Prince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. It was<br>a closely written letter of two sheets from Bilíbin. He folded it up<br>without reading it and reread his father’s letter, ending with the<br>words: “Gallop off to Kórchevo and carry out instructions!”<br><br>“No, pardon me, I won’t go now till the child is better,” thought<br>he, going to the door and looking into the nursery.<br><br>Princess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking the baby.<br><br>“Ah yes, and what else did he say that’s unpleasant?” thought<br>Prince Andrew, recalling his father’s letter. “Yes, we have gained<br>a victory over Bonaparte, just when I’m not serving. Yes, yes, he’s<br>always poking fun at me.... Ah, well! Let him!” And he began reading<br>Bilíbin’s letter which was written in French. He read without<br>understanding half of it, read only to forget, if but for a moment, what<br>he had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all<br>else.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>Bilíbin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and<br>though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms,<br>he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and<br>self-derision genuinely Russian. Bilíbin wrote that the obligation of<br>diplomatic discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have in Prince<br>Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he<br>had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army.<br>The letter was old, having been written before the battle at<br>Preussisch-Eylau.<br><br>“Since the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz,” wrote<br>Bilíbin, “as you know, my dear prince, I never leave headquarters. I<br>have certainly acquired a taste for war, and it is just as well for me;<br>what I have seen during these last three months is incredible.<br><br>“I begin ab ovo. ‘The enemy of the human race,’ as you know,<br>attacks the Prussians. The Prussians are our faithful allies who have<br>only betrayed us three times in three years. We take up their cause, but<br>it turns out that ‘the enemy of the human race’ pays no heed to<br>our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the<br>Prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun,<br>and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs<br>himself in the palace at Potsdam.<br><br>“‘I most ardently desire,’ writes the King of Prussia to<br>Bonaparte, ‘that Your Majesty should be received and treated in my<br>palace in a manner agreeable to yourself, and in so far as circumstances<br>allowed, I have hastened to take all steps to that end. May I have<br>succeeded!’ The Prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to<br>the French and lay down their arms at the first demand.<br><br>“The head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the<br>King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender.... All<br>this is absolutely true.<br><br>“In short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude,<br>it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more,<br>in war on our own frontiers, with and for the King of Prussia. We have<br>everything in perfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely,<br>a commander in chief. As it was considered that the Austerlitz success<br>might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so<br>young, all our octogenarians were reviewed, and of Prozoróvski<br>and Kámenski the latter was preferred. The general comes to us,<br>Suvórov-like, in a kibítka, and is received with acclamations of joy<br>and triumph.<br><br>“On the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails<br>are taken to the field marshal’s room, for he likes to do everything<br>himself. I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant<br>for us. The field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed<br>to him. We search, but none are to be found. The field marshal grows<br>impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor<br>to Count T., Prince V., and others. Then he bursts into one of his wild<br>furies and rages at everyone and everything, seizes the letters, opens<br>them, and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others. ‘Ah! So<br>that’s the way they treat me! No confidence in me! Ah, ordered to keep<br>an eye on me! Very well then! Get along with you!’ So he writes the<br>famous order of the day to General Bennigsen:<br><br>“‘I am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the<br>army. You have brought your army corps to Pultúsk, routed: here it is<br>exposed, and without fuel or forage, so something must be done, and, as<br>you yourself reported to Count Buxhöwden yesterday, you must think of<br>retreating to our frontier—which do today.’<br><br>“‘From all my riding,’ he writes to the Emperor, ‘I have got a<br>saddle sore which, coming after all my previous journeys, quite prevents<br>my riding and commanding so vast an army, so I have passed on the<br>command to the general next in seniority, Count Buxhöwden, having sent<br>him my whole staff and all that belongs to it, advising him if there is<br>a lack of bread, to move farther into the interior of Prussia, for only<br>one day’s ration of bread remains, and in some regiments none at all,<br>as reported by the division commanders, Ostermann and Sedmorétzki, and<br>all that the peasants had has been eaten up. I myself will remain in<br>hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover. In regard to which I humbly<br>submit my report, with the information that if the army remains in its<br>present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left<br>in it by spring.<br><br>“‘Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is<br>already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and<br>glorious task for which he was chosen. I shall await your most gracious<br>permission here in hospital, that I may not have to play the part of a<br>secretary rather than commander in the army. My removal from the army<br>does not produce the slightest stir—a blind man has left it. There are<br>thousands such as I in Russia.’<br><br>“The field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all,<br>isn’t it logical?<br><br>“This is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly<br>interesting and entertaining. After the field marshal’s departure<br>it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle.<br>Buxhöwden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen<br>does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who<br>are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity<br>to fight a battle ‘on his own hand’ as the Germans say. He does so.<br>This is the battle of Pultúsk, which is considered a great victory but<br>in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have<br>a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who<br>retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to<br>that it is we who lost the battle of Pultúsk. In short, we retreat<br>after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a<br>victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the<br>post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up<br>the command of the army to General Buxhöwden. During this interregnum<br>we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is<br>no longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to<br>avoid General Buxhöwden who by right of seniority should be our chief.<br>So energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable<br>river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy, who at<br>the moment is not Bonaparte but Buxhöwden. General Buxhöwden was all<br>but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one<br>of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him. Buxhöwden pursues<br>us—we scuttle. He hardly crosses the river to our side before we<br>recross to the other. At last our enemy, Buxhöwden, catches us and<br>attacks. Both generals are angry, and the result is a challenge on<br>Buxhöwden’s part and an epileptic fit on Bennigsen’s. But at the<br>critical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at<br>Pultúsk to Petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in<br>chief, and our first foe, Buxhöwden, is vanquished; we can now turn<br>our thoughts to the second, Bonaparte. But as it turns out, just at<br>that moment a third enemy rises before us—namely the Orthodox Russian<br>soldiers, loudly demanding bread, meat, biscuits, fodder, and whatnot!<br>The stores are empty, the roads impassable. The Orthodox begin looting,<br>and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea. Half the<br>regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything<br>to fire and sword. The inhabitants are totally ruined, the hospitals<br>overflow with sick, and famine is everywhere. Twice the marauders even<br>attack our headquarters, and the commander in chief has to ask for a<br>battalion to disperse them. During one of these attacks they carried off<br>my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown. The Emperor proposes to give<br>all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders, but I much<br>fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other.”<br><br>At first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only, but after a while,<br>in spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust<br>Bilíbin), what he had read began to interest him more and more. When he<br>had read thus far, he crumpled the letter up and threw it away. It was<br>not what he had read that vexed him, but the fact that the life out<br>there in which he had now no part could perturb him. He shut his eyes,<br>rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he<br>had read, and listened to what was passing in the nursery. Suddenly he<br>thought he heard a strange noise through the door. He was seized with<br>alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was<br>reading the letter. He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it.<br><br>Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him<br>with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot.<br><br>“My dear,” he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind<br>him.<br><br>As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, he was<br>seized by an unreasoning panic—it occurred to him that the child was<br>dead. All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror.<br><br>“All is over,” he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on his<br>forehead. He went to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find it<br>empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the<br>curtain aside and for some time his frightened, restless eyes could not<br>find the baby. At last he saw him: the rosy boy had tossed about till he<br>lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow, and was smacking<br>his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly.<br><br>Prince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if he had<br>already lost him. He bent over him and, as his sister had taught him,<br>tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish. The soft<br>forehead was moist. Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand; even<br>the hair was wet, so profusely had the child perspired. He was not dead,<br>but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent. Prince Andrew<br>longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to hold to his heart, this helpless<br>little creature, but dared not do so. He stood over him, gazing at his<br>head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket. He<br>heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of<br>the cot. He did not look round, but still gazing at the infant’s face<br>listened to his regular breathing. The dark shadow was Princess Mary,<br>who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps, lifted the curtain,<br>and dropped it again behind her. Prince Andrew recognized her without<br>looking and held out his hand to her. She pressed it.<br><br>“He has perspired,” said Prince Andrew.<br><br>“I was coming to tell you so.”<br><br>The child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his forehead<br>against the pillow.<br><br>Prince Andrew looked at his sister. In the dim shadow of the curtain her<br>luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that<br>were in them. She leaned over to her brother and kissed him, slightly<br>catching the curtain of the cot. Each made the other a warning gesture<br>and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing<br>to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the<br>world. Prince Andrew was the first to move away, ruffling his hair<br>against the muslin of the curtain.<br><br>“Yes, this is the one thing left me now,” he said with a sigh.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>Soon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierre went to the<br>Kiev province, where he had the greatest number of serfs, taking with<br>him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to<br>what he should do on his estates.<br><br>When he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office<br>and explained to them his intentions and wishes. He told them that steps<br>would be taken immediately to free his serfs—and that till then they<br>were not to be overburdened with labor, women while nursing their babies<br>were not to be sent to work, assistance was to be given to the serfs,<br>punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals,<br>asylums, and schools were to be established on all the estates. Some of<br>the stewards (there were semiliterate foremen among them) listened with<br>alarm, supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased<br>with their management and embezzlement of money, some after their first<br>fright were amused by Pierre’s lisp and the new words they had not<br>heard before, others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked, while<br>the cleverest among them, including the chief steward, understood from<br>this speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends.<br><br>The chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre’s intentions,<br>but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into<br>the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory.<br><br>Despite Count Bezúkhov’s enormous wealth, since he had come into an<br>income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year,<br>Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him<br>an allowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the<br>following budget:<br><br>About 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank, about<br>30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town house,<br>and the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was given in<br>pensions and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was sent to<br>the countess; about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The building of a<br>new church, previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in each of the last<br>two years, and he did not know how the rest, about 100,000 rubles, was<br>spent, and almost every year he was obliged to borrow. Besides this the<br>chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests,<br>or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops. So the first<br>task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or<br>inclination—practical business.<br><br>He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward. But<br>he felt that this did not forward matters at all. He felt that these<br>consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with<br>them or make them move. On the one hand, the chief steward put the state<br>of things to him in the very worst light, pointing out the necessity of<br>paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor,<br>to which Pierre did not agree. On the other hand, Pierre demanded that<br>steps should be taken to liberate the serfs, which the steward met by<br>showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank,<br>and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation.<br><br>The steward did not say it was quite impossible, but suggested selling<br>the forests in the province of Kostromá, the land lower down the river,<br>and the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible: all of which<br>operations according to him were connected with such complicated<br>measures—the removal of injunctions, petitions, permits, and so<br>on—that Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied:<br><br>“Yes, yes, do so.”<br><br>Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him<br>to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried<br>to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it. The steward<br>for his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these<br>consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to<br>himself.<br><br>In Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened to make<br>his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer, the<br>largest landowner of the province. Temptations to Pierre’s greatest<br>weakness—the one to which he had confessed when admitted to the<br>Lodge—were so strong that he could not resist them. Again whole days,<br>weeks, and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much<br>occupied with evening parties, dinners, lunches, and balls, giving him<br>no time for reflection, as in Petersburg. Instead of the new life he had<br>hoped to lead he still lived the old life, only in new surroundings.<br><br>Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not<br>fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral<br>life, and that of the seven virtues he lacked two—morality and the<br>love of death. He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled<br>another of the precepts—that of reforming the human race—and had<br>other virtues—love of his neighbor, and especially generosity.<br><br>In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg. On the way he<br>intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders<br>had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had<br>entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit.<br><br>The chief steward, who considered the young count’s attempts almost<br>insane—unprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the serfs—made<br>some concessions. Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs<br>as impracticable, he arranged for the erection of large<br>buildings—schools, hospitals, and asylums—on all the estates<br>before the master arrived. Everywhere preparations were made not for<br>ceremonious welcomes (which he knew Pierre would not like), but for just<br>such gratefully religious ones, with offerings of icons and the bread<br>and salt of hospitality, as, according to his understanding of his<br>master, would touch and delude him.<br><br>The southern spring, the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna<br>carriage, and the solitude of the road, all had a gladdening effect on<br>Pierre. The estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque<br>than the other; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly<br>grateful for the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere were receptions,<br>which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the<br>depth of his heart. In one place the peasants presented him with bread<br>and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, asking permission,<br>as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them,<br>to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor<br>of Peter and Paul, his patron saints. In another place the women with<br>infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard<br>work. On a third estate the priest, bearing a cross, came to meet<br>him surrounded by children whom, by the count’s generosity, he was<br>instructing in reading, writing, and religion. On all his estates Pierre<br>saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection,<br>all on one plan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were soon<br>to be opened. Everywhere he saw the stewards’ accounts, according to<br>which the serfs’ manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the<br>touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue<br>coats.<br><br>What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him<br>with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and<br>Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peter’s day,<br>and that the richest peasants (who formed the deputation) had begun<br>the chantry long before, but that nine tenths of the peasants in that<br>villages were in a state of the greatest poverty. He did not know that<br>since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land, they<br>did still harder work on their own land. He did not know that the priest<br>who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions, and<br>that the pupils’ parents wept at having to let him take their children<br>and secured their release by heavy payments. He did not know that the<br>brick buildings, built to plan, were being built by serfs whose manorial<br>labor was thus increased, though lessened on paper. He did not know<br>that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs’<br>payments had been diminished by a third, their obligatory manorial work<br>had been increased by a half. And so Pierre was delighted with his visit<br>to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which<br>he had left Petersburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his<br>“brother-instructor” as he called the Grand Master.<br><br>“How easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good,”<br>thought Pierre, “and how little attention we pay to it!”<br><br>He was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed at<br>receiving it. This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do<br>for these simple, kindly people.<br><br>The chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly<br>through the naïve and intelligent count and played with him as with<br>a toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre,<br>pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all<br>the uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it was.<br><br>Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be<br>difficult to imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would<br>happen to them when they were free, but he insisted, though reluctantly,<br>on what he thought right. The steward promised to do all in his power to<br>carry out the count’s wishes, seeing clearly that not only would the<br>count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for<br>the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank,<br>but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the<br>newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued<br>to give in money and work all that other people’s serfs gave—that is<br>to say, all that could be got out of them.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state<br>of mind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his<br>friend Bolkónski, whom he had not seen for two years.<br><br>Boguchárovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among<br>fields and forests of fir and birch, which were partly cut down. The<br>house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and<br>with banks still bare of grass. It was at the end of a village that<br>stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were<br>a few fir trees.<br><br>The homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, stables, a<br>bathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular façade<br>still in course of construction. Round the house was a garden newly laid<br>out. The fences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps and a<br>water cart, painted green, stood in a shed; the paths were straight,<br>the bridges were strong and had handrails. Everything bore an impress of<br>tidiness and good management. Some domestic serfs Pierre met, in reply<br>to inquiries as to where the prince lived, pointed out a small newly<br>built lodge close to the pond. Antón, a man who had looked after Prince<br>Andrew in his boyhood, helped Pierre out of his carriage, said that the<br>prince was at home, and showed him into a clean little anteroom.<br><br>Pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after<br>the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in<br>Petersburg.<br><br>He quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered<br>wooden walls redolent of pine, and would have gone farther, but Antón<br>ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.<br><br>“Well, what is it?” came a sharp, unpleasant voice.<br><br>“A visitor,” answered Antón.<br><br>“Ask him to wait,” and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed<br>back.<br><br>Pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to<br>face with Prince Andrew, who came out frowning and looking old. Pierre<br>embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek<br>and looked at him closely.<br><br>“Well, I did not expect you, I am very glad,” said Prince Andrew.<br><br>Pierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise. He<br>was struck by the change in him. His words were kindly and there was a<br>smile on his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in<br>spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous<br>and glad sparkle. Prince Andrew had grown thinner, paler, and more<br>manly-looking, but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used<br>to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged<br>concentration on some one thought.<br><br>As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation,<br>it was long before their conversation could settle on anything. They<br>put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to<br>be talked over at length. At last the conversation gradually settled on<br>some of the topics at first lightly touched on: their past life, plans<br>for the future, Pierre’s journeys and occupations, the war, and so<br>on. The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his<br>friend’s look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile<br>with which he listened to Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful<br>animation of the past or the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would<br>have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not.<br>The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his<br>enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince<br>Andrew’s presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views,<br>which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour.<br>He checked himself, fearing to seem naïve, yet he felt an irresistible<br>desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite<br>different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg.<br><br>“I can’t tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly<br>know myself again.”<br><br>“Yes, we have altered much, very much, since then,” said Prince<br>Andrew.<br><br>“Well, and you? What are your plans?”<br><br>“Plans!” repeated Prince Andrew ironically. “My plans?” he said,<br>as if astonished at the word. “Well, you see, I’m building. I mean<br>to settle here altogether next year....”<br><br>Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew’s face,<br>which had grown much older.<br><br>“No, I meant to ask...” Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted<br>him.<br><br>“But why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels<br>and all you have been doing on your estates.”<br><br>Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far<br>as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been<br>made. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre’s story of what he<br>had been doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he listened<br>not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was<br>telling him.<br><br>Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend’s company<br>and at last became silent.<br><br>“I’ll tell you what, my dear fellow,” said Prince Andrew, who<br>evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor, “I am<br>only bivouacking here and have just come to look round. I am going back<br>to my sister today. I will introduce you to her. But of course you know<br>her already,” he said, evidently trying to entertain a visitor with<br>whom he now found nothing in common. “We will go after dinner. And<br>would you now like to look round my place?”<br><br>They went out and walked about till dinnertime, talking of the political<br>news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other<br>intimately. Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of<br>the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings, but even here,<br>while on the scaffolding, in the midst of a talk explaining the future<br>arrangements of the house, he interrupted himself:<br><br>“However, this is not at all interesting. Let us have dinner, and then<br>we’ll set off.”<br><br>At dinner, conversation turned on Pierre’s marriage.<br><br>“I was very much surprised when I heard of it,” said Prince Andrew.<br><br>Pierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and said<br>hurriedly: “I will tell you some time how it all happened. But you<br>know it is all over, and forever.”<br><br>“Forever?” said Prince Andrew. “Nothing’s forever.”<br><br>“But you know how it all ended, don’t you? You heard of the duel?”<br><br>“And so you had to go through that too!”<br><br>“One thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,” said<br>Pierre.<br><br>“Why so?” asked Prince Andrew. “To kill a vicious dog is a very<br>good thing really.”<br><br>“No, to kill a man is bad—wrong.”<br><br>“Why is it wrong?” urged Prince Andrew. “It is not given to man<br>to know what is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will<br>err, and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.”<br><br>“What does harm to another is wrong,” said Pierre, feeling with<br>pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was<br>roused, had begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought him to<br>his present state.<br><br>“And who has told you what is bad for another man?” he asked.<br><br>“Bad! Bad!” exclaimed Pierre. “We all know what is bad for<br>ourselves.”<br><br>“Yes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is<br>something I cannot inflict on others,” said Prince Andrew, growing<br>more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook<br>to Pierre. He spoke in French. “I only know two very real evils in<br>life: remorse and illness. The only good is the absence of those evils.<br>To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy<br>now.”<br><br>“And love of one’s neighbor, and self-sacrifice?” began Pierre.<br>“No, I can’t agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil and<br>not to have to repent is not enough. I lived like that, I lived for<br>myself and ruined my life. And only now when I am living, or at least<br>trying” (Pierre’s modesty made him correct himself) “to live for<br>others, only now have I understood all the happiness of life. No, I<br>shall not agree with you, and you do not really believe what you are<br>saying.” Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.<br><br>“When you see my sister, Princess Mary, you’ll get on with her,”<br>he said. “Perhaps you are right for yourself,” he added after<br>a short pause, “but everyone lives in his own way. You lived for<br>yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness<br>when you began living for others. I experienced just the reverse. I<br>lived for glory.—And after all what is glory? The same love of others,<br>a desire to do something for them, a desire for their approval.—So I<br>lived for others, and not almost, but quite, ruined my life. And I have<br>become calmer since I began to live only for myself.”<br><br>“But what do you mean by living only for yourself?” asked Pierre,<br>growing excited. “What about your son, your sister, and your<br>father?”<br><br>“But that’s just the same as myself—they are not others,”<br>explained Prince Andrew. “The others, one’s neighbors, le prochain,<br>as you and Princess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and<br>evil. Le prochain—your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good.”<br><br>And he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He<br>evidently wished to draw him on.<br><br>“You are joking,” replied Pierre, growing more and more excited.<br>“What error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good, and even<br>doing a little—though I did very little and did it very badly? What<br>evil can there be in it if unfortunate people, our serfs, people like<br>ourselves, were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth<br>beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in<br>a comforting belief in future life, retribution, recompense, and<br>consolation? What evil and error are there in it, if people were dying<br>of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be<br>rendered, and I supplied them with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum<br>for the aged? And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a<br>peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give<br>them rest and leisure?” said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. “And<br>I have done that though badly and to a small extent; but I have done<br>something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good<br>action, and more than that, you can’t make me believe that you do not<br>think so yourself. And the main thing is,” he continued, “that I<br>know, and know for certain, that the enjoyment of doing this good is the<br>only sure happiness in life.”<br><br>“Yes, if you put it like that it’s quite a different matter,” said<br>Prince Andrew. “I build a house and lay out a garden, and you build<br>hospitals. The one and the other may serve as a pastime. But what’s<br>right and what’s good must be judged by one who knows all, but not by<br>us. Well, you want an argument,” he added, “come on then.”<br><br>They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served<br>as a veranda.<br><br>“Come, let’s argue then,” said Prince Andrew, “You talk of<br>schools,” he went on, crooking a finger, “education and so forth;<br>that is, you want to raise him” (pointing to a peasant who passed by<br>them taking off his cap) “from his animal condition and awaken in him<br>spiritual needs, while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only<br>happiness possible, and that is just what you want to deprive him of.<br>I envy him, but you want to make him what I am, without giving him my<br>means. Then you say, ‘lighten his toil.’ But as I see it, physical<br>labor is as essential to him, as much a condition of his existence, as<br>mental activity is to you or me. You can’t help thinking. I go to bed<br>after two in the morning, thoughts come and I can’t sleep but toss<br>about till dawn, because I think and can’t help thinking, just as<br>he can’t help plowing and mowing; if he didn’t, he would go to the<br>drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible physical<br>labor but should die of it in a week, so he could not stand my physical<br>idleness, but would grow fat and die. The third thing—what else was<br>it you talked about?” and Prince Andrew crooked a third finger. “Ah,<br>yes, hospitals, medicine. He has a fit, he is dying, and you come and<br>bleed him and patch him up. He will drag about as a cripple, a burden to<br>everybody, for another ten years. It would be far easier and simpler for<br>him to die. Others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is.<br>It would be different if you grudged losing a laborer—that’s how I<br>regard him—but you want to cure him from love of him. And he does not<br>want that. And besides, what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone!<br>Killed them, yes!” said he, frowning angrily and turning away from<br>Pierre.<br><br>Prince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was<br>evident he had reflected on this subject more than once, and he spoke<br>readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time. His<br>glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless.<br><br>“Oh, that is dreadful, dreadful!” said Pierre. “I don’t<br>understand how one can live with such ideas. I had such moments<br>myself not long ago, in Moscow and when traveling, but at such times I<br>collapsed so that I don’t live at all—everything seems hateful to<br>me... myself most of all. Then I don’t eat, don’t wash... and how is<br>it with you?...”<br><br>“Why not wash? That is not cleanly,” said Prince Andrew; “on the<br>contrary one must try to make one’s life as pleasant as possible.<br>I’m alive, that is not my fault, so I must live out my life as best I<br>can without hurting others.”<br><br>“But with such ideas what motive have you for living? One would sit<br>without moving, undertaking nothing....”<br><br>“Life as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful to do<br>nothing, but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the<br>honor to choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to get<br>out of it. They could not understand that I have not the necessary<br>qualifications for it—the kind of good-natured, fussy shallowness<br>necessary for the position. Then there’s this house, which must be<br>built in order to have a nook of one’s own in which to be quiet. And<br>now there’s this recruiting.”<br><br>“Why aren’t you serving in the army?”<br><br>“After Austerlitz!” said Prince Andrew gloomily. “No, thank you<br>very much! I have promised myself not to serve again in the active<br>Russian army. And I won’t—not even if Bonaparte were here at<br>Smolénsk threatening Bald Hills—even then I wouldn’t serve in the<br>Russian army! Well, as I was saying,” he continued, recovering his<br>composure, “now there’s this recruiting. My father is chief in<br>command of the Third District, and my only way of avoiding active<br>service is to serve under him.”<br><br>“Then you are serving?”<br><br>“I am.”<br><br>He paused a little while.<br><br>“And why do you serve?”<br><br>“Why, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men of<br>his time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he has too<br>energetic a character. He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is<br>terrible, and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of<br>the recruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I had been two hours late<br>a fortnight ago he would have had a paymaster’s clerk at Yúkhnovna<br>hanged,” said Prince Andrew with a smile. “So I am serving because<br>I alone have any influence with my father, and now and then can save him<br>from actions which would torment him afterwards.”<br><br>“Well, there you see!”<br><br>“Yes, but it is not as you imagine,” Prince Andrew continued. “I<br>did not, and do not, in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk<br>who had stolen some boots from the recruits; I should even have been<br>very glad to see him hanged, but I was sorry for my father—that again<br>is for myself.”<br><br>Prince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered feverishly<br>while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there was no<br>desire to do good to his neighbor.<br><br>“There now, you wish to liberate your serfs,” he continued; “that<br>is a very good thing, but not for you—I don’t suppose you ever had<br>anyone flogged or sent to Siberia—and still less for your serfs. If<br>they are beaten, flogged, or sent to Siberia, I don’t suppose they are<br>any the worse off. In Siberia they lead the same animal life, and the<br>stripes on their bodies heal, and they are happy as before. But it is<br>a good thing for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon<br>themselves, stifle this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being<br>able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly. It is those people I<br>pity, and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs. You<br>may not have seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those<br>traditions of unlimited power, in time when they grow more irritable,<br>become cruel and harsh, are conscious of it, but cannot restrain<br>themselves and grow more and more miserable.”<br><br>Prince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking<br>that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his<br>father’s case.<br><br>He did not reply.<br><br>“So that’s what I’m sorry for—human dignity, peace of mind,<br>purity, and not the serfs’ backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave<br>as you may, always remain the same backs and foreheads.”<br><br>“No, no! A thousand times no! I shall never agree with you,” said<br>Pierre.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to<br>Bald Hills. Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence now and<br>then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper.<br><br>Pointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making in<br>his husbandry.<br><br>Pierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and<br>apparently immersed in his own thoughts.<br><br>He was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had gone astray, did not<br>see the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid, enlighten, and<br>raise him. But as soon as he thought of what he should say, he felt that<br>Prince Andrew with one word, one argument, would upset all his teaching,<br>and he shrank from beginning, afraid of exposing to possible ridicule<br>what to him was precious and sacred.<br><br>“No, but why do you think so?” Pierre suddenly began, lowering his<br>head and looking like a bull about to charge, “why do you think so?<br>You should not think so.”<br><br>“Think? What about?” asked Prince Andrew with surprise.<br><br>“About life, about man’s destiny. It can’t be so. I myself thought<br>like that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, don’t<br>smile. Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought<br>it was: Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal,<br>aspects of humanity.”<br><br>And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince<br>Andrew. He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed<br>from the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood,<br>and love.<br><br>“Only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the rest<br>is a dream,” said Pierre. “Understand, my dear fellow, that outside<br>this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you<br>that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out<br>his life, like you, merely trying not to harm others. But make our<br>fundamental convictions your own, join our brotherhood, give yourself up<br>to us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once feel yourself, as I<br>have felt myself, a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of<br>which is hidden in heaven,” said Pierre.<br><br>Prince Andrew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence to<br>Pierre’s words. More than once, when the noise of the wheels prevented<br>his catching what Pierre said, he asked him to repeat it, and by the<br>peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrew’s eyes and by his silence,<br>Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would<br>not interrupt him or laugh at what he said.<br><br>They reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to<br>cross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being placed on it,<br>they also stepped on the raft.<br><br>Prince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed silently at<br>the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun.<br><br>“Well, what do you think about it?” Pierre asked. “Why are you<br>silent?”<br><br>“What do I think about it? I am listening to you. It’s all very<br>well.... You say: join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of<br>life, the destiny of man, and the laws which govern the world. But who<br>are we? Men. How is it you know everything? Why do I alone not see what<br>you see? You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth, but I don’t<br>see it.”<br><br>Pierre interrupted him.<br><br>“Do you believe in a future life?” he asked.<br><br>“A future life?” Prince Andrew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no<br>time to reply, took the repetition for a denial, the more readily as he<br>knew Prince Andrew’s former atheistic convictions.<br><br>“You say you can’t see a reign of goodness and truth on earth. Nor<br>could I, and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end<br>of everything. On earth, here on this earth” (Pierre pointed to<br>the fields), “there is no truth, all is false and evil; but in the<br>universe, in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth, and we who<br>are now the children of earth are—eternally—children of the<br>whole universe. Don’t I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast<br>harmonious whole? Don’t I feel that I form one link, one step, between<br>the lower and higher beings, in this vast harmonious multitude of<br>beings in whom the Deity—the Supreme Power if you prefer the term—is<br>manifest? If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man,<br>why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and<br>farther? I feel that I cannot vanish, since nothing vanishes in this<br>world, but that I shall always exist and always have existed. I feel<br>that beyond me and above me there are spirits, and that in this world<br>there is truth.”<br><br>“Yes, that is Herder’s theory,” said Prince Andrew, “but it is<br>not that which can convince me, dear friend—life and death are what<br>convince. What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one, bound<br>up with one’s own life, before whom one was to blame and had hoped to<br>make it right” (Prince Andrew’s voice trembled and he turned away),<br>“and suddenly that being is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to<br>exist.... Why? It cannot be that there is no answer. And I believe there<br>is.... That’s what convinces, that is what has convinced me,” said<br>Prince Andrew.<br><br>“Yes, yes, of course,” said Pierre, “isn’t that what I’m<br>saying?”<br><br>“No. All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the<br>necessity of a future life, but this: when you go hand in hand with<br>someone and all at once that person vanishes there, into nowhere, and<br>you yourself are left facing that abyss, and look in. And I have looked<br>in....”<br><br>“Well, that’s it then! You know that there is a there and there is a<br>Someone? There is the future life. The Someone is—God.”<br><br>Prince Andrew did not reply. The carriage and horses had long since been<br>taken off, onto the farther bank, and reharnessed. The sun had sunk half<br>below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near<br>the ferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the astonishment of the footmen,<br>coachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on the raft and talked.<br><br>“If there is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and<br>man’s highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must<br>live, we must love, and we must believe that we live not only today on<br>this scrap of earth, but have lived and shall live forever, there, in<br>the Whole,” said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky.<br><br>Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to<br>Pierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the<br>sun gleaming on the blue waters. There was perfect stillness. Pierre<br>became silent. The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the<br>current beat softly against it below. Prince Andrew felt as if the sound<br>of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierre’s words, whispering:<br><br>“It is true, believe it.”<br><br>He sighed, and glanced with a radiant, childlike, tender look at<br>Pierre’s face, flushed and rapturous, but yet shy before his superior<br>friend.<br><br>“Yes, if it only were so!” said Prince Andrew. “However, it is<br>time to get on,” he added, and, stepping off the raft, he looked up<br>at the sky to which Pierre had pointed, and for the first time since<br>Austerlitz saw that high, everlasting sky he had seen while lying on<br>that battlefield; and something that had long been slumbering, something<br>that was best within him, suddenly awoke, joyful and youthful, in his<br>soul. It vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions<br>of his life, but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to<br>develop existed within him. His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in<br>Prince Andrew’s life. Though outwardly he continued to live in the<br>same old way, inwardly he began a new life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front<br>entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they approached the house,<br>Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierre’s attention to a commotion<br>going on at the back porch. A woman, bent with age, with a wallet on her<br>back, and a short, long-haired, young man in a black garment had rushed<br>back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up. Two women ran out<br>after them, and all four, looking round at the carriage, ran in dismay<br>up the steps of the back porch.<br><br>“Those are Mary’s ‘God’s folk,’” said Prince Andrew. “They<br>have mistaken us for my father. This is the one matter in which she<br>disobeys him. He orders these pilgrims to be driven away, but she<br>receives them.”<br><br>“But what are ‘God’s folk’?” asked Pierre.<br><br>Prince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out to meet them,<br>and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back<br>soon.<br><br>The old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute.<br><br>Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always kept<br>in perfect order and readiness for him in his father’s house; he<br>himself went to the nursery.<br><br>“Let us go and see my sister,” he said to Pierre when he returned.<br>“I have not found her yet, she is hiding now, sitting with her<br>‘God’s folk.’ It will serve her right, she will be confused, but<br>you will see her ‘God’s folk.’ It’s really very curious.”<br><br>“What are ‘God’s folk’?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“Come, and you’ll see for yourself.”<br><br>Princess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face<br>when they went in. In her snug room, with lamps burning before the icon<br>stand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing a monk’s<br>cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar. Near them, in an<br>armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, with a meek expression on<br>her childlike face.<br><br>“Andrew, why didn’t you warn me?” said the princess, with mild<br>reproach, as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her<br>chickens.<br><br>“Charmée de vous voir. Je suis très contente de vous voir,” * she<br>said to Pierre as he kissed her hand. She had known him as a child, and<br>now his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife, and above<br>all his kindly, simple face disposed her favorably toward him. She<br>looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say, “I<br>like you very much, but please don’t laugh at my people.” After<br>exchanging the first greetings, they sat down.<br><br>    * “Delighted to see you. I am very glad to see you.”<br><br><br>“Ah, and Ivánushka is here too!” said Prince Andrew, glancing with<br>a smile at the young pilgrim.<br><br>“Andrew!” said Princess Mary, imploringly. “Il faut que vous<br>sachiez que c’est une femme,” * said Prince Andrew to Pierre.<br><br>“Andrew, au nom de Dieu!” *(2) Princess Mary repeated.<br><br>     * “You must know that this is a woman.”<br><br>     * (2) “For heaven’s sake.”<br><br><br>It was evident that Prince Andrew’s ironical tone toward the pilgrims<br>and Princess Mary’s helpless attempts to protect them were their<br>customary long-established relations on the matter.<br><br>“Mais, ma bonne amie,” said Prince Andrew, “vous devriez au<br>contraire m’être reconnaissante de ce que j’explique à Pierre<br>votre intimité avec ce jeune homme.” *<br><br>     * “But, my dear, you ought on the contrary to be grateful to<br>     me for explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young<br>     man.”<br><br><br>“Really?” said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and<br>seriousness (for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him) into<br>Ivánushka’s face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about, looked<br>round at them all with crafty eyes.<br><br>Princess Mary’s embarrassment on her people’s account was quite<br>unnecessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old woman, lowering<br>her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers, had turned her cup<br>upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it, and sat<br>quietly in her armchair, though hoping to be offered another cup of tea.<br>Ivánushka, sipping out of her saucer, looked with sly womanish eyes<br>from under her brows at the young men.<br><br>“Where have you been? To Kiev?” Prince Andrew asked the old woman.<br><br>“I have, good sir,” she answered garrulously. “Just at<br>Christmastime I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly<br>sacrament at the shrine of the saint. And now I’m from Kolyázin,<br>master, where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed.”<br><br>“And was Ivánushka with you?”<br><br>“I go by myself, benefactor,” said Ivánushka, trying to speak in a<br>bass voice. “I only came across Pelagéya in Yúkhnovo....”<br><br>Pelagéya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to tell what<br>she had seen.<br><br>“In Kolyázin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed.”<br><br>“What is it? Some new relics?” asked Prince Andrew.<br><br>“Andrew, do leave off,” said Princess Mary. “Don’t tell him,<br>Pelagéya.”<br><br>“No... why not, my dear, why shouldn’t I? I like him. He is kind,<br>he is one of God’s chosen, he’s a benefactor, he once gave me ten<br>rubles, I remember. When I was in Kiev, Crazy Cyril says to me (he’s<br>one of God’s own and goes barefoot summer and winter), he says,<br>‘Why are you not going to the right place? Go to Kolyázin where a<br>wonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed.’ On<br>hearing those words I said good-by to the holy folk and went.”<br><br>All were silent, only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones,<br>drawing in her breath.<br><br>“So I come, master, and the people say to me: ‘A great blessing has<br>been revealed, holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother,<br>the Holy Virgin Mother of God.’...”<br><br>“All right, all right, you can tell us afterwards,” said Princess<br>Mary, flushing.<br><br>“Let me ask her,” said Pierre. “Did you see it yourselves?” he<br>inquired.<br><br>“Oh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a brightness on the face<br>like the light of heaven, and from the blessed Mother’s cheek it drops<br>and drops....”<br><br>“But, dear me, that must be a fraud!” said Pierre, naïvely, who had<br>listened attentively to the pilgrim.<br><br>“Oh, master, what are you saying?” exclaimed the horrified<br>Pelagéya, turning to Princess Mary for support.<br><br>“They impose on the people,” he repeated.<br><br>“Lord Jesus Christ!” exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing herself.<br>“Oh, don’t speak so, master! There was a general who did not<br>believe, and said, ‘The monks cheat,’ and as soon as he’d said it<br>he went blind. And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev<br>catacombs came to him and said, ‘Believe in me and I will make you<br>whole.’ So he begged: ‘Take me to her, take me to her.’ It’s the<br>real truth I’m telling you, I saw it myself. So he was brought, quite<br>blind, straight to her, and he goes up to her and falls down and says,<br>‘Make me whole,’ says he, ‘and I’ll give thee what the Tsar<br>bestowed on me.’ I saw it myself, master, the star is fixed into the<br>icon. Well, and what do you think? He received his sight! It’s a sin<br>to speak so. God will punish you,” she said admonishingly, turning to<br>Pierre.<br><br>“How did the star get into the icon?” Pierre asked.<br><br>“And was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general?” said<br>Prince Andrew, with a smile.<br><br>Pelagéya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.<br><br>“Oh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!” she began,<br>her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red. “Master, what have you<br>said? God forgive you!” And she crossed herself. “Lord forgive him!<br>My dear, what does it mean?...” she asked, turning to Princess<br>Mary. She got up and, almost crying, began to arrange her wallet. She<br>evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a<br>house where such things could be said, and was at the same time sorry to<br>have now to forgo the charity of this house.<br><br>“Now, why need you do it?” said Princess Mary. “Why did you come<br>to me?...”<br><br>“Come, Pelagéya, I was joking,” said Pierre. “Princesse, ma<br>parole, je n’ai pas voulu l’offenser. * I did not mean anything,<br>I was only joking,” he said, smiling shyly and trying to efface his<br>offense. “It was all my fault, and Andrew was only joking.”<br><br>    * “Princess, on my word, I did not wish to offend her.”<br><br><br>Pelagéya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierre’s face there was such a<br>look of sincere penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at<br>her and now at Pierre, that she was gradually reassured.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>The pilgrim woman was appeased and, being encouraged to talk, gave a<br>long account of Father Amphilochus, who led so holy a life that his<br>hands smelled of incense, and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks<br>she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs, and how she, taking<br>some dried bread with her, had spent two days in the catacombs with<br>the saints. “I’d pray awhile to one, ponder awhile, then go on to<br>another. I’d sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics, and<br>there was such peace all around, such blessedness, that one don’t want<br>to come out, even into the light of heaven again.”<br><br>Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously. Prince Andrew went out<br>of the room, and then, leaving “God’s folk” to finish their tea,<br>Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room.<br><br>“You are very kind,” she said to him.<br><br>“Oh, I really did not mean to hurt her feelings. I understand them so<br>well and have the greatest respect for them.”<br><br>Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately.<br><br>“I have known you a long time, you see, and am as fond of you as of a<br>brother,” she said. “How do you find Andrew?” she added hurriedly,<br>not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words. “I am very<br>anxious about him. His health was better in the winter, but last spring<br>his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a<br>cure. And I am also very much afraid for him spiritually. He has not a<br>character like us women who, when we suffer, can weep away our sorrows.<br>He keeps it all within him. Today he is cheerful and in good spirits,<br>but that is the effect of your visit—he is not often like that. If<br>you could persuade him to go abroad. He needs activity, and this quiet<br>regular life is very bad for him. Others don’t notice it, but I see<br>it.”<br><br>Toward ten o’clock the men servants rushed to the front door, hearing<br>the bells of the old prince’s carriage approaching. Prince Andrew and<br>Pierre also went out into the porch.<br><br>“Who’s that?” asked the old prince, noticing Pierre as he got out<br>of the carriage.<br><br>“Ah! Very glad! Kiss me,” he said, having learned who the young<br>stranger was.<br><br>The old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre.<br><br>Before supper, Prince Andrew, coming back to his father’s study, found<br>him disputing hotly with his visitor. Pierre was maintaining that a time<br>would come when there would be no more wars. The old prince disputed it<br>chaffingly, but without getting angry.<br><br>“Drain the blood from men’s veins and put in water instead, then<br>there will be no more war! Old women’s nonsense—old women’s<br>nonsense!” he repeated, but still he patted Pierre affectionately<br>on the shoulder, and then went up to the table where Prince Andrew,<br>evidently not wishing to join in the conversation, was looking over the<br>papers his father had brought from town. The old prince went up to him<br>and began to talk business.<br><br>“The marshal, a Count Rostóv, hasn’t sent half his contingent. He<br>came to town and wanted to invite me to dinner—I gave him a pretty<br>dinner!... And there, look at this.... Well, my boy,” the old prince<br>went on, addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder. “A<br>fine fellow—your friend—I like him! He stirs me up. Another says<br>clever things and one doesn’t care to listen, but this one talks<br>rubbish yet stirs an old fellow up. Well, go! Get along! Perhaps I’ll<br>come and sit with you at supper. We’ll have another dispute. Make<br>friends with my little fool, Princess Mary,” he shouted after Pierre,<br>through the door.<br><br>Only now, on his visit to Bald Hills, did Pierre fully realize the<br>strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew. That charm was<br>not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family<br>and with the household. With the stern old prince and the gentle, timid<br>Princess Mary, though he had scarcely known them, Pierre at once felt<br>like an old friend. They were all fond of him already. Not only Princess<br>Mary, who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her<br>most radiant looks, but even the one-year-old “Prince Nicholas” (as<br>his grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken<br>in his arms, and Michael Ivánovich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at<br>him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince.<br><br>The old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on Pierre’s<br>account. And during the two days of the young man’s visit he was<br>extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again.<br><br>When Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together, they<br>began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new<br>acquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one said anything but<br>what was good of him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>When returning from his leave, Rostóv felt, for the first time, how<br>close was the bond that united him to Denísov and the whole regiment.<br><br>On approaching it, Rostóv felt as he had done when approaching his home<br>in Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform<br>of his regiment, when he recognized red-haired Deméntyev and saw the<br>picket ropes of the roan horses, when Lavrúshka gleefully shouted to<br>his master, “The count has come!” and Denísov, who had been asleep<br>on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him,<br>and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival, Rostóv<br>experienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his<br>sister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could<br>not speak. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and<br>precious as his parents’ house.<br><br>When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had<br>been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone<br>out foraging, when he had again entered into all the little interests<br>of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one<br>narrow, unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense of peace, of<br>moral support, and the same sense of being at home here in his own<br>place, as he had felt under the parental roof. But here was none of<br>all that turmoil of the world at large, where he did not know his right<br>place and took mistaken decisions; here was no Sónya with whom he<br>ought, or ought not, to have an explanation; here was no possibility of<br>going there or not going there; here there were not twenty-four hours<br>in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways; there was not<br>that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or<br>farther from him than another; there were none of those uncertain and<br>undefined money relations with his father, and nothing to recall that<br>terrible loss to Dólokhov. Here, in the regiment, all was clear and<br>simple. The whole world was divided into two unequal parts: one, our<br>Pávlograd regiment; the other, all the rest. And the rest was no<br>concern of his. In the regiment, everything was definite: who was<br>lieutenant, who captain, who was a good fellow, who a bad one, and most<br>of all, who was a comrade. The canteenkeeper gave one credit, one’s<br>pay came every four months, there was nothing to think out or decide,<br>you had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the Pávlograd<br>regiment and, when given an order, to do what was clearly, distinctly,<br>and definitely ordered—and all would be well.<br><br>Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental<br>life, Rostóv felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to<br>rest. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was all the pleasanter<br>for him, because, after his loss to Dólokhov (for which, in spite<br>of all his family’s efforts to console him, he could not forgive<br>himself), he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving,<br>not as he had done before, but really well, and by being a perfectly<br>first-rate comrade and officer—in a word, a splendid man altogether, a<br>thing which seemed so difficult out in the world, but so possible in the<br>regiment.<br><br>After his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents<br>in five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved<br>to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his<br>parents.<br><br>Our army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at Pultúsk<br>and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting<br>the Emperor’s arrival and the beginning of a new campaign.<br><br>The Pávlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had<br>served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in<br>Russia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the<br>campaign. It had been neither at Pultúsk nor at Preussisch-Eylau and,<br>when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign,<br>was attached to Plátov’s division.<br><br>Plátov’s division was acting independently of the main army. Several<br>times parts of the Pávlograd regiment had exchanged shots with<br>the enemy, had taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal<br>Oudinot’s carriages. In April the Pávlograds were stationed immovably<br>for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village.<br><br>A thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river broke,<br>and the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions for the<br>men nor fodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports could<br>arrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages,<br>searching for potatoes, but found few even of these.<br><br>Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled—if any<br>remained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken<br>from them; even the soldiers, usually pitiless enough, instead of taking<br>anything from them, often gave them the last of their rations.<br><br>The Pávlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action, but had<br>lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In the hospitals,<br>death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or the swelling<br>that came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and hardly able<br>to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals.<br>When spring came on, the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the<br>ground that looked like asparagus, which, for some reason, they called<br>“Máshka’s sweet root.” It was very bitter, but they wandered<br>about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it,<br>though they were ordered not to do so, as it was a noxious plant. That<br>spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers, a swelling of the<br>arms, legs, and face, which the doctors attributed to eating this root.<br>But in spite of all this, the soldiers of Denísov’s squadron fed<br>chiefly on “Máshka’s sweet root,” because it was the second week<br>that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a<br>pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen.<br><br>The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched<br>roofs and had become terribly thin, though still covered with tufts of<br>felty winter hair.<br><br>Despite this destitution, the soldiers and officers went on living just<br>as usual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms, the<br>hussars formed line for roll call, kept things in order, groomed their<br>horses, polished their arms, brought in straw from the thatched roofs in<br>place of fodder, and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which<br>they rose up hungry, joking about their nasty food and their hunger. As<br>usual, in their spare time, they lit bonfires, steamed themselves before<br>them naked; smoked, picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes, told<br>and listened to stories of Potëmkin’s and Suvórov’s campaigns, or<br>to legends of Alësha the Sly, or the priest’s laborer Mikólka.<br><br>The officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless,<br>half-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and,<br>in general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied themselves as<br>before, some playing cards (there was plenty of money, though there was<br>no food), some with more innocent games, such as quoits and skittles.<br>The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of, partly because<br>nothing certain was known about it, partly because there was a vague<br>feeling that in the main it was going badly.<br><br>Rostóv lived, as before, with Denísov, and since their furlough they<br>had become more friendly than ever. Denísov never spoke of Rostóv’s<br>family, but by the tender friendship his commander showed him, Rostóv<br>felt that the elder hussar’s luckless love for Natásha played a part<br>in strengthening their friendship. Denísov evidently tried to expose<br>Rostóv to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action greeted his<br>safe return with evident joy. On one of his foraging expeditions, in<br>a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of<br>provisions, Rostóv found a family consisting of an old Pole and his<br>daughter with an infant in arms. They were half clad, hungry, too weak<br>to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance. Rostóv<br>brought them to his quarters, placed them in his own lodging, and<br>kept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering. One of his<br>comrades, talking of women, began chaffing Rostóv, saying that he was<br>more wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he<br>introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he had saved. Rostóv took<br>the joke as an insult, flared up, and said such unpleasant things to the<br>officer that it was all Denísov could do to prevent a duel. When<br>the officer had gone away, Denísov, who did not himself know what<br>Rostóv’s relations with the Polish girl might be, began to upbraid<br>him for his quickness of temper, and Rostóv replied:<br><br>“Say what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I can’t tell<br>you how it offended me... because... well, for that reason....”<br><br>Denísov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room<br>without looking at Rostóv, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.<br><br>“Ah, what a mad bweed you Wostóvs are!” he muttered, and Rostóv<br>noticed tears in his eyes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperor’s arrival,<br>but Rostóv had no chance of being present at the review he held at<br>Bartenstein, as the Pávlograds were at the outposts far beyond that<br>place.<br><br>They were bivouacking. Denísov and Rostóv were living in an earth hut,<br>dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf. The<br>hut was made in the following manner, which had then come into vogue. A<br>trench was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eight inches deep,<br>and eight feet long. At one end of the trench, steps were cut out and<br>these formed the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself was the room,<br>in which the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board,<br>lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table. On<br>each side of the trench, the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two<br>and a half feet, and this did duty for bedsteads and couches. The roof<br>was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench<br>and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table.<br>Denísov, who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his<br>squadron liked him, had also a board in the roof at the farther end,<br>with a piece of (broken but mended) glass in it for a window. When it<br>was very cold, embers from the soldiers’ campfire were placed on<br>a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the “reception room”—as<br>Denísov called that part of the hut—and it was then so warm that the<br>officers, of whom there were always some with Denísov and Rostóv, sat<br>in their shirt sleeves.<br><br>In April, Rostóv was on orderly duty. One morning, between seven and<br>eight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers, changed<br>his rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got warm,<br>then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner, and,<br>his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his<br>shirt, lay down on his back, putting his arms under his head. He was<br>pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days<br>for his last reconnoitering expedition, and was awaiting Denísov, who<br>had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk.<br><br>Suddenly he heard Denísov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut,<br>evidently much excited. Rostóv moved to the window to see whom he was<br>speaking to, and saw the quartermaster, Topchéenko.<br><br>“I ordered you not to let them eat that Máshka woot stuff!”<br>Denísov was shouting. “And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchúk<br>bwought some fwom the fields.”<br><br>“I have given the order again and again, your honor, but they don’t<br>obey,” answered the quartermaster.<br><br>Rostóv lay down again on his bed and thought complacently: “Let<br>him fuss and bustle now, my job’s done and I’m lying<br>down—capitally!” He could hear that Lavrúshka—that sly, bold<br>orderly of Denísov’s—was talking, as well as the quartermaster.<br>Lavrúshka was saying something about loaded wagons, biscuits, and oxen<br>he had seen when he had gone out for provisions.<br><br>Then Denísov’s voice was heard shouting farther and farther away.<br>“Saddle! Second platoon!”<br><br>“Where are they off to now?” thought Rostóv.<br><br>Five minutes later, Denísov came into the hut, climbed with muddy boots<br>on the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his things about, took<br>his leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and went out again. In answer to<br>Rostóv’s inquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and crossly<br>that he had some business.<br><br>“Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!” said Denísov<br>going out, and Rostóv heard the hoofs of several horses splashing<br>through the mud. He did not even trouble to find out where Denísov had<br>gone. Having got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not leave<br>the hut till toward evening. Denísov had not yet returned. The weather<br>had cleared up, and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were<br>playing sváyka, laughing as they threw their missiles which buried<br>themselves in the soft mud. Rostóv joined them. In the middle of the<br>game, the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on<br>their skinny horses behind them. The wagons escorted by the hussars drew<br>up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them.<br><br>“There now, Denísov has been worrying,” said Rostóv, “and here<br>are the provisions.”<br><br>“So they are!” said the officers. “Won’t the soldiers be<br>glad!”<br><br>A little behind the hussars came Denísov, accompanied by two infantry<br>officers with whom he was talking.<br><br>Rostóv went to meet them.<br><br>“I warn you, Captain,” one of the officers, a short thin man,<br>evidently very angry, was saying.<br><br>“Haven’t I told you I won’t give them up?” replied Denísov.<br><br>“You will answer for it, Captain. It is mutiny—seizing the transport<br>of one’s own army. Our men have had nothing to eat for two days.”<br><br>“And mine have had nothing for two weeks,” said Denísov.<br><br>“It is robbery! You’ll answer for it, sir!” said the infantry<br>officer, raising his voice.<br><br>“Now, what are you pestewing me for?” cried Denísov, suddenly<br>losing his temper. “I shall answer for it and not you, and you’d<br>better not buzz about here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!” he shouted<br>at the officers.<br><br>“Very well, then!” shouted the little officer, undaunted and not<br>riding away. “If you are determined to rob, I’ll...”<br><br>“Go to the devil! quick ma’ch, while you’re safe and sound!” and<br>Denísov turned his horse on the officer.<br><br>“Very well, very well!” muttered the officer, threateningly, and<br>turning his horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.<br><br>“A dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!” shouted<br>Denísov after him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman can<br>address to a mounted infantryman) and riding up to Rostóv, he burst out<br>laughing.<br><br>“I’ve taken twansports from the infantwy by force!” he said.<br>“After all, can’t let our men starve.”<br><br>The wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an<br>infantry regiment, but learning from Lavrúshka that the transport<br>was unescorted, Denísov with his hussars had seized it by force. The<br>soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely, and they even shared<br>them with the other squadrons.<br><br>The next day the regimental commander sent for Denísov, and holding his<br>fingers spread out before his eyes said:<br><br>“This is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and<br>won’t begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over to the staff<br>and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if<br>possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received. If not, as<br>the demand was booked against an infantry regiment, there will be a row<br>and the affair may end badly.”<br><br>From the regimental commander’s, Denísov rode straight to the staff<br>with a sincere desire to act on this advice. In the evening he came<br>back to his dugout in a state such as Rostóv had never yet seen him in.<br>Denísov could not speak and gasped for breath. When Rostóv asked what<br>was the matter, he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a<br>hoarse, feeble voice.<br><br>Alarmed at Denísov’s condition, Rostóv suggested that he should<br>undress, drink some water, and send for the doctor.<br><br>“Twy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but<br>I’ll always thwash scoundwels... and I’ll tell the Empewo’...<br>Ice...” he muttered.<br><br>The regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely necessary<br>to bleed Denísov. A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy<br>arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him.<br><br>“I get there,” began Denísov. “‘Now then, where’s your<br>chief’s quarters?’ They were pointed out. ‘Please to wait.’<br>‘I’ve widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time<br>to wait. Announce me.’ Vewy well, so out comes their head<br>chief—also took it into his head to lecture me: ‘It’s<br>wobbewy!’—‘Wobbewy,’ I say, ‘is not done by man who seizes<br>pwovisions to feed his soldiers, but by him who takes them to fill his<br>own pockets!’ ‘Will you please be silent?’ ‘Vewy good!’ Then<br>he says: ‘Go and give a weceipt to the commissioner, but your affair<br>will be passed on to headquarters.’ I go to the commissioner. I enter,<br>and at the table... who do you think? No, but wait a bit!... Who is it<br>that’s starving us?” shouted Denísov, hitting the table with the<br>fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down<br>and the tumblers on it jumped about. “Telyánin! ‘What? So it’s<br>you who’s starving us to death! Is it? Take this and this!’ and I<br>hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... ‘Ah, what a... what a...!’<br>and I sta’ted fwashing him... Well, I’ve had a bit of fun I can tell<br>you!” cried Denísov, gleeful and yet angry, his white teeth showing<br>under his black mustache. “I’d have killed him if they hadn’t<br>taken him away!”<br><br>“But what are you shouting for? Calm yourself,” said Rostóv.<br>“You’ve set your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up<br>again.”<br><br>Denísov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he woke calm and<br>cheerful.<br><br>But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rostóv’s and<br>Denísov’s dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed<br>them a paper addressed to Major Denísov from the regimental commander<br>in which inquiries were made about yesterday’s occurrence. The<br>adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad<br>turn: that a court-martial had been appointed, and that in view of the<br>severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded,<br>degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for.<br><br>The case, as represented by the offended parties, was that, after<br>seizing the transports, Major Denísov, being drunk, went to the chief<br>quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief, threatened<br>to strike him, and on being led out had rushed into the office and given<br>two officials a thrashing, and dislocated the arm of one of them.<br><br>In answer to Rostóv’s renewed questions, Denísov said, laughing,<br>that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up<br>in it, but that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did not in the<br>least fear any kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels dared attack<br>him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget.<br><br>Denísov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter, but Rostóv knew him<br>too well not to detect that (while hiding it from others) at heart<br>he feared a court-martial and was worried over the affair, which was<br>evidently taking a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry and notices<br>from the court arrived, and on the first of May, Denísov was ordered<br>to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before<br>the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat<br>office. On the previous day Plátov reconnoitered with two Cossack<br>regiments and two squadrons of hussars. Denísov, as was his wont, rode<br>out in front of the outposts, parading his courage. A bullet fired by<br>a French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg. Perhaps at<br>another time Denísov would not have left the regiment for so slight a<br>wound, but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing<br>at the staff and went into hospital.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVII<br><br>In June the battle of Friedland was fought, in which the Pávlograds did<br>not take part, and after that an armistice was proclaimed. Rostóv, who<br>felt his friend’s absence very much, having no news of him since he<br>left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his<br>affairs, took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit Denísov<br>in hospital.<br><br>The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated<br>by Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, when it is so<br>beautiful out in the fields, the little town presented a particularly<br>dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences, its foul streets,<br>tattered inhabitants, and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about.<br><br>The hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and<br>panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence<br>that had been pulled to pieces. Several bandaged soldiers, with pale<br>swollen faces, were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the<br>yard.<br><br>Directly Rostóv entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of<br>putrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he met a Russian army<br>doctor smoking a cigar. The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant.<br><br>“I can’t tear myself to pieces,” the doctor was saying. “Come to<br>Makár Alexéevich in the evening. I shall be there.”<br><br>The assistant asked some further questions.<br><br>“Oh, do the best you can! Isn’t it all the same?” The doctor<br>noticed Rostóv coming upstairs.<br><br>“What do you want, sir?” said the doctor. “What do you want?<br>The bullets having spared you, do you want to try typhus? This is a<br>pesthouse, sir.”<br><br>“How so?” asked Rostóv.<br><br>“Typhus, sir. It’s death to go in. Only we two, Makéev and I” (he<br>pointed to the assistant), “keep on here. Some five of us doctors have<br>died in this place.... When a new one comes he is done for in a week,”<br>said the doctor with evident satisfaction. “Prussian doctors have been<br>invited here, but our allies don’t like it at all.”<br><br>Rostóv explained that he wanted to see Major Denísov of the hussars,<br>who was wounded.<br><br>“I don’t know. I can’t tell you, sir. Only think! I am alone in<br>charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients! It’s<br>well that the charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee<br>and some lint each month or we should be lost!” he laughed. “Four<br>hundred, sir, and they’re always sending me fresh ones. There are four<br>hundred? Eh?” he asked, turning to the assistant.<br><br>The assistant looked fagged out. He was evidently vexed and impatient<br>for the talkative doctor to go.<br><br>“Major Denísov,” Rostóv said again. “He was wounded at<br>Molliten.”<br><br>“Dead, I fancy. Eh, Makéev?” queried the doctor, in a tone of<br>indifference.<br><br>The assistant, however, did not confirm the doctor’s words.<br><br>“Is he tall and with reddish hair?” asked the doctor.<br><br>Rostóv described Denísov’s appearance.<br><br>“There was one like that,” said the doctor, as if pleased. “That<br>one is dead, I fancy. However, I’ll look up our list. We had a list.<br>Have you got it, Makéev?”<br><br>“Makár Alexéevich has the list,” answered the assistant. “But if<br>you’ll step into the officers’ wards you’ll see for yourself,”<br>he added, turning to Rostóv.<br><br>“Ah, you’d better not go, sir,” said the doctor, “or you may<br>have to stay here yourself.”<br><br>But Rostóv bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant<br>to show him the way.<br><br>“Only don’t blame me!” the doctor shouted up after him.<br><br>Rostóv and the assistant went into the dark corridor. The smell was so<br>strong there that Rostóv held his nose and had to pause and collect<br>his strength before he could go on. A door opened to the right, and an<br>emaciated sallow man on crutches, barefoot and in underclothing, limped<br>out and, leaning against the doorpost, looked with glittering envious<br>eyes at those who were passing. Glancing in at the door, Rostóv<br>saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and<br>overcoats.<br><br>“May I go in and look?”<br><br>“What is there to see?” said the assistant.<br><br>But, just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in,<br>Rostóv entered the soldiers’ ward. The foul air, to which he had<br>already begun to get used in the corridor, was still stronger here. It<br>was a little different, more pungent, and one felt that this was where<br>it originated.<br><br>In the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows,<br>the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls, and<br>leaving a passage in the middle. Most of them were unconscious and<br>paid no attention to the newcomers. Those who were conscious raised<br>themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces, and all looked intently at<br>Rostóv with the same expression of hope, of relief, reproach, and<br>envy of another’s health. Rostóv went to the middle of the room and<br>looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same<br>thing there. He stood still, looking silently around. He had not at all<br>expected such a sight. Just before him, almost across the middle of the<br>passage on the bare floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judge<br>by the cut of his hair. The man lay on his back, his huge arms and legs<br>outstretched. His face was purple, his eyes were rolled back so that<br>only the whites were seen, and on his bare legs and arms which were<br>still red, the veins stood out like cords. He was knocking the back of<br>his head against the floor, hoarsely uttering some word which he kept<br>repeating. Rostóv listened and made out the word. It was “drink,<br>drink, a drink!” Rostóv glanced round, looking for someone who would<br>put this man back in his place and bring him water.<br><br>“Who looks after the sick here?” he asked the assistant.<br><br>Just then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, came in from the<br>next room, marching stiffly, and drew up in front of Rostóv.<br><br>“Good day, your honor!” he shouted, rolling his eyes at Rostóv and<br>evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities.<br><br>“Get him to his place and give him some water,” said Rostóv,<br>pointing to the Cossack.<br><br>“Yes, your honor,” the soldier replied complacently, and rolling<br>his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter, but did not<br>move.<br><br>“No, it’s impossible to do anything here,” thought Rostóv,<br>lowering his eyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an intense<br>look fixed on him on his right, and he turned. Close to the corner, on<br>an overcoat, sat an old, unshaven, gray-bearded soldier as thin as a<br>skeleton, with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on Rostóv.<br>The man’s neighbor on one side whispered something to him, pointing<br>at Rostóv, who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him. He drew<br>nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him, the<br>other had been amputated above the knee. His neighbor on the other side,<br>who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back, was<br>a young soldier with a snub nose. His pale waxen face was still freckled<br>and his eyes were rolled back. Rostóv looked at the young soldier and a<br>cold chill ran down his back.<br><br>“Why, this one seems...” he began, turning to the assistant.<br><br>“And how we’ve been begging, your honor,” said the old soldier,<br>his jaw quivering. “He’s been dead since morning. After all we’re<br>men, not dogs.”<br><br>“I’ll send someone at once. He shall be taken away—taken away at<br>once,” said the assistant hurriedly. “Let us go, your honor.”<br><br>“Yes, yes, let us go,” said Rostóv hastily, and lowering his<br>eyes and shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of<br>reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him, and went out of the<br>room.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>Going along the corridor, the assistant led Rostóv to the officers’<br>wards, consisting of three rooms, the doors of which stood open. There<br>were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or<br>sitting on them. Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing<br>gowns. The first person Rostóv met in the officers’ ward was a thin<br>little man with one arm, who was walking about the first room in a<br>nightcap and hospital dressing gown, with a pipe between his teeth.<br>Rostóv looked at him, trying to remember where he had seen him before.<br><br>“See where we’ve met again!” said the little man. “Túshin,<br>Túshin, don’t you remember, who gave you a lift at Schön Grabern?<br>And I’ve had a bit cut off, you see...” he went on with a smile,<br>pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown. “Looking for<br>Vasíli Dmítrich Denísov? My neighbor,” he added, when he heard<br>who Rostóv wanted. “Here, here,” and Túshin led him into the next<br>room, from whence came sounds of several laughing voices.<br><br>“How can they laugh, or even live at all here?” thought Rostóv,<br>still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong<br>in the soldiers’ ward, and still seeming to see fixed on him those<br>envious looks which had followed him out from both sides, and the face<br>of that young soldier with eyes rolled back.<br><br>Denísov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket, though<br>it was nearly noon.<br><br>“Ah, Wostóv? How are you, how are you?” he called out, still in the<br>same voice as in the regiment, but Rostóv noticed sadly that under this<br>habitual ease and animation some new, sinister, hidden feeling showed<br>itself in the expression of Denísov’s face and the intonations of his<br>voice.<br><br>His wound, though a slight one, had not yet healed even now, six weeks<br>after he had been hit. His face had the same swollen pallor as the faces<br>of the other hospital patients, but it was not this that struck Rostóv.<br>What struck him was that Denísov did not seem glad to see him, and<br>smiled at him unnaturally. He did not ask about the regiment, nor about<br>the general state of affairs, and when Rostóv spoke of these matters<br>did not listen.<br><br>Rostóv even noticed that Denísov did not like to be reminded of the<br>regiment, or in general of that other free life which was going on<br>outside the hospital. He seemed to try to forget that old life and<br>was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers. On<br>Rostóv’s inquiry as to how the matter stood, he at once produced from<br>under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the<br>rough draft of his answer to it. He became animated when he began<br>reading his paper and specially drew Rostóv’s attention to the<br>stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies. His hospital companions,<br>who had gathered round Rostóv—a fresh arrival from the world<br>outside—gradually began to disperse as soon as Denísov began reading<br>his answer. Rostóv noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had<br>already heard that story more than once and were tired of it. Only the<br>man who had the next bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed,<br>gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe, and little one-armed Túshin still<br>listened, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the middle of the reading,<br>the Uhlan interrupted Denísov.<br><br>“But what I say is,” he said, turning to Rostóv, “it would be<br>best simply to petition the Emperor for pardon. They say great rewards<br>will now be distributed, and surely a pardon would be granted....”<br><br>“Me petition the Empewo’!” exclaimed Denísov, in a voice to which<br>he tried hard to give the old energy and fire, but which sounded like<br>an expression of irritable impotence. “What for? If I were a wobber I<br>would ask mercy, but I’m being court-martialed for bwinging wobbers<br>to book. Let them twy me, I’m not afwaid of anyone. I’ve served<br>the Tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen! And am I to be<br>degwaded?... Listen, I’m w’iting to them stwaight. This is what I<br>say: ‘If I had wobbed the Tweasuwy...’”<br><br>“It’s certainly well written,” said Túshin, “but that’s not<br>the point, Vasíli Dmítrich,” and he also turned to Rostóv. “One<br>has to submit, and Vasíli Dmítrich doesn’t want to. You know the<br>auditor told you it was a bad business.”<br><br>“Well, let it be bad,” said Denísov.<br><br>“The auditor wrote out a petition for you,” continued Túshin,<br>“and you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it. No doubt<br>he” (indicating Rostóv) “has connections on the staff. You won’t<br>find a better opportunity.”<br><br>“Haven’t I said I’m not going to gwovel?” Denísov interrupted<br>him, went on reading his paper.<br><br>Rostóv had not the courage to persuade Denísov, though he<br>instinctively felt that the way advised by Túshin and the other<br>officers was the safest, and though he would have been glad to be of<br>service to Denísov. He knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty<br>temper.<br><br>When the reading of Denísov’s virulent reply, which took more than an<br>hour, was over, Rostóv said nothing, and he spent the rest of the day<br>in a most dejected state of mind amid Denísov’s hospital comrades,<br>who had gathered round him, telling them what he knew and listening to<br>their stories. Denísov was moodily silent all the evening.<br><br>Late in the evening, when Rostóv was about to leave, he asked Denísov<br>whether he had no commission for him.<br><br>“Yes, wait a bit,” said Denísov, glancing round at the officers,<br>and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window, where<br>he had an inkpot, and sat down to write.<br><br>“It seems it’s no use knocking one’s head against a wall!” he<br>said, coming from the window and giving Rostóv a large envelope. In<br>it was the petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor, in<br>which Denísov, without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat<br>officials, simply asked for pardon.<br><br>“Hand it in. It seems...”<br><br>He did not finish, but gave a painfully unnatural smile.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIX<br><br>Having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of<br>Denísov’s affairs, Rostóv rode to Tilsit with the letter to the<br>Emperor.<br><br>On the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in<br>Tilsit. Borís Drubetskóy had asked the important personage on whom he<br>was in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at<br>Tilsit.<br><br>“I should like to see the great man,” he said, alluding to Napoleon,<br>whom hitherto he, like everyone else, had always called Buonaparte.<br><br>“You are speaking of Buonaparte?” asked the general, smiling.<br><br>Borís looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was<br>being tested.<br><br>“I am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon,” he replied. The<br>general patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.<br><br>“You will go far,” he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.<br><br>Borís was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two<br>Emperors met. He saw the raft, decorated with monograms, saw Napoleon<br>pass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river, saw the<br>pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern<br>on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleon’s arrival, saw both<br>Emperors get into boats, and saw how Napoleon—reaching the raft<br>first—stepped quickly forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand<br>to him, and how they both retired into the pavilion. Since he had begun<br>to move in the highest circles Borís had made it his habit to watch<br>attentively all that went on around him and to note it down. At the time<br>of the meeting at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with<br>Napoleon and about the uniforms they wore, and listened attentively to<br>words spoken by important personages. At the moment the Emperors went<br>into the pavilion he looked at his watch, and did not forget to look at<br>it again when Alexander came out. The interview had lasted an hour and<br>fifty-three minutes. He noted this down that same evening, among other<br>facts he felt to be of historic importance. As the Emperor’s suite<br>was a very small one, it was a matter of great importance, for a man who<br>valued his success in the service, to be at Tilsit on the occasion of<br>this interview between the two Emperors, and having succeeded in this,<br>Borís felt that henceforth his position was fully assured. He had not<br>only become known, but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted<br>him. Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself, so<br>that the latter knew his face, and all those at court, far from<br>cold-shouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer,<br>would now have been surprised had he been absent.<br><br>Borís lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count Zhilínski.<br>Zhilínski, a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately<br>fond of the French, and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit, French<br>officers of the Guard and from French headquarters were dining and<br>lunching with him and Borís.<br><br>On the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhilínski arranged a<br>supper for his French friends. The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of<br>Napoleon’s, there were also several French officers of the Guard,<br>and a page of Napoleon’s, a young lad of an old aristocratic French<br>family. That same day, Rostóv, profiting by the darkness to avoid being<br>recognized in civilian dress, came to Tilsit and went to the lodging<br>occupied by Borís and Zhilínski.<br><br>Rostóv, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far<br>from having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the<br>French—who from being foes had suddenly become friends—that had<br>taken place at headquarters and in Borís. In the army, Bonaparte and<br>the French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger, contempt,<br>and fear. Only recently, talking with one of Plátov’s Cossack<br>officers, Rostóv had argued that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he<br>would be treated not as a sovereign, but as a criminal. Quite lately,<br>happening to meet a wounded French colonel on the road, Rostóv had<br>maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate<br>sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte. Rostóv was therefore unpleasantly<br>struck by the presence of French officers in Borís’ lodging, dressed<br>in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point<br>of view from the outposts of the flank. As soon as he noticed a French<br>officer, who thrust his head out of the door, that warlike feeling of<br>hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly<br>seized him. He stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether<br>Drubetskóy lived there. Borís, hearing a strange voice in the<br>anteroom, came out to meet him. An expression of annoyance showed itself<br>for a moment on his face on first recognizing Rostóv.<br><br>“Ah, it’s you? Very glad, very glad to see you,” he said, however,<br>coming toward him with a smile. But Rostóv had noticed his first<br>impulse.<br><br>“I’ve come at a bad time I think. I should not have come, but I have<br>business,” he said coldly.<br><br>“No, I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment.<br>Dans un moment je suis à vous,” * he said, answering someone who<br>called him.<br><br>    * “In a minute I shall be at your disposal.”<br><br><br>“I see I’m intruding,” Rostóv repeated.<br><br>The look of annoyance had already disappeared from Borís’ face:<br>having evidently reflected and decided how to act, he very quietly took<br>both Rostóv’s hands and led him into the next room. His eyes, looking<br>serenely and steadily at Rostóv, seemed to be veiled by something,<br>as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality. So it seemed to<br>Rostóv.<br><br>“Oh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!” said Borís,<br>and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and<br>introduced him to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian, but<br>an hussar officer, and an old friend of his.<br><br>“Count Zhilínski—le Comte N. N.—le Capitaine S. S.,” said he,<br>naming his guests. Rostóv looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, bowed<br>reluctantly, and remained silent.<br><br>Zhilínski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very<br>willingly into his circle and did not speak to Rostóv. Borís did not<br>appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and, with the same<br>pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which<br>he had met Rostóv, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the<br>Frenchmen, with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen,<br>addressed the obstinately taciturn Rostóv, saying that the latter had<br>probably come to Tilsit to see the Emperor.<br><br>“No, I came on business,” replied Rostóv, briefly.<br><br>Rostóv had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of<br>dissatisfaction on Borís’ face, and as always happens to those in a<br>bad humor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion<br>and that he was in everybody’s way. He really was in their way, for he<br>alone took no part in the conversation which again became general. The<br>looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say: “And what is he sitting<br>here for?” He rose and went up to Borís.<br><br>“Anyhow, I’m in your way,” he said in a low tone. “Come and talk<br>over my business and I’ll go away.”<br><br>“Oh, no, not at all,” said Borís. “But if you are tired, come and<br>lie down in my room and have a rest.”<br><br>“Yes, really...”<br><br>They went into the little room where Borís slept. Rostóv, without<br>sitting down, began at once, irritably (as if Borís were to blame in<br>some way) telling him about Denísov’s affair, asking him whether,<br>through his general, he could and would intercede with the Emperor on<br>Denísov’s behalf and get Denísov’s petition handed in. When he<br>and Borís were alone, Rostóv felt for the first time that he could not<br>look Borís in the face without a sense of awkwardness. Borís, with one<br>leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender<br>fingers of his right, listened to Rostóv as a general listens to the<br>report of a subordinate, now looking aside and now gazing straight into<br>Rostóv’s eyes with the same veiled look. Each time this happened<br>Rostóv felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes.<br><br>“I have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe<br>in such affairs. I think it would be best not to bring it before the<br>Emperor, but to apply to the commander of the corps.... But in general,<br>I think...”<br><br>“So you don’t want to do anything? Well then, say so!” Rostóv<br>almost shouted, not looking Borís in the face.<br><br>Borís smiled.<br><br>“On the contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought...”<br><br>At that moment Zhilínski’s voice was heard calling Borís.<br><br>“Well then, go, go, go...” said Rostóv, and refusing supper and<br>remaining alone in the little room, he walked up and down for a long<br>time, hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XX<br><br>Rostóv had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition<br>on Denísov’s behalf. He could not himself go to the general in<br>attendance as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission<br>to do so, and Borís, even had he wished to, could not have done so on<br>the following day. On that day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were<br>signed. The Emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander received the Cross<br>of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the<br>First Degree, and a dinner had been arranged for the evening, given by<br>a battalion of the French Guards to the Preobrazhénsk battalion. The<br>Emperors were to be present at that banquet.<br><br>Rostóv felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Borís that, when the<br>latter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and early next<br>morning went away, avoiding Borís. In his civilian clothes and a<br>round hat, he wandered about the town, staring at the French and their<br>uniforms and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French<br>Emperors were staying. In a square he saw tables being set up and<br>preparations made for the dinner; he saw the Russian and French colors<br>draped from side to side of the streets, with huge monograms A and N. In<br>the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed.<br><br>“Borís doesn’t want to help me and I don’t want to ask him.<br>That’s settled,” thought Nicholas. “All is over between us, but<br>I won’t leave here without having done all I can for Denísov and<br>certainly not without getting his letter to the Emperor. The Emperor!...<br>He is here!” thought Rostóv, who had unconsciously returned to the<br>house where Alexander lodged.<br><br>Saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were<br>assembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.<br><br>“I may see him at any moment,” thought Rostóv. “If only I were<br>to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all... could they really<br>arrest me for my civilian clothes? Surely not! He would understand on<br>whose side justice lies. He understands everything, knows everything.<br>Who can be more just, more magnanimous than he? And even if they did<br>arrest me for being here, what would it matter?” thought he, looking<br>at an officer who was entering the house the Emperor occupied. “After<br>all, people do go in.... It’s all nonsense! I’ll go in and hand<br>the letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for Drubetskóy who<br>drives me to it!” And suddenly with a determination he himself did not<br>expect, Rostóv felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to<br>the house.<br><br>“No, I won’t miss my opportunity now, as I did after Austerlitz,”<br>he thought, expecting every moment to meet the monarch, and conscious of<br>the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought. “I will fall at<br>his feet and beseech him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will even<br>thank me. ‘I am happy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice is<br>the greatest happiness,’” Rostóv fancied the sovereign saying. And<br>passing people who looked after him with curiosity, he entered the porch<br>of the Emperor’s house.<br><br>A broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the right he<br>saw a closed door. Below, under the staircase, was a door leading to the<br>lower floor.<br><br>“Whom do you want?” someone inquired.<br><br>“To hand in a letter, a petition, to His Majesty,” said Nicholas,<br>with a tremor in his voice.<br><br>“A petition? This way, to the officer on duty” (he was shown the<br>door leading downstairs), “only it won’t be accepted.”<br><br>On hearing this indifferent voice, Rostóv grew frightened at what<br>he was doing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so<br>fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away,<br>but the official who had questioned him opened the door, and Rostóv<br>entered.<br><br>A short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high boots and<br>a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on, standing in that<br>room, and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a<br>new pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some reason,<br>attracted Rostóv’s attention. This man was speaking to someone in the<br>adjoining room.<br><br>“A good figure and in her first bloom,” he was saying, but on seeing<br>Rostóv, he stopped short and frowned.<br><br>“What is it? A petition?”<br><br>“What is it?” asked the person in the other room.<br><br>“Another petitioner,” answered the man with the braces.<br><br>“Tell him to come later. He’ll be coming out directly, we must<br>go.”<br><br>“Later... later! Tomorrow. It’s too late...”<br><br>Rostóv turned and was about to go, but the man in the braces stopped<br>him.<br><br>“Whom have you come from? Who are you?”<br><br>“I come from Major Denísov,” answered Rostóv.<br><br>“Are you an officer?”<br><br>“Lieutenant Count Rostóv.”<br><br>“What audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And go along with<br>you... go,” and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed<br>him.<br><br>Rostóv went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were<br>many officers and generals in full parade uniform, whom he had to pass.<br><br>Cursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of finding<br>himself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to<br>shame and arrested in his presence, fully alive now to the impropriety<br>of his conduct and repenting of it, Rostóv, with downcast eyes, was<br>making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a<br>familiar voice called him and a hand detained him.<br><br>“What are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?” asked a deep<br>voice.<br><br>It was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperor’s special favor<br>during this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the division in<br>which Rostóv was serving.<br><br>Rostóv, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the kindly,<br>jocular face of the general, he took him aside and in an excited voice<br>told him the whole affair, asking him to intercede for Denísov, whom<br>the general knew. Having heard Rostóv to the end, the general shook his<br>head gravely.<br><br>“I’m sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the letter.”<br><br>Hardly had Rostóv handed him the letter and finished explaining<br>Denísov’s case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard<br>on the stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the porch. The<br>gentlemen of the Emperor’s suite ran down the stairs and went to their<br>horses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at Austerlitz, led up the<br>Emperor’s horse, and the faint creak of a footstep Rostóv knew at<br>once was heard on the stairs. Forgetting the danger of being recognized,<br>Rostóv went close to the porch, together with some inquisitive<br>civilians, and again, after two years, saw those features he adored:<br>that same face and same look and step, and the same union of majesty and<br>mildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign<br>rose again in Rostóv’s soul in all its old force. In the uniform of<br>the Preobrazhénsk regiment—white chamois-leather breeches and high<br>boots—and wearing a star Rostóv did not know (it was that of the<br>Légion d’honneur), the monarch came out into the porch, putting on<br>his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm. He stopped and looked<br>about him, brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a few<br>words to some of the generals, and, recognizing the former commander of<br>Rostóv’s division, smiled and beckoned to him.<br><br>All the suite drew back and Rostóv saw the general talking for some<br>time to the Emperor.<br><br>The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse.<br>Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers (among whom<br>was Rostóv) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside his horse,<br>with his hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the cavalry general<br>and said in a loud voice, evidently wishing to be heard by all:<br><br>“I cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is stronger than<br>I,” and he raised his foot to the stirrup.<br><br>The general bowed his head respectfully, and the monarch mounted and<br>rode down the street at a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm,<br>Rostóv ran after him with the crowd.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXI<br><br>The Emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, a battalion<br>of the Preobrazhénsk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the<br>French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left.<br><br>As the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which presented<br>arms, another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, and<br>at the head of them Rostóv recognized Napoleon. It could be no one<br>else. He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over<br>a white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder. He was riding<br>a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered<br>saddlecloth. On approaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did<br>so, Rostóv, with his cavalryman’s eye, could not help noticing<br>that Napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions<br>shouted “Hurrah!” and “Vive l’Empereur!” Napoleon said<br>something to Alexander, and both Emperors dismounted and took each<br>other’s hands. Napoleon’s face wore an unpleasant and artificial<br>smile. Alexander was saying something affable to him.<br><br>In spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes’ horses, which<br>were pushing back the crowd, Rostóv kept his eyes on every movement<br>of Alexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise that Alexander<br>treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with<br>the Tsar, as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter<br>to him.<br><br>Alexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their suites, approached<br>the right flank of the Preobrazhénsk battalion and came straight up to<br>the crowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close<br>to the Emperors that Rostóv, standing in the front row, was afraid he<br>might be recognized.<br><br>“Sire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the<br>bravest of your soldiers,” said a sharp, precise voice, articulating<br>every letter.<br><br>This was said by the undersized Napoleon, looking up straight into<br>Alexander’s eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to<br>him and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.<br><br>“To him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war,” added<br>Napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and assurance<br>exasperating to Rostóv, he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn<br>up before him, who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their<br>Emperor.<br><br>“Will Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?” said Alexander<br>and took a few hasty steps toward Prince Kozlóvski, the commander of<br>the battalion.<br><br>Bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand,<br>tore it in doing so, and threw it away. An aide-de-camp behind him<br>rushed forward and picked it up.<br><br>“To whom shall it be given?” the Emperor Alexander asked Kozlóvski,<br>in Russian in a low voice.<br><br>“To whomever Your Majesty commands.”<br><br>The Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing back,<br>remarked:<br><br>“But we must give him an answer.”<br><br>Kozlóvski scanned the ranks resolutely and included Rostóv in his<br>scrutiny.<br><br>“Can it be me?” thought Rostóv.<br><br>“Lázarev!” the colonel called, with a frown, and Lázarev, the<br>first soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.<br><br>“Where are you off to? Stop here!” voices whispered to Lázarev who<br>did not know where to go. Lázarev stopped, casting a sidelong look at<br>his colonel in alarm. His face twitched, as often happens to soldiers<br>called before the ranks.<br><br>Napoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little hand out<br>behind him as if to take something. The members of his suite, guessing<br>at once what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed<br>something from one to another, and a page—the same one Rostóv<br>had seen the previous evening at Borís’—ran forward and, bowing<br>respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a<br>moment, laid in it an Order on a red ribbon. Napoleon, without looking,<br>pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them. Then he<br>approached Lázarev (who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his<br>own monarch), looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what<br>he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally, and the small white<br>hand holding the Order touched one of Lázarev’s buttons. It was as if<br>Napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch<br>that soldier’s breast for the soldier to be forever happy, rewarded,<br>and distinguished from everyone else in the world. Napoleon merely laid<br>the cross on Lázarev’s breast and, dropping his hand, turned toward<br>Alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there. And it<br>really did.<br><br>Officious hands, Russian and French, immediately seized the cross and<br>fastened it to the uniform. Lázarev glanced morosely at the little<br>man with white hands who was doing something to him and, still standing<br>motionless presenting arms, looked again straight into Alexander’s<br>eyes, as if asking whether he should stand there, or go away, or do<br>something else. But receiving no orders, he remained for some time in<br>that rigid position.<br><br>The Emperors remounted and rode away. The Preobrazhénsk battalion,<br>breaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables<br>prepared for them.<br><br>Lázarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers embraced<br>him, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of officers and<br>civilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble of Russian and French<br>voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square.<br>Two officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and happy, passed by<br>Rostóv.<br><br>“What d’you think of the treat? All on silver plate,” one of them<br>was saying. “Have you seen Lázarev?”<br><br>“I have.”<br><br>“Tomorrow, I hear, the Preobrazhénskis will give them a dinner.”<br><br>“Yes, but what luck for Lázarev! Twelve hundred francs’ pension for<br>life.”<br><br>“Here’s a cap, lads!” shouted a Preobrazhénsk soldier, donning a<br>shaggy French cap.<br><br>“It’s a fine thing! First-rate!”<br><br>“Have you heard the password?” asked one Guards’ officer of<br>another. “The day before yesterday it was ‘Napoléon, France,<br>bravoure’; yesterday, ‘Alexandre, Russie, grandeur.’ One day our<br>Emperor gives it and next day Napoleon. Tomorrow our Emperor will send<br>a St. George’s Cross to the bravest of the French Guards. It has to be<br>done. He must respond in kind.”<br><br>Borís, too, with his friend Zhilínski, came to see the Preobrazhénsk<br>banquet. On his way back, he noticed Rostóv standing by the corner of a<br>house.<br><br>“Rostóv! How d’you do? We missed one another,” he said, and could<br>not refrain from asking what was the matter, so strangely dismal and<br>troubled was Rostóv’s face.<br><br>“Nothing, nothing,” replied Rostóv.<br><br>“You’ll call round?”<br><br>“Yes, I will.”<br><br>Rostóv stood at that corner for a long time, watching the feast from a<br>distance. In his mind, a painful process was going on which he could<br>not bring to a conclusion. Terrible doubts rose in his soul. Now he<br>remembered Denísov with his changed expression, his submission, and the<br>whole hospital, with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease. So<br>vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he<br>looked round to see where the smell came from. Next he thought of that<br>self-satisfied Bonaparte, with his small white hand, who was now an<br>Emperor, liked and respected by Alexander. Then why those severed<br>arms and legs and those dead men?... Then again he thought of Lázarev<br>rewarded and Denísov punished and unpardoned. He caught himself<br>harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened.<br><br>The smell of the food the Preobrazhénskis were eating and a sense of<br>hunger recalled him from these reflections; he had to get something to<br>eat before going away. He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning.<br>There he found so many people, among them officers who, like himself,<br>had come in civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in getting a<br>dinner. Two officers of his own division joined him. The conversation<br>naturally turned on the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of<br>the army, were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of<br>Friedland. They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would<br>have been done for, as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition.<br>Nicholas ate and drank (chiefly the latter) in silence. He finished a<br>couple of bottles of wine by himself. The process in his mind went on<br>tormenting him without reaching a conclusion. He feared to give way to<br>his thoughts, yet could not get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the<br>officers’ saying that it was humiliating to look at the French,<br>Rostóv began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to<br>the surprise of the officers:<br><br>“How can you judge what’s best?” he cried, the blood suddenly<br>rushing to his face. “How can you judge the Emperor’s actions? What<br>right have we to argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperor’s aims<br>or his actions!”<br><br>“But I never said a word about the Emperor!” said the officer,<br>justifying himself, and unable to understand Rostóv’s outburst,<br>except on the supposition that he was drunk.<br><br>But Rostóv did not listen to him.<br><br>“We are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more,”<br>he went on. “If we are ordered to die, we must die. If we’re<br>punished, it means that we have deserved it, it’s not for us to judge.<br>If the Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude<br>an alliance with him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If<br>once we begin judging and arguing about everything, nothing sacred<br>will be left! That way we shall be saying there is no God—nothing!”<br>shouted Nicholas, banging the table—very little to the point as it<br>seemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own<br>thoughts.<br><br>“Our business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! That’s<br>all....” said he.<br><br>“And to drink,” said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.<br><br>“Yes, and to drink,” assented Nicholas. “Hullo there! Another<br>bottle!” he shouted.<br><br>In 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with<br>the Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was<br>much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXII<br><br>In 1809 the intimacy between “the world’s two arbiters,” as<br>Napoleon and Alexander were called, was such that when Napoleon declared<br>war on Austria a Russian corps crossed the frontier to co-operate with<br>our old enemy Bonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of Austria, and<br>in court circles the possibility of marriage between Napoleon and one<br>of Alexander’s sisters was spoken of. But besides considerations of<br>foreign policy, the attention of Russian society was at that time keenly<br>directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the<br>departments of government.<br><br>Life meanwhile—real life, with its essential interests of health and<br>sickness, toil and rest, and its intellectual interests in thought,<br>science, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, and passions—went on<br>as usual, independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity<br>with Napoleon Bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK SIX: 1808 - 10<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>Prince Andrew had spent two years continuously in the country.<br><br>All the plans Pierre had attempted on his estates—and constantly<br>changing from one thing to another had never accomplished—were carried<br>out by Prince Andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty.<br><br>He had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre lacked,<br>and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going.<br><br>On one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became<br>free agricultural laborers—this being one of the first examples of<br>the kind in Russia. On other estates the serfs’ compulsory labor was<br>commuted for a quitrent. A trained midwife was engaged for Boguchárovo<br>at his expense, and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to<br>the children of the peasants and household serfs.<br><br>Prince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father and his<br>son, who was still in the care of nurses. The other half he spent in<br>“Boguchárovo Cloister,” as his father called Prince Andrew’s<br>estate. Despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had<br>expressed to Pierre, he diligently followed all that went on, received<br>many books, and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had<br>visitors from Petersburg, the very vortex of life, these people lagged<br>behind himself—who never left the country—in knowledge of what was<br>happening in home and foreign affairs.<br><br>Besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of<br>books, Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of<br>our last two unfortunate campaigns, and with drawing up a proposal for a<br>reform of the army rules and regulations.<br><br>In the spring of 1809 he went to visit the Ryazán estates which had<br>been inherited by his son, whose guardian he was.<br><br>Warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the calèche looking at the new<br>grass, the first leaves on the birches, and the first puffs of white<br>spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky. He was not thinking of<br>anything, but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from side to side.<br><br>They crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year before.<br>They went through the muddy village, past threshing floors and green<br>fields of winter rye, downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge,<br>uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain, past strips of<br>stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there, and into a<br>birch forest growing on both sides of the road. In the forest it was<br>almost hot, no wind could be felt. The birches with their sticky green<br>leaves were motionless, and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades<br>of green grass were pushing up and lifting last year’s leaves. The<br>coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there<br>among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter. On entering the<br>forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly.<br><br>Peter the footman made some remark to the coachman; the latter assented.<br>But apparently the coachman’s sympathy was not enough for Peter, and<br>he turned on the box toward his master.<br><br>“How pleasant it is, your excellency!” he said with a respectful<br>smile.<br><br>“What?”<br><br>“It’s pleasant, your excellency!”<br><br>“What is he talking about?” thought Prince Andrew. “Oh, the<br>spring, I suppose,” he thought as he turned round. “Yes, really<br>everything is green already.... How early! The birches and cherry and<br>alders too are coming out.... But the oaks show no sign yet. Ah, here is<br>one oak!”<br><br>At the edge of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times the age of the<br>birches that formed the forest, it was ten times as thick and twice as<br>tall as they. It was an enormous tree, its girth twice as great as a<br>man could embrace, and evidently long ago some of its branches had been<br>broken off and its bark scarred. With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling<br>unsymmetrically, and its gnarled hands and fingers, it stood an aged,<br>stern, and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees. Only the<br>dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak,<br>refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or<br>the sunshine.<br><br>“Spring, love, happiness!” this oak seemed to say. “Are you not<br>weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always the<br>same and always a fraud? There is no spring, no sun, no happiness! Look<br>at those cramped dead firs, ever the same, and at me too, sticking out<br>my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown, whether from my<br>back or my sides: as they have grown so I stand, and I do not believe in<br>your hopes and your lies.”<br><br>As he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times to<br>look at that oak, as if expecting something from it. Under the oak,<br>too, were flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling, rigid,<br>misshapen, and grim as ever.<br><br>“Yes, the oak is right, a thousand times right,” thought Prince<br>Andrew. “Let others—the young—yield afresh to that fraud, but we<br>know life, our life is finished!”<br><br>A whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but mournfully pleasant, rose<br>in his soul in connection with that tree. During this journey he, as<br>it were, considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion,<br>restful in its hopelessness: that it was not for him to begin anything<br>anew—but that he must live out his life, content to do no harm, and<br>not disturbing himself or desiring anything.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>Prince Andrew had to see the Marshal of the Nobility for the district<br>in connection with the affairs of the Ryazán estate of which he was<br>trustee. This Marshal was Count Ilyá Rostóv, and in the middle of May<br>Prince Andrew went to visit him.<br><br>It was now hot spring weather. The whole forest was already clothed in<br>green. It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to<br>bathe.<br><br>Prince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied with the business about which<br>he had to speak to the Marshal, was driving up the avenue in the grounds<br>of the Rostóvs’ house at Otrádnoe. He heard merry girlish cries<br>behind some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross<br>the path of his calèche. Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a<br>dark-haired, remarkably slim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress, with<br>a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair<br>escaped. The girl was shouting something but, seeing that he was a<br>stranger, ran back laughing without looking at him.<br><br>Suddenly, he did not know why, he felt a pang. The day was so beautiful,<br>the sun so bright, everything around so gay, but that slim pretty girl<br>did not know, or wish to know, of his existence and was contented and<br>cheerful in her own separate—probably foolish—but bright and happy<br>life. “What is she so glad about? What is she thinking of? Not of<br>the military regulations or of the arrangement of the Ryazán serfs’<br>quitrents. Of what is she thinking? Why is she so happy?” Prince<br>Andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity.<br><br>In 1809 Count Ilyá Rostóv was living at Otrádnoe just as he had done<br>in former years, that is, entertaining almost the whole province with<br>hunts, theatricals, dinners, and music. He was glad to see Prince<br>Andrew, as he was to see any new visitor, and insisted on his staying<br>the night.<br><br>During the dull day, in the course of which he was entertained by<br>his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors (the old<br>count’s house was crowded on account of an approaching name day),<br>Prince Andrew repeatedly glanced at Natásha, gay and laughing among the<br>younger members of the company, and asked himself each time, “What is<br>she thinking about? Why is she so glad?”<br><br>That night, alone in new surroundings, he was long unable to sleep. He<br>read awhile and then put out his candle, but relit it. It was hot in the<br>room, the inside shutters of which were closed. He was cross with the<br>stupid old man (as he called Rostóv), who had made him stay by assuring<br>him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town, and he<br>was vexed with himself for having stayed.<br><br>He got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he opened the<br>shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for this, burst<br>into the room. He opened the casement. The night was fresh, bright, and<br>very still. Just before the window was a row of pollard trees, looking<br>black on one side and with a silvery light on the other. Beneath the<br>trees grew some kind of lush, wet, bushy vegetation with silver-lit<br>leaves and stems here and there. Farther back beyond the dark trees a<br>roof glittered with dew, to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly<br>white trunk and branches, and above it shone the moon, nearly at its<br>full, in a pale, almost starless, spring sky. Prince Andrew leaned his<br>elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky.<br><br>His room was on the first floor. Those in the rooms above were also<br>awake. He heard female voices overhead.<br><br>“Just once more,” said a girlish voice above him which Prince Andrew<br>recognized at once.<br><br>“But when are you coming to bed?” replied another voice.<br><br>“I won’t, I can’t sleep, what’s the use? Come now for the last<br>time.”<br><br>Two girlish voices sang a musical passage—the end of some song.<br><br>“Oh, how lovely! Now go to sleep, and there’s an end of it.”<br><br>“You go to sleep, but I can’t,” said the first voice, coming<br>nearer to the window. She was evidently leaning right out, for the<br>rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard. Everything<br>was stone-still, like the moon and its light and the shadows. Prince<br>Andrew, too, dared not stir, for fear of betraying his unintentional<br>presence.<br><br>“Sónya! Sónya!” he again heard the first speaker. “Oh, how can<br>you sleep? Only look how glorious it is! Ah, how glorious! Do wake up,<br>Sónya!” she said almost with tears in her voice. “There never,<br>never was such a lovely night before!”<br><br>Sónya made some reluctant reply.<br><br>“Do just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how lovely! Come here....<br>Darling, sweetheart, come here! There, you see? I feel like sitting down<br>on my heels, putting my arms round my knees like this, straining tight,<br>as tight as possible, and flying away! Like this....”<br><br>“Take care, you’ll fall out.”<br><br>He heard the sound of a scuffle and Sónya’s disapproving voice:<br>“It’s past one o’clock.”<br><br>“Oh, you only spoil things for me. All right, go, go!”<br><br>Again all was silent, but Prince Andrew knew she was still sitting<br>there. From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh.<br><br>“O God, O God! What does it mean?” she suddenly exclaimed. “To bed<br>then, if it must be!” and she slammed the casement.<br><br>“For her I might as well not exist!” thought Prince Andrew while he<br>listened to her voice, for some reason expecting yet fearing that she<br>might say something about him. “There she is again! As if it were on<br>purpose,” thought he.<br><br>In his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful<br>thoughts and hopes, contrary to the whole tenor of his life, that unable<br>to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>Next morning, having taken leave of no one but the count, and not<br>waiting for the ladies to appear, Prince Andrew set off for home.<br><br>It was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he drove<br>into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and<br>memorable an impression on him. In the forest the harness bells sounded<br>yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, for now all was<br>thick, shady, and dense, and the young firs dotted about in the forest<br>did not jar on the general beauty but, lending themselves to the mood<br>around, were delicately green with fluffy young shoots.<br><br>The whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but only<br>a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling the road<br>and the sappy leaves. The left side of the forest was dark in the shade,<br>the right side glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny and scarcely<br>swayed by the breeze. Everything was in blossom, the nightingales<br>trilled, and their voices reverberated now near, now far away.<br><br>“Yes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed,” thought<br>Prince Andrew. “But where is it?” he again wondered, gazing at<br>the left side of the road, and without recognizing it he looked with<br>admiration at the very oak he sought. The old oak, quite transfigured,<br>spreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage, stood rapt and<br>slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun. Neither gnarled<br>fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in<br>evidence now. Through the hard century-old bark, even where there were<br>no twigs, leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old<br>veteran could have produced.<br><br>“Yes, it is the same oak,” thought Prince Andrew, and all at once he<br>was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal. All<br>the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory. Austerlitz<br>with the lofty heavens, his wife’s dead reproachful face, Pierre at<br>the ferry, that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night, and that night<br>itself and the moon, and... all this rushed suddenly to his mind.<br><br>“No, life is not over at thirty-one!” Prince Andrew suddenly decided<br>finally and decisively. “It is not enough for me to know what I have<br>in me—everyone must know it: Pierre, and that young girl who wanted to<br>fly away into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life may not be<br>lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it, but so that<br>it may be reflected in them all, and they and I may live in harmony!”<br><br><br>On reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that autumn<br>and found all sorts of reasons for this decision. A whole series of<br>sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him<br>to go to Petersburg, and even to re-enter the service, kept springing<br>up in his mind. He could not now understand how he could ever even have<br>doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life, just as a month<br>before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country<br>could ever enter his head. It now seemed clear to him that all his<br>experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to<br>some kind of work and again played an active part in life. He did not<br>even remember how formerly, on the strength of similar wretched logical<br>arguments, it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if<br>he now, after the lessons he had had in life, allowed himself to believe<br>in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness<br>or love. Now reason suggested quite the opposite. After that journey<br>to Ryazán he found the country dull; his former pursuits no longer<br>interested him, and often when sitting alone in his study he got up,<br>went to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his own face. Then he would<br>turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise, who with hair curled à la<br>grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame. She<br>did not now say those former terrible words to him, but looked simply,<br>merrily, and inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrew, crossing his<br>arms behind him, long paced the room, now frowning, now smiling, as<br>he reflected on those irrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as a<br>crime, which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre, with<br>fame, with the girl at the window, the oak, and woman’s beauty<br>and love. And if anyone came into his room at such moments he was<br>particularly cold, stern, and above all unpleasantly logical.<br><br>“My dear,” Princess Mary entering at such a moment would say,<br>“little Nicholas can’t go out today, it’s very cold.”<br><br>“If it were hot,” Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly<br>to his sister, “he could go out in his smock, but as it is cold he<br>must wear warm clothes, which were designed for that purpose. That is<br>what follows from the fact that it is cold; and not that a child who<br>needs fresh air should remain at home,” he would add with extreme<br>logic, as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that<br>stirred within him.<br><br>At such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work dries<br>men up.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>Prince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August, 1809. It was the time<br>when the youthful Speránski was at the zenith of his fame and his<br>reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy. That same<br>August the Emperor was thrown from his calèche, injured his leg, and<br>remained three weeks at Peterhof, receiving Speránski every day and no<br>one else. At that time the two famous decrees were being prepared<br>that so agitated society—abolishing court ranks and introducing<br>examinations to qualify for the grades of Collegiate Assessor and<br>State Councilor—and not merely these but a whole state constitution,<br>intended to change the existing order of government in Russia: legal,<br>administrative, and financial, from the Council of State down to the<br>district tribunals. Now those vague liberal dreams with which the<br>Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne, and which he had tried to put<br>into effect with the aid of his associates, Czartorýski, Novosíltsev,<br>Kochubéy, and Strógonov—whom he himself in jest had called his<br>Comité de salut public—were taking shape and being realized.<br><br>Now all these men were replaced by Speránski on the civil side, and<br>Arakchéev on the military. Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew, as a<br>gentleman of the chamber, presented himself at court and at a levee. The<br>Emperor, though he met him twice, did not favor him with a single word.<br>It had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he was antipathetic<br>to the Emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality<br>generally, and in the cold, repellent glance the Emperor gave him, he<br>now found further confirmation of this surmise. The courtiers explained<br>the Emperor’s neglect of him by His Majesty’s displeasure at<br>Bolkónski’s not having served since 1805.<br><br>“I know myself that one cannot help one’s sympathies and<br>antipathies,” thought Prince Andrew, “so it will not do to present<br>my proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the Emperor<br>personally, but the project will speak for itself.”<br><br>He mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal, a friend<br>of his father’s. The field marshal made an appointment to see him,<br>received him graciously, and promised to inform the Emperor. A few<br>days later Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see the<br>Minister of War, Count Arakchéev.<br><br><br>On the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakchéev’s waiting<br>room at nine in the morning.<br><br>He did not know Arakchéev personally, had never seen him, and all he<br>had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man.<br><br>“He is Minister of War, a man trusted by the Emperor, and I need not<br>concern myself about his personal qualities: he has been commissioned to<br>consider my project, so he alone can get it adopted,” thought Prince<br>Andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people<br>in Count Arakchéev’s waiting room.<br><br>During his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew had seen the<br>anterooms of many important men, and the different types of such rooms<br>were well known to him. Count Arakchéev’s anteroom had quite a<br>special character. The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their<br>turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility; the faces of<br>those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness, covered<br>by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves, their situation, and<br>the person for whom they were waiting. Some walked thoughtfully up and<br>down, others whispered and laughed. Prince Andrew heard the nickname<br>“Síla Andréevich” and the words, “Uncle will give it to us<br>hot,” in reference to Count Arakchéev. One general (an important<br>personage), evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long, sat<br>crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself.<br><br>But the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all<br>faces—that of fear. Prince Andrew for the second time asked the<br>adjutant on duty to take in his name, but received an ironical look and<br>was told that his turn would come in due course. After some others had<br>been shown in and out of the minister’s room by the adjutant on duty,<br>an officer who struck Prince Andrew by his humiliated and frightened air<br>was admitted at that terrible door. This officer’s audience lasted a<br>long time. Then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard<br>from the other side of the door, and the officer—with pale face and<br>trembling lips—came out and passed through the waiting room, clutching<br>his head.<br><br>After this Prince Andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on<br>duty said in a whisper, “To the right, at the window.”<br><br>Prince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of<br>forty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, deep wrinkles,<br>scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an overhanging red<br>nose. Arakchéev turned his head toward him without looking at him.<br><br>“What is your petition?” asked Arakchéev.<br><br>“I am not petitioning, your excellency,” returned Prince Andrew<br>quietly.<br><br>Arakchéev’s eyes turned toward him.<br><br>“Sit down,” said he. “Prince Bolkónski?”<br><br>“I am not petitioning about anything. His Majesty the Emperor has<br>deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me...”<br><br>“You see, my dear sir, I have read your project,” interrupted<br>Arakchéev, uttering only the first words amiably and then—again<br>without looking at Prince Andrew—relapsing gradually into a tone of<br>grumbling contempt. “You are proposing new military laws? There are<br>many laws but no one to carry out the old ones. Nowadays everybody<br>designs laws, it is easier writing than doing.”<br><br>“I came at His Majesty the Emperor’s wish to learn from your<br>excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have<br>presented,” said Prince Andrew politely.<br><br>“I have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the<br>committee. I do not approve of it,” said Arakchéev, rising and taking<br>a paper from his writing table. “Here!” and he handed it to Prince<br>Andrew.<br><br>Across the paper was scrawled in pencil, without capital letters,<br>misspelled, and without punctuation: “Unsoundly constructed because<br>resembles an imitation of the French military code and from the Articles<br>of War needlessly deviating.”<br><br>“To what committee has the memorandum been referred?” inquired<br>Prince Andrew.<br><br>“To the Committee on Army Regulations, and I have recommended that<br>your honor should be appointed a member, but without a salary.”<br><br>Prince Andrew smiled.<br><br>“I don’t want one.”<br><br>“A member without salary,” repeated Arakchéev. “I have the<br>honor... Eh! Call the next one! Who else is there?” he shouted, bowing<br>to Prince Andrew.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>While waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee<br>Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances, particularly those he<br>knew to be in power and whose aid he might need. In Petersburg he now<br>experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle, when<br>troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling<br>circles where the future, on which the fate of millions depended, was<br>being shaped. From the irritation of the older men, the curiosity of the<br>uninitiated, the reserve of the initiated, the hurry and preoccupation<br>of everyone, and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose<br>existence he learned every day, he felt that now, in 1809, here in<br>Petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation, the commander in<br>chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know, but who was<br>supposed to be a man of genius—Speránski. And this movement of<br>reconstruction of which Prince Andrew had a vague idea, and Speránski<br>its chief promoter, began to interest him so keenly that the question<br>of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his<br>consciousness.<br><br>Prince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the<br>highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. The reforming<br>party cordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place because<br>he was reputed to be clever and very well read, and secondly because by<br>liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal.<br>The party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured the innovations,<br>turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the<br>reforms, simply because he was the son of his father. The feminine<br>society world welcomed him gladly, because he was rich, distinguished, a<br>good match, and almost a newcomer, with a halo of romance on account<br>of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife. Besides this<br>the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had<br>greatly improved during these last five years, having softened and grown<br>more manly, lost his former affectation, pride, and contemptuous irony,<br>and acquired the serenity that comes with years. People talked about<br>him, were interested in him, and wanted to meet him.<br><br>The day after his interview with Count Arakchéev, Prince Andrew spent<br>the evening at Count Kochubéy’s. He told the count of his interview<br>with Síla Andréevich (Kochubéy spoke of Arakchéev by that nickname<br>with the same vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed in the Minister of<br>War’s anteroom).<br><br>“Mon cher, even in this case you can’t do without Michael<br>Mikháylovich Speránski. He manages everything. I’ll speak to him. He<br>has promised to come this evening.”<br><br>“What has Speránski to do with the army regulations?” asked Prince<br>Andrew.<br><br>Kochubéy shook his head smilingly, as if surprised at Bolkónski’s<br>simplicity.<br><br>“We were talking to him about you a few days ago,” Kochubéy<br>continued, “and about your freed plowmen.”<br><br>“Oh, is it you, Prince, who have freed your serfs?” said an old man<br>of Catherine’s day, turning contemptuously toward Bolkónski.<br><br>“It was a small estate that brought in no profit,” replied Prince<br>Andrew, trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man<br>uselessly.<br><br>“Afraid of being late...” said the old man, looking at Kochubéy.<br><br>“There’s one thing I don’t understand,” he continued. “Who<br>will plow the land if they are set free? It is easy to write laws, but<br>difficult to rule.... Just the same as now—I ask you, Count—who will<br>be heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations?”<br><br>“Those who pass the examinations, I suppose,” replied Kochubéy,<br>crossing his legs and glancing round.<br><br>“Well, I have Pryánichnikov serving under me, a splendid man, a<br>priceless man, but he’s sixty. Is he to go up for examination?”<br><br>“Yes, that’s a difficulty, as education is not at all general,<br>but...”<br><br>Count Kochubéy did not finish. He rose, took Prince Andrew by the arm,<br>and went to meet a tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a large open<br>forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness, who was<br>just entering. The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with a<br>cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast. It was<br>Speránski. Prince Andrew recognized him at once, and felt a throb<br>within him, as happens at critical moments of life. Whether it was from<br>respect, envy, or anticipation, he did not know. Speránski’s whole<br>figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable. In<br>the society in which Prince Andrew lived he had never seen anyone who<br>together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and<br>self-assurance; he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression<br>as that in those half-closed, rather humid eyes, or so firm a smile that<br>expressed nothing; nor had he heard such a refined, smooth, soft<br>voice; above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or<br>hands—hands which were broad, but very plump, soft, and white. Such<br>whiteness and softness Prince Andrew had only seen on the faces of<br>soldiers who had been long in hospital. This was Speránski, Secretary<br>of State, reporter to the Emperor and his companion at Erfurt, where he<br>had more than once met and talked with Napoleon.<br><br>Speránski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people<br>involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to<br>speak. He spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be listened to, and<br>he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing.<br><br>Prince Andrew followed Speránski’s every word and movement with<br>particular attention. As happens to some people, especially to men<br>who judge those near to them severely, he always on meeting<br>anyone new—especially anyone whom, like Speránski, he knew by<br>reputation—expected to discover in him the perfection of human<br>qualities.<br><br>Speránski told Kochubéy he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner<br>as he had been detained at the palace. He did not say that the Emperor<br>had kept him, and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation of modesty.<br>When Kochubéy introduced Prince Andrew, Speránski slowly turned<br>his eyes to Bolkónski with his customary smile and looked at him in<br>silence.<br><br>“I am very glad to make your acquaintance. I had heard of you, as<br>everyone has,” he said after a pause.<br><br>Kochubéy said a few words about the reception Arakchéev had given<br>Bolkónski. Speránski smiled more markedly.<br><br>“The chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is my good friend<br>Monsieur Magnítski,” he said, fully articulating every word and<br>syllable, “and if you like I can put you in touch with him.” He<br>paused at the full stop. “I hope you will find him sympathetic and<br>ready to co-operate in promoting all that is reasonable.”<br><br>A circle soon formed round Speránski, and the old man who had talked<br>about his subordinate Pryánichnikov addressed a question to him.<br><br>Prince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement<br>of Speránski’s: this man, not long since an insignificant divinity<br>student, who now, Bolkónski thought, held in his hands—those plump<br>white hands—the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the<br>extraordinarily disdainful composure with which Speránski answered<br>the old man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from<br>an immeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud,<br>Speránski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or<br>disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign.<br><br>Having talked for a little while in the general circle, Speránski rose<br>and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the<br>room. It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in<br>Bolkónski.<br><br>“I had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated<br>conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me,” he said<br>with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he<br>and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom<br>he had just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrew. “I have known<br>of you for a long time: first from your action with regard to your<br>serfs, a first example, of which it is very desirable that there should<br>be more imitators; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen<br>of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new<br>decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so<br>much gossip and tittle-tattle.”<br><br>“No,” said Prince Andrew, “my father did not wish me to take<br>advantage of the privilege. I began the service from the lower grade.”<br><br>“Your father, a man of the last century, evidently stands above our<br>contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely re-establishes<br>natural justice.”<br><br>“I think, however, that these condemnations have some ground,”<br>returned Prince Andrew, trying to resist Speránski’s influence, of<br>which he began to be conscious. He did not like to agree with him in<br>everything and felt a wish to contradict. Though he usually spoke easily<br>and well, he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking<br>with Speránski. He was too much absorbed in observing the famous<br>man’s personality.<br><br>“Grounds of personal ambition maybe,” Speránski put in quietly.<br><br>“And of state interest to some extent,” said Prince Andrew.<br><br>“What do you mean?” asked Speránski quietly, lowering his eyes.<br><br>“I am an admirer of Montesquieu,” replied Prince Andrew, “and<br>his idea that le principe des monarchies est l’honneur me paraît<br>incontestable. Certains droits et privilèges de la noblesse me<br>paraissent être des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment.” *<br><br>     * “The principle of monarchies is honor seems to me<br>     incontestable. Certain rights and privileges for the<br>     aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that<br>     sentiment.”<br><br><br>The smile vanished from Speránski’s white face, which was much<br>improved by the change. Probably Prince Andrew’s thought interested<br>him.<br><br>“Si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue,” * he began,<br>pronouncing French with evident difficulty, and speaking even slower<br>than in Russian but quite calmly.<br><br>    * “If you regard the question from that point of view.”<br><br><br>Speránski went on to say that honor, l’honneur, cannot be upheld by<br>privileges harmful to the service; that honor, l’honneur, is either a<br>negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of<br>emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards, which recognize it.<br>His arguments were concise, simple, and clear.<br><br>“An institution upholding honor, the source of emulation, is one<br>similar to the Légion d’honneur of the great Emperor Napoleon, not<br>harmful but helpful to the success of the service, but not a class or<br>court privilege.”<br><br>“I do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that court privileges<br>have attained the same end,” returned Prince Andrew. “Every courtier<br>considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily.”<br><br>“Yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, Prince,”<br>said Speránski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably<br>an argument which was embarrassing for his companion. “If you will<br>do me the honor of calling on me on Wednesday,” he added, “I will,<br>after talking with Magnítski, let you know what may interest you, and<br>shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you.”<br><br>Closing his eyes, he bowed à la française, without taking leave, and<br>trying to attract as little attention as possible, he left the room.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>During the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew felt the<br>whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite<br>overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city.<br><br>On returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four<br>or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours. The mechanism<br>of life, the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere,<br>absorbed the greater part of his vital energy. He did nothing, did<br>not even think or find time to think, but only talked, and talked<br>successfully, of what he had thought while in the country.<br><br>He sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same<br>remark on the same day in different circles. But he was so busy for<br>whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking<br>of nothing.<br><br>As he had done on their first meeting at Kochubéy’s, Speránski<br>produced a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, when he<br>received him tête-à-tête at his own house and talked to him long and<br>confidentially.<br><br>To Bolkónski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant<br>creatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that<br>perfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed that in<br>Speránski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous<br>man. Had Speránski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed<br>the same breeding and traditions, Bolkónski would soon have discovered<br>his weak, human, unheroic sides; but as it was, Speránski’s strange<br>and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because<br>he did not quite understand him. Moreover, Speránski, either because he<br>appreciated the other’s capacity or because he considered it necessary<br>to win him to his side, showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness<br>before Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which<br>goes hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption<br>that one’s companion is the only man besides oneself capable of<br>understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness<br>and profundity of one’s own ideas.<br><br>During their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Speránski more<br>than once remarked: “We regard everything that is above the common<br>level of rooted custom...” or, with a smile: “But we want the wolves<br>to be fed and the sheep to be safe...” or: “They cannot understand<br>this...” and all in a way that seemed to say: “We, you and I,<br>understand what they are and who we are.”<br><br>This first long conversation with Speránski only strengthened in Prince<br>Andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting.<br>He saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking man of vast intellect who by<br>his energy and persistence had attained power, which he was using solely<br>for the welfare of Russia. In Prince Andrew’s eyes Speránski was the<br>man he would himself have wished to be—one who explained all the facts<br>of life reasonably, considered important only what was rational, and<br>was capable of applying the standard of reason to everything. Everything<br>seemed so simple and clear in Speránski’s exposition that Prince<br>Andrew involuntarily agreed with him about everything. If he replied and<br>argued, it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and<br>not submit to Speránski’s opinions entirely. Everything was right<br>and everything was as it should be: only one thing disconcerted Prince<br>Andrew. This was Speránski’s cold, mirrorlike look, which did not<br>allow one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white hands, which<br>Prince Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of<br>those who possess power. This mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands<br>irritated Prince Andrew, he knew not why. He was unpleasantly<br>struck, too, by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in<br>Speránski, and by the diversity of lines of argument he used to<br>support his opinions. He made use of every kind of mental device, except<br>analogy, and passed too boldly, it seemed to Prince Andrew, from one<br>to another. Now he would take up the position of a practical man and<br>condemn dreamers; now that of a satirist, and laugh ironically at his<br>opponents; now grow severely logical, or suddenly rise to the realm of<br>metaphysics. (This last resource was one he very frequently employed.)<br>He would transfer a question to metaphysical heights, pass on to<br>definitions of space, time, and thought, and, having deduced the<br>refutation he needed, would again descend to the level of the original<br>discussion.<br><br>In general the trait of Speránski’s mentality which struck Prince<br>Andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and<br>authority of reason. It was evident that the thought could never occur<br>to him which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that it is<br>after all impossible to express all one thinks; and that he had never<br>felt the doubt, “Is not all I think and believe nonsense?” And<br>it was just this peculiarity of Speránski’s mind that particularly<br>attracted Prince Andrew.<br><br>During the first period of their acquaintance Bolkónski felt a<br>passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for<br>Bonaparte. The fact that Speránski was the son of a village priest,<br>and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his<br>humble origin (as in fact many did), caused Prince Andrew to cherish his<br>sentiment for him the more, and unconsciously to strengthen it.<br><br>On that first evening Bolkónski spent with him, having mentioned the<br>Commission for the Revision of the Code of Laws, Speránski told him<br>sarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and fifty<br>years, had cost millions, and had done nothing except that Rosenkampf<br>had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes.<br><br>“And that is all the state has for the millions it has spent,” said<br>he. “We want to give the Senate new juridical powers, but we have no<br>laws. That is why it is a sin for men like you, Prince, not to serve in<br>these times!”<br><br>Prince Andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was<br>needed which he did not possess.<br><br>“But nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious<br>circle from which we must break a way out.”<br><br>A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army<br>Regulations and—what he had not at all expected—was chairman of a<br>section of the committee for the revision of the laws. At Speránski’s<br>request he took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up<br>and, with the aid of the Code Napoléon and the Institutes of Justinian,<br>he worked at formulating the section on Personal Rights.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>Nearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning to Petersburg<br>after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading<br>position among the Petersburg Freemasons. He arranged dining and funeral<br>lodge meetings, enrolled new members, and busied himself uniting various<br>lodges and acquiring authentic charters. He gave money for the erection<br>of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms,<br>in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular.<br>He supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in<br>Petersburg.<br><br>His life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations and<br>dissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he considered<br>it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the<br>bachelor circles in which he moved.<br><br>Amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre at<br>the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest<br>upon it, the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him.<br>At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the<br>closer bound he involuntarily became to the order. When he had joined<br>the Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently<br>steps onto the smooth surface of a bog. When he put his foot down it<br>sank in. To make quite sure of the firmness of the ground, he put<br>his other foot down and sank deeper still, became stuck in it, and<br>involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog.<br><br>Joseph Alexéevich was not in Petersburg—he had of late stood aside<br>from the affairs of the Petersburg lodges, and lived almost entirely in<br>Moscow. All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew in ordinary<br>life, and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as Brothers in<br>Freemasonry and not as Prince B. or Iván Vasílevich D., whom he knew<br>in society mostly as weak and insignificant men. Under the Masonic<br>aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they<br>aimed in ordinary life. Often after collecting alms, and reckoning up<br>twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a<br>dozen members, of whom half were as well able to pay as himself, Pierre<br>remembered the Masonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote<br>all his belongings to his neighbor, and doubts on which he tried not to<br>dwell arose in his soul.<br><br>He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. In the first he<br>put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges<br>or in human affairs, but were exclusively occupied with the mystical<br>science of the order: with questions of the threefold designation of<br>God, the three primordial elements—sulphur, mercury, and salt—or<br>the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of<br>Solomon. Pierre respected this class of Brothers to which the elder ones<br>chiefly belonged, including, Pierre thought, Joseph Alexéevich himself,<br>but he did not share their interests. His heart was not in the mystical<br>aspect of Freemasonry.<br><br>In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him,<br>seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight<br>and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.<br><br>In the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) who saw<br>nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, and prized<br>the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their<br>purport or significance. Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master<br>of the principal lodge.<br><br>Finally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged,<br>particularly those who had lately joined. These according to Pierre’s<br>observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for<br>anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy<br>young Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank,<br>and of whom there were very many in the lodge.<br><br>Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. Freemasonry,<br>at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely<br>on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but<br>suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated<br>from its original principles. And so toward the end of the year he went<br>abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order.<br><br>In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg. Our Freemasons knew<br>from correspondence with those abroad that Bezúkhov had obtained the<br>confidence of many highly placed persons, had been initiated into many<br>mysteries, had been raised to a higher grade, and was bringing back with<br>him much that might conduce to the advantage of the Masonic cause<br>in Russia. The Petersburg Freemasons all came to see him, tried to<br>ingratiate themselves with him, and it seemed to them all that he was<br>preparing something for them and concealing it.<br><br>A solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened, at<br>which Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers what<br>he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order. The<br>meeting was a full one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre rose and began<br>his address.<br><br>“Dear Brothers,” he began, blushing and stammering, with a written<br>speech in his hand, “it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in<br>the seclusion of our lodge—we must act—act! We are drowsing, but we<br>must act.” Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.<br><br>“For the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of<br>virtue,” he read, “we must cleanse men from prejudice, diffuse<br>principles in harmony with the spirit of the times, undertake the<br>education of the young, unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the<br>wisest men, boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions, infidelity, and<br>folly, and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity<br>of purpose and possessed of authority and power.<br><br>“To attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice<br>and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may, even in this world,<br>receive a lasting reward for his virtue. But in these great endeavors we<br>are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today. What is<br>to be done in these circumstances? To favor revolutions, overthrow<br>everything, repel force by force?... No! We are very far from that.<br>Every violent reform deserves censure, for it quite fails to remedy<br>evil while men remain what they are, and also because wisdom needs no<br>violence.<br><br>“The whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of<br>preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of<br>conviction—aiming at the punishment of vice and folly, and patronizing<br>talent and virtue: raising worthy men from the dust and attaching<br>them to our Brotherhood. Only then will our order have the power<br>unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder and to<br>control them without their being aware of it. In a word, we must found a<br>form of government holding universal sway, which should be diffused over<br>the whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship, and beside<br>which all other governments can continue in their customary course and<br>do everything except what impedes the great aim of our order, which<br>is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice. This aim was that of<br>Christianity itself. It taught men to be wise and good and for their<br>own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest<br>men.<br><br>“At that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, preaching<br>alone was of course sufficient. The novelty of Truth endowed her with<br>special strength, but now we need much more powerful methods. It is<br>now necessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in virtue<br>a charm palpable to those senses. It is impossible to eradicate the<br>passions; but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim, and it is<br>therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions<br>within the limits of virtue. Our order should provide means to that end.<br><br>“As soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state,<br>each of them again training two others and all being closely united,<br>everything will be possible for our order, which has already in secret<br>accomplished much for the welfare of mankind.”<br><br>This speech not only made a strong impression, but created excitement in<br>the lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing in it dangerous designs<br>of Illuminism, * met it with a coldness that surprised Pierre. The Grand<br>Master began answering him, and Pierre began developing his views with<br>more and more warmth. It was long since there had been so stormy a<br>meeting. Parties were formed, some accusing Pierre of Illuminism, others<br>supporting him. At that meeting he was struck for the first time by<br>the endless variety of men’s minds, which prevents a truth from ever<br>presenting itself identically to two persons. Even those members<br>who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with<br>limitations and alterations he could not agree to, as what he always<br>wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself<br>understood it.<br><br>     * The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for<br>     monarchical institutions.<br><br>At the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will<br>reproved Bezúkhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue<br>alone, but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute.<br>Pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would<br>be accepted. He was told that it would not, and without waiting for the<br>usual formalities he left the lodge and went home.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>Again Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded. For three<br>days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at<br>home receiving no one and going nowhere.<br><br>It was just then that he received a letter from his wife, who implored<br>him to see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and how she<br>wished to devote her whole life to him.<br><br>At the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would<br>return to Petersburg from abroad.<br><br>Following this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre respected<br>less than the others forced his way in to see him and, turning the<br>conversation upon Pierre’s matrimonial affairs, by way of fraternal<br>advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong<br>and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of Freemasonry by not<br>forgiving the penitent.<br><br>At the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vasíli’s wife, sent to<br>him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most<br>important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and<br>that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then<br>was, this was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him.<br>Nothing in life seemed to him of much importance, and under the<br>influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his<br>liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife.<br><br>“No one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to<br>blame,” he thought.<br><br>If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it<br>was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take<br>any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away.<br>Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of indifference<br>whether he lived with his wife or not?<br><br>Without replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre late<br>one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph<br>Alexéevich. This is what he noted in his diary:<br><br>Moscow, 17th November<br><br>I have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I<br>have experienced. Joseph Alexéevich is living poorly and has for three<br>years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has<br>ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint. From morning till<br>late at night, except when he eats his very plain food, he is working<br>at science. He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed<br>on which he lay. I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of<br>Jerusalem, and he responded in the same manner, asking me with a mild<br>smile what I had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges.<br>I told him everything as best I could, and told him what I had proposed<br>to our Petersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, and of<br>my rupture with the Brothers. Joseph Alexéevich, having remained silent<br>and thoughtful for a good while, told me his view of the matter, which<br>at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow.<br>He surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of<br>the order: (1) The preservation and study of the mystery. (2) The<br>purification and reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The<br>improvement of the human race by striving for such purification. Which<br>is the principal aim of these three? Certainly self-reformation and<br>self-purification. Only to this aim can we always strive independently<br>of circumstances. But at the same time just this aim demands the<br>greatest efforts of us; and so, led astray by pride, losing sight of<br>this aim, we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our<br>impurity we are unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation of<br>the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and<br>profligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because it is<br>attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground<br>Joseph Alexéevich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the<br>depth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs he said<br>to me, “the chief duty of a true Mason, as I have told you, lies in<br>perfecting himself. We often think that by removing all the difficulties<br>of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim, but on the contrary,<br>my dear sir, it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain<br>our three chief aims: (1) Self-knowledge—for man can only know himself<br>by comparison, (2) Self-perfecting, which can only be attained by<br>conflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief virtue—love of death.<br>Only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our<br>innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life.” These words are all<br>the more remarkable because, in spite of his great physical sufferings,<br>Joseph Alexéevich is never weary of life though he loves death, for<br>which—in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man—he does<br>not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared. My benefactor then explained<br>to me fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out<br>to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything. He<br>advised me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but<br>to take up only second-grade posts in the lodge, to try, while<br>diverting the Brothers from pride, to turn them toward the true path<br>self-knowledge and self-perfecting. Besides this he advised me for<br>myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself, and to that end<br>he gave me a notebook, the one I am now writing in and in which I will<br>in future note down all my actions.<br><br>Petersburg, 23rd November<br><br>I am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me in tears and<br>said that Hélène was here and that she implored me to hear her; that<br>she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more. I knew<br>that if I once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on<br>refusing what she wanted. In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and<br>advice to seek. Had my benefactor been here he would have told me what<br>to do. I went to my room and reread Joseph Alexéevich’s letters and<br>recalled my conversations with him, and deduced from it all that I<br>ought not to refuse a supplicant, and ought to reach a helping hand to<br>everyone—especially to one so closely bound to me—and that I must<br>bear my cross. But if I forgive her for the sake of doing right, then<br>let union with her have only a spiritual aim. That is what I decided,<br>and what I wrote to Joseph Alexéevich. I told my wife that I begged her<br>to forget the past, to forgive me whatever wrong I may have done her,<br>and that I had nothing to forgive. It gave me joy to tell her this. She<br>need not know how hard it was for me to see her again. I have settled on<br>the upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of<br>regeneration.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>At that time, as always happens, the highest society that met at court<br>and at the grand balls was divided into several circles, each with its<br>own particular tone. The largest of these was the French circle of the<br>Napoleonic alliance, the circle of Count Rumyántsev and Caulaincourt.<br>In this group Hélène, as soon as she had settled in Petersburg with<br>her husband, took a very prominent place. She was visited by the members<br>of the French embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for<br>their intellect and polished manners.<br><br>Hélène had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the Emperors<br>and had brought from there these connections with the Napoleonic<br>notabilities. At Erfurt her success had been brilliant. Napoleon himself<br>had noticed her in the theater and said of her: “C’est un superbe<br>animal.” * Her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not<br>surprise Pierre, for she had become even handsomer than before. What did<br>surprise him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded<br>in gaining the reputation “d’ une femme charmante, aussi spirituelle<br>que belle.” *(2) The distinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her<br>eight-page letters. Bilíbin saved up his epigrams to produce them<br>in Countess Bezúkhova’s presence. To be received in the Countess<br>Bezúkhova’s salon was regarded as a diploma of intellect. Young men<br>read books before attending Hélène’s evenings, to have something to<br>say in her salon, and secretaries of the embassy, and even ambassadors,<br>confided diplomatic secrets to her, so that in a way Hélène was a<br>power. Pierre, who knew she was very stupid, sometimes attended, with a<br>strange feeling of perplexity and fear, her evenings and dinner parties,<br>where politics, poetry, and philosophy were discussed. At these parties<br>his feelings were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick<br>to be found out at any moment. But whether because stupidity was just<br>what was needed to run such a salon, or because those who were deceived<br>found pleasure in the deception, at any rate it remained unexposed and<br>Hélène Bezúkhova’s reputation as a lovely and clever woman became<br>so firmly established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest<br>things and everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers<br>and look for a profound meaning in it of which she herself had no<br>conception.<br><br>     * “That’s a superb animal.”<br><br>     * (2) “Of a charming woman, as witty as she is lovely.”<br><br><br>Pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman. He was<br>that absent-minded crank, a grand seigneur husband who was in no one’s<br>way, and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the<br>drawing room, he served, by the contrast he presented to her, as an<br>advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife. Pierre during<br>the last two years, as a result of his continual absorption in abstract<br>interests and his sincere contempt for all else, had acquired in his<br>wife’s circle, which did not interest him, that air of unconcern,<br>indifference, and benevolence toward all, which cannot be acquired<br>artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect. He entered<br>his wife’s drawing room as one enters a theater, was acquainted with<br>everybody, equally pleased to see everyone, and equally indifferent to<br>them all. Sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him<br>and, regardless of whether any “gentlemen of the embassy” were<br>present or not, lispingly expressed his views, which were sometimes not<br>at all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment. But the general<br>opinion concerning the queer husband of “the most distinguished woman<br>in Petersburg” was so well established that no one took his freaks<br>seriously.<br><br>Among the many young men who frequented her house every day, Borís<br>Drubetskóy, who had already achieved great success in the service, was<br>the most intimate friend of the Bezúkhov household since Hélène’s<br>return from Erfurt. Hélène spoke of him as “mon page” and treated<br>him like a child. Her smile for him was the same as for everybody,<br>but sometimes that smile made Pierre uncomfortable. Toward him Borís<br>behaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference. This shade<br>of deference also disturbed Pierre. He had suffered so painfully three<br>years before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected him<br>that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition, first<br>by not being a husband to his wife, and secondly by not allowing himself<br>to suspect.<br><br>“No, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced<br>her former infatuations,” he told himself. “There has never been<br>an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the<br>heart”—a statement which, though gathered from an unknown source,<br>he believed implicitly. Yet strange to say Borís’ presence in his<br>wife’s drawing room (and he was almost always there) had a physical<br>effect upon Pierre; it constricted his limbs and destroyed the<br>unconsciousness and freedom of his movements.<br><br>“What a strange antipathy,” thought Pierre, “yet I used to like<br>him very much.”<br><br>In the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the rather blind<br>and absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank who did<br>nothing but harmed nobody and was a first-rate, good-natured fellow. But<br>a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place<br>all this time in Pierre’s soul, revealing much to him and causing him<br>many spiritual doubts and joys.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>Pierre went on with his diary, and this is what he wrote in it during<br>that time:<br><br><br>24th November<br><br>Got up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went to my duties. (By Joseph<br>Alexéevich’s advice Pierre had entered the service of the state and<br>served on one of the committees.) Returned home for dinner and dined<br>alone—the countess had many visitors I do not like. I ate and drank<br>moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers.<br>In the evening I went down to the countess and told a funny story about<br>B., and only remembered that I ought not to have done so when everybody<br>laughed loudly at it.<br><br>I am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind. Great God, help me to<br>walk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation,<br>(2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion, (3) to withdraw<br>from worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service of the state, (b) family<br>duties, (c) relations with my friends, and the management of my affairs.<br><br><br>27th November<br><br>I got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God,<br>help and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the Scriptures,<br>but without proper feeling. Brother Urúsov came and we talked about<br>worldly vanities. He told me of the Emperor’s new projects. I began<br>to criticize them, but remembered my rules and my benefactor’s<br>words—that a true Freemason should be a zealous worker for the state<br>when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to<br>assist. My tongue is my enemy. Brothers G. V. and O. visited me and we<br>had a preliminary talk about the reception of a new Brother. They laid<br>on me the duty of Rhetor. I feel myself weak and unworthy. Then our<br>talk turned to the interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the<br>Temple, the seven sciences, the seven virtues, the seven vices, and the<br>seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. Brother O. was very eloquent. In the<br>evening the admission took place. The new decoration of the Premises<br>contributed much to the magnificence of the spectacle. It was Borís<br>Drubetskóy who was admitted. I nominated him and was the Rhetor. A<br>strange feeling agitated me all the time I was alone with him in the<br>dark chamber. I caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him<br>which I vainly tried to overcome. That is why I should really like<br>to save him from evil and lead him into the path of truth, but evil<br>thoughts of him did not leave me. It seemed to me that his object in<br>entering the Brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with<br>members of our lodge. Apart from the fact that he had asked me several<br>times whether N. and S. were members of our lodge (a question to which I<br>could not reply) and that according to my observation he is incapable of<br>feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied<br>with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement, I had no cause to<br>doubt him, but he seemed to me insincere, and all the time I stood<br>alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me that he was smiling<br>contemptuously at my words, and I wished really to stab his bare breast<br>with the sword I held to it. I could not be eloquent, nor could I<br>frankly mention my doubts to the Brothers and to the Grand Master. Great<br>Architect of Nature, help me to find the true path out of the labyrinth<br>of lies!<br><br><br>After this, three pages were left blank in the diary, and then the<br>following was written:<br><br><br>I have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother V., who<br>advised me to hold fast by Brother A. Though I am unworthy, much was<br>revealed to me. Adonai is the name of the creator of the world. Elohim<br>is the name of the ruler of all. The third name is the name unutterable<br>which means the All. Talks with Brother V. strengthen, refresh, and<br>support me in the path of virtue. In his presence doubt has no place.<br>The distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our<br>sacred all-embracing teaching is clear to me. Human sciences dissect<br>everything to comprehend it, and kill everything to examine it. In the<br>holy science of our order all is one, all is known in its entirety and<br>life. The Trinity—the three elements of matter—are sulphur, mercury,<br>and salt. Sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature; in combination with<br>salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means<br>of which it attracts mercury, seizes it, holds it, and in combination<br>produces other bodies. Mercury is a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence.<br>Christ, the Holy Spirit, Him!...<br><br><br>3rd December<br><br>Awoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic. Afterwards went and<br>paced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, but instead my<br>imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago, when Dólokhov,<br>meeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I was enjoying<br>perfect peace of mind in spite of my wife’s absence. At the time I<br>gave him no answer. Now I recalled every detail of that meeting and in<br>my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies. I recollected<br>myself and drove away that thought only when I found myself glowing with<br>anger, but I did not sufficiently repent. Afterwards Borís Drubetskóy<br>came and began relating various adventures. His coming vexed me from the<br>first, and I said something disagreeable to him. He replied. I flared<br>up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him. He became<br>silent, and I recollected myself only when it was too late. My God, I<br>cannot get on with him at all. The cause of this is my egotism. I set<br>myself above him and so become much worse than he, for he is lenient<br>to my rudeness while I on the contrary nourish contempt for him. O God,<br>grant that in his presence I may rather see my own vileness, and behave<br>so that he too may benefit. After dinner I fell asleep and as I was<br>drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear, “Thy<br>day!”<br><br>I dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by<br>dogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left<br>thigh with its teeth and would not let go. I began to throttle it with<br>my hands. Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger one, began<br>biting me. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted it the bigger and<br>heavier it grew. And suddenly Brother A. came and, taking my arm, led<br>me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank.<br>I stepped on it, but it bent and gave way and I began to clamber up a<br>fence which I could scarcely reach with my hands. After much effort I<br>dragged myself up, so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on<br>the other. I looked round and saw Brother A. standing on the fence and<br>pointing me to a broad avenue and garden, and in the garden was a large<br>and beautiful building. I woke up. O Lord, great Architect of Nature,<br>help me to tear from myself these dogs—my passions especially the<br>last, which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones, and<br>aid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which I attained in<br>my dream.<br><br><br>7th December<br><br>I dreamed that Joseph Alexéevich was sitting in my house, and that I<br>was very glad and wished to entertain him. It seemed as if I chattered<br>incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could<br>not please him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace him. But<br>as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young,<br>and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order,<br>but so softly that I could not hear it. Then it seemed that we all left<br>the room and something strange happened. We were sitting or lying on<br>the floor. He was telling me something, and I wished to show him my<br>sensibility, and not listening to what he was saying I began picturing<br>to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of God sanctifying<br>me. And tears came into my eyes, and I was glad he noticed this. But he<br>looked at me with vexation and jumped up, breaking off his remarks. I<br>felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern<br>me; but he did not reply, gave me a kind look, and then we suddenly<br>found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed. He lay down<br>on the edge of it and I burned with longing to caress him and lie down<br>too. And he said, “Tell me frankly what is your chief temptation? Do<br>you know it? I think you know it already.” Abashed by this question,<br>I replied that sloth was my chief temptation. He shook his head<br>incredulously; and even more abashed, I said that though I was living<br>with my wife as he advised, I was not living with her as her husband. To<br>this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of one’s embraces<br>and gave me to understand that that was my duty. But I replied that<br>I should be ashamed to do it, and suddenly everything vanished. And I<br>awoke and found in my mind the text from the Gospel: “The life was<br>the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness<br>comprehended it not.” Joseph Alexéevich’s face had looked young<br>and bright. That day I received a letter from my benefactor in which he<br>wrote about “conjugal duties.”<br><br><br>9th December<br><br>I had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart. I saw that<br>I was in Moscow in my house, in the big sitting room, and Joseph<br>Alexéevich came in from the drawing room. I seemed to know at once that<br>the process of regeneration had already taken place in him, and I rushed<br>to meet him. I embraced him and kissed his hands, and he said, “Hast<br>thou noticed that my face is different?” I looked at him, still<br>holding him in my arms, and saw that his face was young, but that he<br>had no hair on his head and his features were quite changed. And I said,<br>“I should have known you had I met you by chance,” and I thought to<br>myself, “Am I telling the truth?” And suddenly I saw him lying like<br>a dead body; then he gradually recovered and went with me into my study<br>carrying a large book of sheets of drawing paper; I said, “I drew<br>that,” and he answered by bowing his head. I opened the book, and on<br>all the pages there were excellent drawings. And in my dream I knew<br>that these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its<br>beloved. And on its pages I saw a beautiful representation of a maiden<br>in transparent garments and with a transparent body, flying up to the<br>clouds. And I seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a<br>representation of the Song of Songs. And looking at those drawings I<br>dreamed I felt that I was doing wrong, but could not tear myself away<br>from them. Lord, help me! My God, if Thy forsaking me is Thy doing, Thy<br>will be done; but if I am myself the cause, teach me what I should do! I<br>shall perish of my debauchery if Thou utterly desertest me!<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>The Rostóvs’ monetary affairs had not improved during the two years<br>they had spent in the country.<br><br>Though Nicholas Rostóv had kept firmly to his resolution and was still<br>serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little,<br>the way of life at Otrádnoe—Mítenka’s management of affairs, in<br>particular—was such that the debts inevitably increased every year.<br>The only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to<br>apply for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one<br>and also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last<br>time.<br><br>Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to Véra and was<br>accepted.<br><br>Though in Moscow the Rostóvs belonged to the best society without<br>themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of<br>acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were<br>provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without<br>inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them.<br><br>The Rostóvs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in<br>Moscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country<br>neighbors from Otrádnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters,<br>Perónskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bezúkhov, and the son of their<br>district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the<br>men who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rostóvs’ house in<br>Petersburg were Borís, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and<br>dragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the Rostóvs’<br>and paid the eldest daughter, Countess Véra, the attentions a young man<br>pays when he intends to propose.<br><br>Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at<br>Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He<br>narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that<br>everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he had<br>obtained two decorations for Austerlitz.<br><br>In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had picked<br>up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near<br>the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander. Just as he had<br>done after Austerlitz, he related this occurrence at such length and<br>so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do<br>this, and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also. In<br>1809 he was a captain in the Guards, wore medals, and held some special<br>lucrative posts in Petersburg.<br><br>Though some skeptics smiled when told of Berg’s merits, it could not<br>be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent<br>terms with his superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant career<br>before him and an assured position in society.<br><br>Four years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow<br>theater, Berg had pointed out Véra Rostóva to him and had said in<br>German, “das soll mein Weib werden,” * and from that moment had<br>made up his mind to marry her. Now in Petersburg, having considered the<br>Rostóvs’ position and his own, he decided that the time had come to<br>propose.<br><br>    * “That girl shall be my wife.”<br><br><br>Berg’s proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not<br>flattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure<br>Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess Rostóva; but<br>Berg’s chief characteristic was such a naïve and good natured egotism<br>that the Rostóvs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing,<br>since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good, indeed<br>excellent. Moreover, the Rostóvs’ affairs were seriously embarrassed,<br>as the suitor could not but know; and above all, Véra was twenty-four,<br>had been taken out everywhere, and though she was certainly good-looking<br>and sensible, no one up to now had proposed to her. So they gave their<br>consent.<br><br>“You see,” said Berg to his comrade, whom he called “friend”<br>only because he knew that everyone has friends, “you see, I have<br>considered it all, and should not marry if I had not thought it all out<br>or if it were in any way unsuitable. But on the contrary, my papa and<br>mamma are now provided for—I have arranged that rent for them in the<br>Baltic Provinces—and I can live in Petersburg on my pay, and with<br>her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely. I am not<br>marrying for money—I consider that dishonorable—but a wife should<br>bring her share and a husband his. I have my position in the service,<br>she has connections and some means. In our times that is worth<br>something, isn’t it? But above all, she is a handsome, estimable girl,<br>and she loves me....”<br><br>Berg blushed and smiled.<br><br>“And I love her, because her character is sensible and very good.<br>Now the other sister, though they are the same family, is quite<br>different—an unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence.<br>She is so... you know?... Unpleasant... But my fiancée!... Well, you<br>will be coming,” he was going to say, “to dine,” but changed his<br>mind and said “to take tea with us,” and quickly doubling up his<br>tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke, perfectly embodying<br>his dream of happiness.<br><br>After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Berg’s<br>proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took<br>possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and insincere.<br>In the family’s feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness<br>and constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not having loved<br>Véra sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands. The<br>old count felt this most. He would probably have been unable to state<br>the cause of his embarrassment, but it resulted from the state of his<br>affairs. He did not know at all how much he had, what his debts amounted<br>to, or what dowry he could give Véra. When his daughters were born<br>he had assigned to each of them, for her dowry, an estate with three<br>hundred serfs; but one of these estates had already been sold, and the<br>other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would<br>have to be sold, so that it was impossible to give it to Véra. Nor had<br>he any money.<br><br>Berg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained before<br>the wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the<br>question of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. At one time the<br>count thought of giving her the Ryazán estate or of selling a forest,<br>at another time of borrowing money on a note of hand. A few days before<br>the wedding Berg entered the count’s study early one morning and, with<br>a pleasant smile, respectfully asked his future father-in-law to let<br>him know what Véra’s dowry would be. The count was so disconcerted by<br>this long-foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first<br>reply that came into his head. “I like your being businesslike about<br>it.... I like it. You shall be satisfied....”<br><br>And patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end the<br>conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did not<br>know for certain how much Véra would have and did not receive at least<br>part of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters off.<br><br>“Because, consider, Count—if I allowed myself to marry now<br>without having definite means to maintain my wife, I should be acting<br>badly....”<br><br>The conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous and to<br>avoid further importunity, saying that he would give a note of hand<br>for eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on the<br>shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that it was impossible<br>for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in<br>ready money. “Or at least twenty thousand, Count,” he added, “and<br>then a note of hand for only sixty thousand.”<br><br>“Yes, yes, all right!” said the count hurriedly. “Only excuse me,<br>my dear fellow, I’ll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for<br>eighty thousand as well. Yes, yes! Kiss me.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>Natásha was sixteen and it was the year 1809, the very year to which<br>she had counted on her fingers with Borís after they had kissed four<br>years ago. Since then she had not seen him. Before Sónya and her<br>mother, if Borís happened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of<br>that episode as of some childish, long-forgotten matter that was not<br>worth mentioning. But in the secret depths of her soul the question<br>whether her engagement to Borís was a jest or an important, binding<br>promise tormented her.<br><br>Since Borís left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the<br>Rostóvs. He had been in Moscow several times, and had passed near<br>Otrádnoe, but had never been to see them.<br><br>Sometimes it occurred to Natásha that he did not wish to see her, and<br>this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke<br>of him.<br><br>“Nowadays old friends are not remembered,” the countess would say<br>when Borís was mentioned.<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna also had of late visited them less frequently, seemed<br>to hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke rapturously<br>and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on<br>which he had entered. When the Rostóvs came to Petersburg Borís called<br>on them.<br><br>He drove to their house in some agitation. The memory of Natásha was<br>his most poetic recollection. But he went with the firm intention of<br>letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between<br>himself and Natásha could not be binding either on her or on him. He<br>had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess<br>Bezúkhova, a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage<br>of an important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed, and he<br>was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in<br>Petersburg, plans which might very easily be realized. When he entered<br>the Rostóvs’ drawing room Natásha was in her own room. When she<br>heard of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room, flushed and<br>beaming with a more than cordial smile.<br><br>Borís remembered Natásha in a short dress, with dark eyes shining from<br>under her curls and boisterous, childish laughter, as he had known her<br>four years before; and so he was taken aback when quite a different<br>Natásha entered, and his face expressed rapturous astonishment. This<br>expression on his face pleased Natásha.<br><br>“Well, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?” asked the<br>countess.<br><br>Borís kissed Natásha’s hand and said that he was astonished at the<br>change in her.<br><br>“How handsome you have grown!”<br><br>“I should think so!” replied Natásha’s laughing eyes.<br><br>“And is Papa older?” she asked.<br><br>Natásha sat down and, without joining in Borís’ conversation with<br>the countess, silently and minutely studied her childhood’s suitor. He<br>felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced<br>at her occasionally.<br><br>Borís’ uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were all<br>comme il faut and in the latest fashion. This Natásha noticed at once.<br>He sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess, arranging<br>with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand<br>like a skin, and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his<br>lips about the amusements of the highest Petersburg society, recalling<br>with mild irony old times in Moscow and Moscow acquaintances. It was<br>not accidentally, Natásha felt, that he alluded, when speaking of the<br>highest aristocracy, to an ambassador’s ball he had attended, and to<br>invitations he had received from N.N. and S.S.<br><br>All this time Natásha sat silent, glancing up at him from under her<br>brows. This gaze disturbed and confused Borís more and more. He looked<br>round more frequently toward her, and broke off in what he was saying.<br>He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave. The<br>same inquisitive, challenging, and rather mocking eyes still looked<br>at him. After his first visit Borís said to himself that Natásha<br>attracted him just as much as ever, but that he must not yield to that<br>feeling, because to marry her, a girl almost without fortune, would<br>mean ruin to his career, while to renew their former relations without<br>intending to marry her would be dishonorable. Borís made up his mind<br>to avoid meeting Natásha, but despite that resolution he called again<br>a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the<br>Rostóvs’. It seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with<br>Natásha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten, that in<br>spite of everything... she could not be his wife, that he had no means,<br>and they would never let her marry him. But he failed to do so and felt<br>awkward about entering on such an explanation. From day to day he<br>became more and more entangled. It seemed to her mother and Sónya that<br>Natásha was in love with Borís as of old. She sang him his favorite<br>songs, showed him her album, making him write in it, did not allow him<br>to allude to the past, letting it be understood how delightful was the<br>present; and every day he went away in a fog, without having said what<br>he meant to, and not knowing what he was doing or why he came, or how<br>it would all end. He left off visiting Hélène and received reproachful<br>notes from her every day, and yet he continued to spend whole days with<br>the Rostóvs.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>One night when the old countess, in nightcap and dressing jacket,<br>without her false curls, and with her poor little knob of hair showing<br>under her white cotton cap, knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and<br>bowing to the ground in prayer, her door creaked and Natásha, also in<br>a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in<br>curlpapers, ran in. The countess—her prayerful mood dispelled—looked<br>round and frowned. She was finishing her last prayer: “Can it be that<br>this couch will be my grave?” Natásha, flushed and eager, seeing<br>her mother in prayer, suddenly checked her rush, half sat down, and<br>unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself. Seeing that<br>her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and, rapidly<br>slipping one little foot against the other, pushed off her slippers and<br>jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave. This<br>couch was high, with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than<br>the one below. Natásha jumped on it, sank into the feather bed, rolled<br>over to the wall, and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled<br>down, raising her knees to her chin, kicking out and laughing almost<br>inaudibly, now covering herself up head and all, and now peeping at her<br>mother. The countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a<br>stern face, but seeing, that Natásha’s head was covered, she smiled<br>in her kind, weak way.<br><br>“Now then, now then!” said she.<br><br>“Mamma, can we have a talk? Yes?” said Natásha. “Now, just one on<br>your throat and another... that’ll do!” And seizing her mother round<br>the neck, she kissed her on the throat. In her behavior to her mother<br>Natásha seemed rough, but she was so sensitive and tactful that however<br>she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her<br>or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased.<br><br>“Well, what is it tonight?” said the mother, having arranged her<br>pillows and waited until Natásha, after turning over a couple of times,<br>had settled down beside her under the quilt, spread out her arms, and<br>assumed a serious expression.<br><br>These visits of Natásha’s at night before the count returned from his<br>club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother, and daughter.<br><br>“What is it tonight?—But I have to tell you...”<br><br>Natásha put her hand on her mother’s mouth.<br><br>“About Borís... I know,” she said seriously; “that’s what I<br>have come about. Don’t say it—I know. No, do tell me!” and she<br>removed her hand. “Tell me, Mamma! He’s nice?”<br><br>“Natásha, you are sixteen. At your age I was married. You say Borís<br>is nice. He is very nice, and I love him like a son. But what then?...<br>What are you thinking about? You have quite turned his head, I can see<br>that....”<br><br>As she said this the countess looked round at her daughter. Natásha<br>was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany<br>sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead, so that the countess<br>only saw her daughter’s face in profile. That face struck her by its<br>peculiarly serious and concentrated expression.<br><br>Natásha was listening and considering.<br><br>“Well, what then?” said she.<br><br>“You have quite turned his head, and why? What do you want of him? You<br>know you can’t marry him.”<br><br>“Why not?” said Natásha, without changing her position.<br><br>“Because he is young, because he is poor, because he is a relation...<br>and because you yourself don’t love him.”<br><br>“How do you know?”<br><br>“I know. It is not right, darling!”<br><br>“But if I want to...” said Natásha.<br><br>“Leave off talking nonsense,” said the countess.<br><br>“But if I want to...”<br><br>“Natásha, I am in earnest...”<br><br>Natásha did not let her finish. She drew the countess’ large hand to<br>her, kissed it on the back and then on the palm, then again turned it<br>over and began kissing first one knuckle, then the space between the<br>knuckles, then the next knuckle, whispering, “January, February,<br>March, April, May. Speak, Mamma, why don’t you say anything? Speak!”<br>said she, turning to her mother, who was tenderly gazing at her daughter<br>and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to<br>say.<br><br>“It won’t do, my love! Not everyone will understand this friendship<br>dating from your childish days, and to see him so intimate with you may<br>injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us, and above all<br>it torments him for nothing. He may already have found a suitable and<br>wealthy match, and now he’s half crazy.”<br><br>“Crazy?” repeated Natásha.<br><br>“I’ll tell you some things about myself. I had a cousin...”<br><br>“I know! Cyril Matvéich... but he is old.”<br><br>“He was not always old. But this is what I’ll do, Natásha, I’ll<br>have a talk with Borís. He need not come so often....”<br><br>“Why not, if he likes to?”<br><br>“Because I know it will end in nothing....”<br><br>“How can you know? No, Mamma, don’t speak to him! What nonsense!”<br>said Natásha in the tone of one being deprived of her property.<br>“Well, I won’t marry, but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy<br>it.” Natásha smiled and looked at her mother. “Not to marry, but<br>just so,” she added.<br><br>“How so, my pet?”<br><br>“Just so. There’s no need for me to marry him. But... just so.”<br><br>“Just so, just so,” repeated the countess, and shaking all over, she<br>went off into a good humored, unexpected, elderly laugh.<br><br>“Don’t laugh, stop!” cried Natásha. “You’re shaking the whole<br>bed! You’re awfully like me, just such another giggler.... Wait...”<br>and she seized the countess’ hands and kissed a knuckle of the little<br>finger, saying, “June,” and continued, kissing, “July, August,”<br>on the other hand. “But, Mamma, is he very much in love? What do you<br>think? Was anybody ever so much in love with you? And he’s very nice,<br>very, very nice. Only not quite my taste—he is so narrow, like the<br>dining-room clock.... Don’t you understand? Narrow, you know—gray,<br>light gray...”<br><br>“What rubbish you’re talking!” said the countess.<br><br>Natásha continued: “Don’t you really understand? Nicholas would<br>understand.... Bezúkhov, now, is blue, dark-blue and red, and he is<br>square.”<br><br>“You flirt with him too,” said the countess, laughing.<br><br>“No, he is a Freemason, I have found out. He is fine, dark-blue and<br>red.... How can I explain it to you?”<br><br>“Little countess!” the count’s voice called from behind the door.<br>“You’re not asleep?” Natásha jumped up, snatched up her slippers,<br>and ran barefoot to her own room.<br><br>It was a long time before she could sleep. She kept thinking that no one<br>could understand all that she understood and all there was in her.<br><br>“Sónya?” she thought, glancing at that curled-up, sleeping little<br>kitten with her enormous plait of hair. “No, how could she? She’s<br>virtuous. She fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know<br>anything more. Even Mamma does not understand. It is wonderful how<br>clever I am and how... charming she is,” she went on, speaking<br>of herself in the third person, and imagining it was some very wise<br>man—the wisest and best of men—who was saying it of her. “There<br>is everything, everything in her,” continued this man. “She is<br>unusually intelligent, charming... and then she is pretty, uncommonly<br>pretty, and agile—she swims and rides splendidly... and her voice! One<br>can really say it’s a wonderful voice!”<br><br>She hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by Cherubini, threw herself<br>on her bed, laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately<br>fall asleep, called Dunyásha the maid to put out the candle, and before<br>Dunyásha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier<br>world of dreams, where everything was as light and beautiful as in<br>reality, and even more so because it was different.<br><br>Next day the countess called Borís aside and had a talk with him, after<br>which he ceased coming to the Rostóvs’.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>On the thirty-first of December, New Year’s Eve, 1809 - 10 an old<br>grandee of Catherine’s day was giving a ball and midnight supper. The<br>diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present.<br><br>The grandee’s well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered with<br>innumerable lights. Police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance<br>which was carpeted with red baize, and not only gendarmes but dozens of<br>police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch.<br>Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving, with red-liveried<br>footmen and footmen in plumed hats. From the carriages emerged men<br>wearing uniforms, stars, and ribbons, while ladies in satin and ermine<br>cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them<br>with a clatter, and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize<br>at the entrance.<br><br>Almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the<br>crowd and caps were doffed.<br><br>“The Emperor?... No, a minister... prince... ambassador. Don’t you<br>see the plumes?...” was whispered among the crowd.<br><br>One person, better dressed than the rest, seemed to know everyone and<br>mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day.<br><br>A third of the visitors had already arrived, but the Rostóvs, who were<br>to be present, were still hurrying to get dressed.<br><br>There had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the<br>Rostóv family, many fears that the invitation would not arrive, that<br>the dresses would not be ready, or that something would not be arranged<br>as it should be.<br><br>Márya Ignátevna Perónskaya, a thin and shallow maid of honor at<br>the court of the Dowager Empress, who was a friend and relation of the<br>countess and piloted the provincial Rostóvs in Petersburg high society,<br>was to accompany them to the ball.<br><br>They were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten<br>o’clock, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were<br>not yet dressed.<br><br>Natásha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up at eight that<br>morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day. All<br>her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they<br>all—she herself, Mamma, and Sónya—should be as well dressed as<br>possible. Sónya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands.<br>The countess was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress, and the two<br>girls white gauze over pink silk slips, with roses on their bodices and<br>their hair dressed à la grecque.<br><br>Everything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks, and<br>ears washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the openwork<br>silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on; the<br>hairdressing was almost done. Sónya was finishing dressing and so was<br>the countess, but Natásha, who had bustled about helping them all, was<br>behindhand. She was still sitting before a looking-glass with a dressing<br>jacket thrown over her slender shoulders. Sónya stood ready dressed in<br>the middle of the room and, pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her<br>dainty finger, was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went<br>through it.<br><br>“That’s not the way, that’s not the way, Sónya!” cried Natásha<br>turning her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the<br>maid who was dressing it had not time to release. “That bow is not<br>right. Come here!”<br><br>Sónya sat down and Natásha pinned the ribbon on differently.<br><br>“Allow me, Miss! I can’t do it like that,” said the maid who was<br>holding Natásha’s hair.<br><br>“Oh, dear! Well then, wait. That’s right, Sónya.”<br><br>“Aren’t you ready? It is nearly ten,” came the countess’ voice.<br><br>“Directly! Directly! And you, Mamma?”<br><br>“I have only my cap to pin on.”<br><br>“Don’t do it without me!” called Natásha. “You won’t do it<br>right.”<br><br>“But it’s already ten.”<br><br>They had decided to be at the ball by half-past ten, and Natásha had<br>still to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens.<br><br>When her hair was done, Natásha, in her short petticoat from under<br>which her dancing shoes showed, and in her mother’s dressing jacket,<br>ran up to Sónya, scrutinized her, and then ran to her mother. Turning<br>her mother’s head this way and that, she fastened on the cap and,<br>hurriedly kissing her gray hair, ran back to the maids who were turning<br>up the hem of her skirt.<br><br>The cause of the delay was Natásha’s skirt, which was too long.<br>Two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of<br>thread. A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the<br>countess and Sónya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment<br>up high on one uplifted hand.<br><br>“Mávra, quicker, darling!”<br><br>“Give me my thimble, Miss, from there...”<br><br>“Whenever will you be ready?” asked the count coming to the door.<br>“Here is some scent. Perónskaya must be tired of waiting.”<br><br>“It’s ready, Miss,” said the maid, holding up the shortened gauze<br>dress with two fingers, and blowing and shaking something off it, as if<br>by this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what<br>she held.<br><br>Natásha began putting on the dress.<br><br>“In a minute! In a minute! Don’t come in, Papa!” she cried to her<br>father as he opened the door—speaking from under the filmy skirt which<br>still covered her whole face.<br><br>Sónya slammed the door to. A minute later they let the count in. He was<br>wearing a blue swallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, and was perfumed<br>and his hair pomaded.<br><br>“Oh, Papa! how nice you look! Charming!” cried Natásha, as she<br>stood in the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze.<br><br>“If you please, Miss! allow me,” said the maid, who on her knees was<br>pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her<br>mouth to the other with her tongue.<br><br>“Say what you like,” exclaimed Sónya, in a despairing voice as she<br>looked at Natásha, “say what you like, it’s still too long.”<br><br>Natásha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass. The dress<br>was too long.<br><br>“Really, madam, it is not at all too long,” said Mávra, crawling on<br>her knees after her young lady.<br><br>“Well, if it’s too long we’ll tack it up... we’ll tack it up<br>in one minute,” said the resolute Dunyásha taking a needle that was<br>stuck on the front of her little shawl and, still kneeling on the floor,<br>set to work once more.<br><br>At that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shyly, in her cap<br>and velvet gown.<br><br>“Oo-oo, my beauty!” exclaimed the count, “she looks better than<br>any of you!”<br><br>He would have embraced her but, blushing, she stepped aside fearing to<br>be rumpled.<br><br>“Mamma, your cap, more to this side,” said Natásha. “I’ll<br>arrange it,” and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking<br>up her skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn<br>off.<br><br>“Oh goodness! What has happened? Really it was not my fault!”<br><br>“Never mind, I’ll run it up, it won’t show,” said Dunyásha.<br><br>“What a beauty—a very queen!” said the nurse as she came to the<br>door. “And Sónya! They are lovely!”<br><br>At a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started.<br>But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.<br><br>Perónskaya was quite ready. In spite of her age and plainness she<br>had gone through the same process as the Rostóvs, but with less<br>flurry—for to her it was a matter of routine. Her ugly old body was<br>washed, perfumed, and powdered in just the same way. She had washed<br>behind her ears just as carefully, and when she entered her drawing<br>room in her yellow dress, wearing her badge as maid of honor, her old<br>lady’s maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the Rostóvs’<br>servants had been.<br><br>She praised the Rostóvs’ toilets. They praised her taste and toilet,<br>and at eleven o’clock, careful of their coiffures and dresses, they<br>settled themselves in their carriages and drove off.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>Natásha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once<br>had time to think of what lay before her.<br><br>In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage, she<br>for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at<br>the ball, in those brightly lighted rooms—with music, flowers, dances,<br>the Emperor, and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg. The<br>prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true,<br>so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the<br>carriage. She understood all that awaited her only when, after stepping<br>over the red baize at the entrance, she entered the hall, took off her<br>fur cloak, and, beside Sónya and in front of her mother, mounted the<br>brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers. Only then did she<br>remember how she must behave at a ball, and tried to assume the majestic<br>air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion. But,<br>fortunately for her, she felt her eyes growing misty, she saw nothing<br>clearly, her pulse beat a hundred to the minute, and the blood throbbed<br>at her heart. She could not assume that pose, which would have made her<br>ridiculous, and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying<br>with all her might to conceal it. And this was the very attitude that<br>became her best. Before and behind them other visitors were entering,<br>also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses. The mirrors on the<br>landing reflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, with<br>diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms.<br><br>Natásha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection<br>from the others. All was blended into one brilliant procession.<br>On entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices, footsteps, and<br>greetings deafened Natásha, and the light and glitter dazzled her still<br>more. The host and hostess, who had already been standing at the door<br>for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals,<br>“Charmé de vous voir,” * greeted the Rostóvs and Perónskaya in<br>the same manner.<br><br>    * “Delighted to see you.”<br><br><br>The two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her<br>black hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostess’ eye<br>involuntarily rested longer on the slim Natásha. She looked at her<br>and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as<br>hostess. Looking at her she may have recalled the golden, irrecoverable<br>days of her own girlhood and her own first ball. The host also followed<br>Natásha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter.<br><br>“Charming!” said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.<br><br>In the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting<br>the Emperor. The countess took up a position in one of the front rows<br>of that crowd. Natásha heard and felt that several people were asking<br>about her and looking at her. She realized that those noticing her liked<br>her, and this observation helped to calm her.<br><br>“There are some like ourselves and some worse,” she thought.<br><br>Perónskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people<br>at the ball.<br><br>“That is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? That gray-haired man,”<br>she said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray curly<br>hair, who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said.<br><br>“Ah, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, Countess Bezúkhova,”<br>said Perónskaya, indicating Hélène who had just entered. “How<br>lovely! She is quite equal to Márya Antónovna. See how the men, young<br>and old, pay court to her. Beautiful and clever... they say Prince<br>—— is quite mad about her. But see, those two, though not<br>good-looking, are even more run after.”<br><br>She pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain<br>daughter.<br><br>“She is a splendid match, a millionairess,” said Perónskaya. “And<br>look, here come her suitors.”<br><br>“That is Bezúkhova’s brother, Anatole Kurágin,” she said,<br>indicating a handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them<br>with head erect, looking at something over the heads of the ladies.<br>“He’s handsome, isn’t he? I hear they will marry him to that rich<br>girl. But your cousin, Drubetskóy, is also very attentive to her. They<br>say she has millions. Oh yes, that’s the French ambassador himself!”<br>she replied to the countess’ inquiry about Caulaincourt. “Looks as<br>if he were a king! All the same, the French are charming, very charming.<br>No one more charming in society. Ah, here she is! Yes, she is still the<br>most beautiful of them all, our Márya Antónovna! And how simply she<br>is dressed! Lovely! And that stout one in spectacles is the universal<br>Freemason,” she went on, indicating Pierre. “Put him beside his wife<br>and he looks a regular buffoon!”<br><br>Pierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way through the crowd<br>and nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly as if he<br>were passing through a crowd at a fair. He pushed through, evidently<br>looking for someone.<br><br>Natásha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre, “the<br>buffoon,” as Perónskaya had called him, and knew he was looking for<br>them, and for her in particular. He had promised to be at the ball and<br>introduce partners to her.<br><br>But before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome, dark<br>man of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a window<br>talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon. Natásha at once<br>recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform: it was<br>Bolkónski, who seemed to her to have grown much younger, happier, and<br>better-looking.<br><br>“There’s someone else we know—Bolkónski, do you see, Mamma?”<br>said Natásha, pointing out Prince Andrew. “You remember, he stayed a<br>night with us at Otrádnoe.”<br><br>“Oh, you know him?” said Perónskaya. “I can’t bear him. Il fait<br>à présent la pluie et le beau temps. * He’s too proud for anything.<br>Takes after his father. And he’s hand in glove with Speránski,<br>writing some project or other. Just look how he treats the ladies!<br>There’s one talking to him and he has turned away,” she said,<br>pointing at him. “I’d give it to him if he treated me as he does<br>those ladies.”<br><br>    * “He is all the rage just now.”<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>Suddenly everybody stirred, began talking, and pressed forward and then<br>back, and between the two rows, which separated, the Emperor entered to<br>the sounds of music that had immediately struck up. Behind him walked<br>his host and hostess. He walked in rapidly, bowing to right and left<br>as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over. The band<br>played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that<br>had been set to it, beginning: “Alexander, Elisaveta, all our hearts<br>you ravish quite...” The Emperor passed on to the drawing room, the<br>crowd made a rush for the doors, and several persons with excited faces<br>hurried there and back again. Then the crowd hastily retired from<br>the drawing room door, at which the Emperor reappeared talking to the<br>hostess. A young man, looking distraught, pounced down on the ladies,<br>asking them to move aside. Some ladies, with faces betraying complete<br>forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum, pushed forward to the<br>detriment of their toilets. The men began to choose partners and take<br>their places for the polonaise.<br><br>Everyone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing<br>room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the<br>music. The host followed with Márya Antónovna Narýshkina; then<br>came ambassadors, ministers, and various generals, whom Perónskaya<br>diligently named. More than half the ladies already had partners<br>and were taking up, or preparing to take up, their positions for the<br>polonaise. Natásha felt that she would be left with her mother and<br>Sónya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall, not having<br>been invited to dance. She stood with her slender arms hanging down,<br>her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly, and with<br>bated breath and glittering, frightened eyes gazed straight before<br>her, evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery. She was<br>not concerned about the Emperor or any of those great people whom<br>Perónskaya was pointing out—she had but one thought: “Is it<br>possible no one will ask me, that I shall not be among the first to<br>dance? Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me?<br>They do not even seem to see me, or if they do they look as if they<br>were saying, ‘Ah, she’s not the one I’m after, so it’s not worth<br>looking at her!’ No, it’s impossible,” she thought. “They must<br>know how I long to dance, how splendidly I dance, and how they would<br>enjoy dancing with me.”<br><br>The strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable<br>time, had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Natásha’s ears.<br>She wanted to cry. Perónskaya had left them. The count was at the<br>other end of the room. She and the countess and Sónya were standing by<br>themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers,<br>with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone. Prince Andrew<br>with a lady passed by, evidently not recognizing them. The handsome<br>Anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at<br>Natásha as one looks at a wall. Borís passed them twice and each time<br>turned away. Berg and his wife, who were not dancing, came up to them.<br><br>This family gathering seemed humiliating to Natásha—as if there were<br>nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball. She did not<br>listen to or look at Véra, who was telling her something about her own<br>green dress.<br><br>At last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced<br>with three) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the<br>Rostóvs requesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they<br>were already close to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the<br>distinct, precise, enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz. The Emperor<br>looked smilingly down the room. A minute passed but no one had yet begun<br>dancing. An aide-de-camp, the Master of Ceremonies, went up to Countess<br>Bezúkhova and asked her to dance. She smilingly raised her hand and<br>laid it on his shoulder without looking at him. The aide-de-camp, an<br>adept in his art, grasping his partner firmly round her waist, with<br>confident deliberation started smoothly, gliding first round the edge of<br>the circle, then at the corner of the room he caught Hélène’s<br>left hand and turned her, the only sound audible, apart from the<br>ever-quickening music, being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his<br>rapid, agile feet, while at every third beat his partner’s velvet<br>dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round. Natásha<br>gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not she who was<br>dancing that first turn of the waltz.<br><br>Prince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing<br>stockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in the<br>front row of the circle not far from the Rostóvs. Baron Firhoff was<br>talking to him about the first sitting of the Council of State to be<br>held next day. Prince Andrew, as one closely connected with Speránski<br>and participating in the work of the legislative commission, could give<br>reliable information about that sitting, concerning which various rumors<br>were current. But not listening to what Firhoff was saying, he was<br>gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who<br>had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle.<br><br>Prince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperor’s<br>presence, and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to<br>dance.<br><br>Pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.<br><br>“You always dance. I have a protégée, the young Rostóva, here. Ask<br>her,” he said.<br><br>“Where is she?” asked Bolkónski. “Excuse me!” he added, turning<br>to the baron, “we will finish this conversation elsewhere—at a ball<br>one must dance.” He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated.<br>The despairing, dejected expression of Natásha’s face caught his eye.<br>He recognized her, guessed her feelings, saw that it was her début,<br>remembered her conversation at the window, and with an expression of<br>pleasure on his face approached Countess Rostóva.<br><br>“Allow me to introduce you to my daughter,” said the countess, with<br>heightened color.<br><br>“I have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess<br>remembers me,” said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite<br>belying Perónskaya’s remarks about his rudeness, and approaching<br>Natásha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed<br>his invitation. He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on<br>Natásha’s face, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly<br>brightened into a happy, grateful, childlike smile.<br><br>“I have long been waiting for you,” that frightened happy little<br>girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as<br>she raised her hand to Prince Andrew’s shoulder. They were the second<br>couple to enter the circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of<br>his day and Natásha danced exquisitely. Her little feet in their white<br>satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly, and independently<br>of herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness. Her slender<br>bare arms and neck were not beautiful—compared to Hélène’s her<br>shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped. But Hélène seemed, as<br>it were, hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had<br>scanned her person, while Natásha was like a girl exposed for the first<br>time, who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured<br>that this was absolutely necessary.<br><br>Prince Andrew liked dancing, and wishing to escape as quickly as<br>possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed<br>to him, wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked,<br>caused by the Emperor’s presence, he danced, and had chosen Natásha<br>because Pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first<br>pretty girl who caught his eye; but scarcely had he embraced that<br>slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling<br>so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head, and he<br>felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood<br>breathing deeply and watching the other dancers.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVII<br><br>After Prince Andrew, Borís came up to ask Natásha for a dance, and<br>then the aide-de-camp who had opened the ball, and several other young<br>men, so that, flushed and happy, and passing on her superfluous partners<br>to Sónya, she did not cease dancing all the evening. She noticed and<br>saw nothing of what occupied everyone else. Not only did she fail to<br>notice that the Emperor talked a long time with the French ambassador,<br>and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady, or that Prince<br>So-and-so and So-and-so did and said this and that, and that Hélène<br>had great success and was honored by the special attention of So-and-so,<br>but she did not even see the Emperor, and only noticed that he had gone<br>because the ball became livelier after his departure. For one of the<br>merry cotillions before supper Prince Andrew was again her partner. He<br>reminded her of their first encounter in the Otrádnoe avenue, and how<br>she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night, and told her how he<br>had involuntarily overheard her. Natásha blushed at that recollection<br>and tried to excuse herself, as if there had been something to be<br>ashamed of in what Prince Andrew had overheard.<br><br>Like all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrew liked meeting<br>someone there not of the conventional society stamp. And such was<br>Natásha, with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, and even her<br>mistakes in speaking French. With her he behaved with special care and<br>tenderness, sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most<br>unimportant matters; he admired her shy grace. In the middle of the<br>cotillion, having completed one of the figures, Natásha, still out of<br>breath, was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her. She was<br>tired and panting and evidently thought of declining, but immediately<br>put her hand gaily on the man’s shoulder, smiling at Prince Andrew.<br><br>“I’d be glad to sit beside you and rest: I’m tired; but you see<br>how they keep asking me, and I’m glad of it, I’m happy and I love<br>everybody, and you and I understand it all,” and much, much more was<br>said in her smile. When her partner left her Natásha ran across the<br>room to choose two ladies for the figure.<br><br>“If she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she will be<br>my wife,” said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own surprise, as<br>he watched her. She did go first to her cousin.<br><br>“What rubbish sometimes enters one’s head!” thought Prince Andrew,<br>“but what is certain is that that girl is so charming, so original,<br>that she won’t be dancing here a month before she will be married....<br>Such as she are rare here,” he thought, as Natásha, readjusting a<br>rose that was slipping on her bodice, settled herself beside him.<br><br>When the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to<br>the dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and asked<br>his daughter whether she was enjoying herself. Natásha did not answer<br>at once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully: “How<br>can you ask such a question?”<br><br>“I have never enjoyed myself so much before!” she said, and Prince<br>Andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her<br>father and instantly dropped again. Natásha was happier than she had<br>ever been in her life. She was at that height of bliss when one becomes<br>completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of<br>evil, unhappiness, or sorrow.<br><br>At that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position<br>his wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and absent-minded. A<br>deep furrow ran across his forehead, and standing by a window he stared<br>over his spectacles seeing no one.<br><br>On her way to supper Natásha passed him.<br><br>Pierre’s gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front of him.<br>She wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of her own<br>happiness.<br><br>“How delightful it is, Count!” said she. “Isn’t it?”<br><br>Pierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what she said.<br><br>“Yes, I am very glad,” he said.<br><br>“How can people be dissatisfied with anything?” thought Natásha.<br>“Especially such a capital fellow as Bezúkhov!” In Natásha’s<br>eyes all the people at the ball alike were good, kind, and splendid<br>people, loving one another; none of them capable of injuring<br>another—and so they ought all to be happy.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>Next day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his mind did not dwell<br>on it long. “Yes, it was a very brilliant ball,” and then... “Yes,<br>that little Rostóva is very charming. There’s something fresh,<br>original, un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her.” That<br>was all he thought about yesterday’s ball, and after his morning tea<br>he set to work.<br><br>But either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-disposed for work<br>and could get nothing done. He kept criticizing his own work, as he<br>often did, and was glad when he heard someone coming.<br><br>The visitor was Bítski, who served on various committees, frequented<br>all the societies in Petersburg, and a passionate devotee of the new<br>ideas and of Speránski, and a diligent Petersburg newsmonger—one of<br>those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to<br>the fashion, but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest<br>partisans. Hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into Prince<br>Andrew’s room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking. He<br>had just heard particulars of that morning’s sitting of the Council<br>of State opened by the Emperor, and he spoke of it enthusiastically. The<br>Emperor’s speech had been extraordinary. It had been a speech such as<br>only constitutional monarchs deliver. “The Sovereign plainly said<br>that the Council and Senate are estates of the realm, he said that the<br>government must rest not on authority but on secure bases. The Emperor<br>said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts<br>published,” recounted Bítski, emphasizing certain words and opening<br>his eyes significantly.<br><br>“Ah, yes! Today’s events mark an epoch, the greatest epoch in our<br>history,” he concluded.<br><br>Prince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the Council of<br>State, which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached<br>such importance, and was surprised that this event, now that it had<br>taken place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite insignificant. He<br>listened with quiet irony to Bítski’s enthusiastic account of it. A<br>very simple thought occurred to him: “What does it matter to me or to<br>Bítski what the Emperor was pleased to say at the Council? Can all that<br>make me any happier or better?”<br><br>And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest Prince<br>Andrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going to dine that<br>evening at Speránski’s, “with only a few friends,” as the host<br>had said when inviting him. The prospect of that dinner in the intimate<br>home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested Prince<br>Andrew, especially as he had not yet seen Speránski in his domestic<br>surroundings, but now he felt disinclined to go to it.<br><br>At the appointed hour, however, he entered the modest house Speránski<br>owned in the Taurida Gardens. In the parqueted dining room this small<br>house, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness (suggesting that of a<br>monastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather late, found the friendly<br>gathering of Speránski’s intimate acquaintances already assembled<br>at five o’clock. There were no ladies present except Speránski’s<br>little daughter (long-faced like her father) and her governess. The<br>other guests were Gervais, Magnítski, and Stolýpin. While still in<br>the anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato<br>laugh—a laugh such as one hears on the stage. Someone—it sounded<br>like Speránski—was distinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew<br>had never before heard Speránski’s famous laugh, and this ringing,<br>high-pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him.<br><br>He entered the dining room. The whole company were standing between two<br>windows at a small table laid with hors-d’oeuvres. Speránski, wearing<br>a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast, and evidently still<br>the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of<br>the Council of State, stood at the table with a beaming countenance. His<br>guests surrounded him. Magnítski, addressing himself to Speránski,<br>was relating an anecdote, and Speránski was laughing in advance at<br>what Magnítski was going to say. When Prince Andrew entered the room<br>Magnítski’s words were again crowned by laughter. Stolýpin gave<br>a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais<br>laughed softly with a hissing chuckle, and Speránski in a high-pitched<br>staccato manner.<br><br>Still laughing, Speránski held out his soft white hand to Prince<br>Andrew.<br><br>“Very pleased to see you, Prince,” he said. “One moment...” he<br>went on, turning to Magnítski and interrupting his story. “We have<br>agreed that this is a dinner for recreation, with not a word about<br>business!” and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh.<br><br>Prince Andrew looked at the laughing Speránski with astonishment,<br>regret, and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not<br>Speránski but someone else. Everything that had formerly appeared<br>mysterious and fascinating in Speránski suddenly became plain and<br>unattractive.<br><br>At dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to<br>consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. Before Magnítski<br>had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something<br>still funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the state<br>service, related to people in the service. It seemed that in this<br>company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted<br>that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored<br>ridicule. Speránski related how at the Council that morning a deaf<br>dignitary, when asked his opinion, replied that he thought so too.<br>Gervais gave a long account of an official revision, remarkable for the<br>stupidity of everybody concerned. Stolýpin, stuttering, broke into<br>the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed<br>under the former order of things—threatening to give a serious turn<br>to the conversation. Magnítski starting quizzing Stolýpin about his<br>vehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and the talk reverted to its<br>former lively tone.<br><br>Evidently Speránski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement<br>in a circle of friends, and his guests, understanding his wish, tried<br>to enliven him and amuse themselves. But their gaiety seemed to Prince<br>Andrew mirthless and tiresome. Speránski’s high-pitched voice struck<br>him unpleasantly, and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false<br>note. Prince Andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper<br>on the spirits of the company, but no one took any notice of his being<br>out of harmony with the general mood. They all seemed very gay.<br><br>He tried several times to join in the conversation, but his remarks were<br>tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water, and he could<br>not jest with them.<br><br>There was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it was witty and<br>might have been funny, but it lacked just that something which is the<br>salt of mirth, and they were not even aware that such a thing existed.<br><br>After dinner Speránski’s daughter and her governess rose. He patted<br>the little girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that gesture,<br>too, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.<br><br>The men remained at table over their port—English fashion. In the<br>midst of a conversation that was started about Napoleon’s Spanish<br>affairs, which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to<br>express a contrary opinion. Speránski smiled and, with an evident wish<br>to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a<br>story that had no connection with the previous conversation. For a few<br>moments all were silent.<br><br>Having sat some time at table, Speránski corked a bottle of wine and,<br>remarking, “Nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,” passed<br>it to the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk loudly<br>went into the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier were handed<br>to Speránski and he took them to his study. As soon as he had left<br>the room the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse<br>sensibly and quietly with one another.<br><br>“Now for the recitation!” said Speránski on returning from<br>his study. “A wonderful talent!” he said to Prince Andrew, and<br>Magnítski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous<br>verses in French which he had composed about various well-known<br>Petersburg people. He was interrupted several times by applause. When<br>the verses were finished Prince Andrew went up to Speránski and took<br>his leave.<br><br>“Where are you off to so early?” asked Speránski.<br><br>“I promised to go to a reception.”<br><br>They said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike,<br>impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have<br>expected anything from Speránski and from any of his own activities<br>connected with him, or ever to have attributed importance to what<br>Speránski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang in Prince<br>Andrew’s ears long after he had left the house.<br><br>When he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in<br>Petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new. He<br>recalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of his project<br>of army reform, which had been accepted for consideration and which they<br>were trying to pass over in silence simply because another, a very poor<br>one, had already been prepared and submitted to the Emperor. He thought<br>of the meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member. He remembered<br>how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and<br>procedure was discussed at those meetings, and how sedulously and<br>promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded. He<br>recalled his labors on the Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had<br>translated the articles of the Roman and French codes into Russian,<br>and he felt ashamed of himself. Then he vividly pictured to himself<br>Boguchárovo, his occupations in the country, his journey to Ryazán;<br>he remembered the peasants and Dron the village elder, and mentally<br>applying to them the Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs, he<br>felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless<br>work.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIX<br><br>Next day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before,<br>and among them at the Rostóvs’ with whom he had renewed acquaintance<br>at the ball. Apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the<br>call, he wanted to see that original, eager girl who had left such a<br>pleasant impression on his mind, in her own home.<br><br>Natásha was one of the first to meet him. She was wearing a dark-blue<br>house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier than in<br>her ball dress. She and all the Rostóv family welcomed him as an old<br>friend, simply and cordially. The whole family, whom he had formerly<br>judged severely, now seemed to him to consist of excellent, simple,<br>and kindly people. The old count’s hospitality and good nature, which<br>struck one especially in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise, were such<br>that Prince Andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner. “Yes,”<br>he thought, “they are capital people, who of course have not the<br>slightest idea what a treasure they possess in Natásha; but they are<br>kindly folk and form the best possible setting for this strikingly<br>poetic, charming girl, overflowing with life!”<br><br>In Natásha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely<br>alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world,<br>that in the Otrádnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night<br>had already begun to disconcert him. Now this world disconcerted him no<br>longer and was no longer alien to him, but he himself having entered it<br>found in it a new enjoyment.<br><br>After dinner Natásha, at Prince Andrew’s request, went to the<br>clavichord and began singing. Prince Andrew stood by a window talking<br>to the ladies and listened to her. In the midst of a phrase he ceased<br>speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him, a thing he had thought<br>impossible for him. He looked at Natásha as she sang, and something new<br>and joyful stirred in his soul. He felt happy and at the same time sad.<br>He had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep. What<br>about? His former love? The little princess? His disillusionments?...<br>His hopes for the future?... Yes and no. The chief reason was a sudden,<br>vivid sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great<br>and illimitable within him and that limited and material something that<br>he, and even she, was. This contrast weighed on and yet cheered him<br>while she sang.<br><br>As soon as Natásha had finished she went up to him and asked how he<br>liked her voice. She asked this and then became confused, feeling that<br>she ought not to have asked it. He smiled, looking at her, and said he<br>liked her singing as he liked everything she did.<br><br>Prince Andrew left the Rostóvs’ late in the evening. He went to bed<br>from habit, but soon realized that he could not sleep. Having lit his<br>candle he sat up in bed, then got up, then lay down again not at all<br>troubled by his sleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he<br>had stepped out of a stuffy room into God’s own fresh air. It did not<br>enter his head that he was in love with Natásha; he was not thinking<br>about her, but only picturing her to himself, and in consequence all<br>life appeared in a new light. “Why do I strive, why do I toil in this<br>narrow, confined frame, when life, all life with all its joys, is open<br>to me?” said he to himself. And for the first time for a very long<br>while he began making happy plans for the future. He decided that he<br>must attend to his son’s education by finding a tutor and putting<br>the boy in his charge, then he ought to retire from the service and go<br>abroad, and see England, Switzerland and Italy. “I must use my freedom<br>while I feel so much strength and youth in me,” he said to himself.<br>“Pierre was right when he said one must believe in the possibility of<br>happiness in order to be happy, and now I do believe in it. Let the dead<br>bury their dead, but while one has life one must live and be happy!”<br>thought he.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XX<br><br>One morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in<br>Moscow and Petersburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an immaculate<br>brand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his<br>temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.<br><br>“I have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately she<br>could not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more fortunate<br>with you,” he said with a smile.<br><br>“What is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service.”<br><br>“I have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count” (Berg said<br>this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be<br>agreeable), “and so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own<br>and my wife’s friends.” (He smiled still more pleasantly.) “I<br>wished to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea<br>and to supper.”<br><br>Only Countess Hélène, considering the society of such people as the<br>Bergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation.<br>Berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small<br>but select company, and why this would give him pleasure, and why though<br>he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful, he was prepared<br>to run into some expense for the sake of good society—that Pierre<br>could not refuse, and promised to come.<br><br>“But don’t be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about ten<br>minutes to eight, please. We shall make up a rubber. Our general is<br>coming. He is very good to me. We shall have supper, Count. So you will<br>do me the favor.”<br><br>Contrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at the<br>Bergs’ house, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.<br><br>Having prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs were ready<br>for their guests’ arrival.<br><br>In their new, clean, and light study with its small busts and pictures<br>and new furniture sat Berg and his wife. Berg, closely buttoned up in<br>his new uniform, sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always<br>could and should be acquainted with people above one, because only then<br>does one get satisfaction from acquaintances.<br><br>“You can get to know something, you can ask for something. See how I<br>managed from my first promotion.” (Berg measured his life not by years<br>but by promotions.) “My comrades are still nobodies, while I am only<br>waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment, and have the happiness to<br>be your husband.” (He rose and kissed Véra’s hand, and on the way<br>to her straightened out a turned-up corner of the carpet.) “And<br>how have I obtained all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my<br>aquaintances. It goes without saying that one must be conscientious and<br>methodical.”<br><br>Berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, and<br>paused, reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak<br>woman who could not understand all that constitutes a man’s dignity,<br>what it was ein Mann zu sein. * Véra at the same time smiling with a<br>sense of superiority over her good, conscientious husband, who all the<br>same understood life wrongly, as according to Véra all men did. Berg,<br>judging by his wife, thought all women weak and foolish. Véra, judging<br>only by her husband and generalizing from that observation, supposed<br>that all men, though they understand nothing and are conceited and<br>selfish, ascribe common sense to themselves alone.<br><br>    * To be a man.<br><br>Berg rose and embraced his wife carefully, so as not to crush her lace<br>fichu for which he had paid a good price, kissing her straight on the<br>lips.<br><br>“The only thing is, we mustn’t have children too soon,” he<br>continued, following an unconscious sequence of ideas.<br><br>“Yes,” answered Véra, “I don’t at all want that. We must live<br>for society.”<br><br>“Princess Yusúpova wore one exactly like this,” said Berg, pointing<br>to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile.<br><br>Just then Count Bezúkhov was announced. Husband and wife glanced at one<br>another, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each mentally claiming<br>the honor of this visit.<br><br>“This is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances,” thought<br>Berg. “This is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself.”<br><br>“But please don’t interrupt me when I am entertaining the guests,”<br>said Véra, “because I know what interests each of them and what to<br>say to different people.”<br><br>Berg smiled again.<br><br>“It can’t be helped: men must sometimes have masculine<br>conversation,” said he.<br><br>They received Pierre in their small, new drawing room, where it was<br>impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry,<br>neatness, and order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that<br>Berg, having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair<br>or of the sofa for his dear guest, but being apparently painfully<br>undecided on the matter himself, eventually left the visitor to settle<br>the question of selection. Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a<br>chair for himself, and Berg and Véra immediately began their evening<br>party, interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their<br>guest.<br><br>Véra, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be<br>entertained with conversation about the French embassy, at once began<br>accordingly. Berg, having decided that masculine conversation was<br>required, interrupted his wife’s remarks and touched on the question<br>of the war with Austria, and unconsciously jumped from the general<br>subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take<br>part in the Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them.<br>Though the conversation was very incoherent and Véra was angry at the<br>intrusion of the masculine element, both husband and wife felt with<br>satisfaction that, even if only one guest was present, their evening had<br>begun very well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party<br>with its talk, tea, and lighted candles.<br><br>Before long Borís, Berg’s old comrade, arrived. There was a shade of<br>condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and Véra. After<br>Borís came a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the<br>Rostóvs, and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other<br>evening parties. Berg and Véra could not repress their smiles of<br>satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room,<br>at the sound of the disconnected talk, the rustling of dresses, and the<br>bowing and scraping. Everything was just as everybody always has it,<br>especially so the general, who admired the apartment, patted Berg on the<br>shoulder, and with parental authority superintended the setting out of<br>the table for boston. The general sat down by Count Ilyá Rostóv, who<br>was next to himself the most important guest. The old people sat with<br>the old, the young with the young, and the hostess at the tea table, on<br>which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as<br>the Panins had at their party. Everything was just as it was everywhere<br>else.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXI<br><br>Pierre, as one of the principal guests, had to sit down to boston<br>with Count Rostóv, the general, and the colonel. At the card table he<br>happened to be directly facing Natásha, and was struck by a curious<br>change that had come over her since the ball. She was silent, and not<br>only less pretty than at the ball, but only redeemed from plainness by<br>her look of gentle indifference to everything around.<br><br>“What’s the matter with her?” thought Pierre, glancing at her.<br>She was sitting by her sister at the tea table, and reluctantly, without<br>looking at him, made some reply to Borís who sat down beside her. After<br>playing out a whole suit and to his partner’s delight taking five<br>tricks, Pierre, hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had<br>entered the room while he was picking up his tricks, glanced again at<br>Natásha.<br><br>“What has happened to her?” he asked himself with still greater<br>surprise.<br><br>Prince Andrew was standing before her, saying something to her with a<br>look of tender solicitude. She, having raised her head, was looking up<br>at him, flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing. And<br>the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again<br>alight in her. She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had<br>again become what she had been at the ball.<br><br>Prince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and<br>youthful expression in his friend’s face.<br><br>Pierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now with<br>his back to Natásha and now facing her, but during the whole of the six<br>rubbers he watched her and his friend.<br><br>“Something very important is happening between them,” thought<br>Pierre, and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and<br>made him neglect the game.<br><br>After six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use playing<br>like that, and Pierre was released. Natásha on one side was talking<br>with Sónya and Borís, and Véra with a subtle smile was saying<br>something to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and, asking<br>whether they were talking secrets, sat down beside them. Véra, having<br>noticed Prince Andrew’s attentions to Natásha, decided that at a<br>party, a real evening party, subtle allusions to the tender passion were<br>absolutely necessary and, seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone,<br>began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her<br>sister. With so intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to<br>be, she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact.<br><br>When Pierre went up to them he noticed that Véra was being carried away<br>by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed, a<br>thing that rarely happened with him.<br><br>“What do you think?” Véra was saying with an arch smile. “You are<br>so discerning, Prince, and understand people’s characters so well at<br>a glance. What do you think of Natalie? Could she be constant in her<br>attachments? Could she, like other women” (Véra meant herself),<br>“love a man once for all and remain true to him forever? That is what<br>I consider true love. What do you think, Prince?”<br><br>“I know your sister too little,” replied Prince Andrew, with a<br>sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment, “to<br>be able to solve so delicate a question, and then I have noticed that<br>the less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be,”<br>he added, and looked up at Pierre who was just approaching them.<br><br>“Yes, that is true, Prince. In our days,” continued<br>Véra—mentioning “our days” as people of limited intelligence are<br>fond of doing, imagining that they have discovered and appraised the<br>peculiarities of “our days” and that human characteristics change<br>with the times—“in our days a girl has so much freedom that the<br>pleasure of being courted often stifles real feeling in her. And it must<br>be confessed that Natalie is very susceptible.” This return to<br>the subject of Natalie caused Prince Andrew to knit his brows with<br>discomfort: he was about to rise, but Véra continued with a still more<br>subtle smile:<br><br>“I think no one has been more courted than she,” she went on, “but<br>till quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone. Now you know,<br>Count,” she said to Pierre, “even our dear cousin Borís, who,<br>between ourselves, was very far gone in the land of tenderness...”<br>(alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time).<br><br>Prince Andrew frowned and remained silent.<br><br>“You are friendly with Borís, aren’t you?” asked Véra.<br><br>“Yes, I know him....”<br><br>“I expect he has told you of his childish love for Natásha?”<br><br>“Oh, there was childish love?” suddenly asked Prince Andrew,<br>blushing unexpectedly.<br><br>“Yes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love. Le<br>cousinage est un dangereux voisinage. * Don’t you think so?”<br><br>    * “Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.”<br><br><br>“Oh, undoubtedly!” said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural<br>liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very careful<br>with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of these<br>jesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside.<br><br>“Well?” asked Pierre, seeing his friend’s strange animation with<br>surprise, and noticing the glance he turned on Natásha as he rose.<br><br>“I must... I must have a talk with you,” said Prince Andrew. “You<br>know that pair of women’s gloves?” (He referred to the Masonic<br>gloves given to a newly initiated Brother to present to the woman he<br>loved.) “I... but no, I will talk to you later on,” and with a<br>strange light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements, Prince<br>Andrew approached Natásha and sat down beside her. Pierre saw how<br>Prince Andrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied.<br><br>But at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting that he<br>should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on<br>the affairs in Spain.<br><br>Berg was satisfied and happy. The smile of pleasure never left his face.<br>The party was very successful and quite like other parties he had<br>seen. Everything was similar: the ladies’ subtle talk, the cards, the<br>general raising his voice at the card table, and the samovar and the tea<br>cakes; only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening<br>parties he wished to imitate. They had not yet had a loud conversation<br>among the men and a dispute about something important and clever. Now<br>the general had begun such a discussion and so Berg drew Pierre to it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXII<br><br>Next day, having been invited by the count, Prince Andrew dined with the<br>Rostóvs and spent the rest of the day there.<br><br>Everyone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew came, and<br>without concealing it he tried to be with Natásha all day. Not only in<br>the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured Natásha, but in the<br>whole house, there was a feeling of awe at something important that was<br>bound to happen. The countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes<br>at Prince Andrew when he talked to Natásha and timidly started some<br>artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way.<br>Sónya was afraid to leave Natásha and afraid of being in the way when<br>she was with them. Natásha grew pale, in a panic of expectation, when<br>she remained alone with him for a moment. Prince Andrew surprised her by<br>his timidity. She felt that he wanted to say something to her but could<br>not bring himself to do so.<br><br>In the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess went up to<br>Natásha and whispered: “Well, what?”<br><br>“Mamma! For heaven’s sake don’t ask me anything now! One can’t<br>talk about that,” said Natásha.<br><br>But all the same that night Natásha, now agitated and now frightened,<br>lay a long time in her mother’s bed gazing straight before her. She<br>told her how he had complimented her, how he told her he was going<br>abroad, asked her where they were going to spend the summer, and then<br>how he had asked her about Borís.<br><br>“But such a... such a... never happened to me before!” she said.<br>“Only I feel afraid in his presence. I am always afraid when I’m<br>with him. What does that mean? Does it mean that it’s the real thing?<br>Yes? Mamma, are you asleep?”<br><br>“No, my love; I am frightened myself,” answered her mother. “Now<br>go!”<br><br>“All the same I shan’t sleep. What silliness, to sleep! Mummy!<br>Mummy! such a thing never happened to me before,” she said, surprised<br>and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself. “And could we<br>ever have thought!...”<br><br>It seemed to Natásha that even at the time she first saw Prince Andrew<br>at Otrádnoe she had fallen in love with him. It was as if she feared<br>this strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had<br>then chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and of finding<br>him, as it seemed, not indifferent to her.<br><br>“And it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg<br>while we are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that<br>ball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this!<br>Already then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar.”<br><br>“What else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them...”<br>said her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince Andrew<br>had written in Natásha’s album.<br><br>“Mamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?”<br><br>“Don’t, Natásha! Pray to God. ‘Marriages are made in<br>heaven,’” said her mother.<br><br>“Darling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!” cried Natásha,<br>shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother.<br><br>At that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him<br>of his love for Natásha and his firm resolve to make her his wife.<br><br>That day Countess Hélène had a reception at her house. The French<br>ambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of<br>late become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies and<br>gentlemen. Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the rooms and<br>struck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and morose air.<br><br>Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression<br>and had made desperate efforts to combat it. Since the intimacy of<br>his wife with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly been made a<br>gentleman of the bedchamber, and from that time he had begun to feel<br>oppressed and ashamed in court society, and dark thoughts of the vanity<br>of all things human came to him oftener than before. At the same time<br>the feeling he had noticed between his protégée Natásha and Prince<br>Andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position<br>and his friend’s. He tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife,<br>and about Natásha and Prince Andrew; and again everything seemed to him<br>insignificant in comparison with eternity; again the question: for what?<br>presented itself; and he forced himself to work day and night at Masonic<br>labors, hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him. Toward<br>midnight, after he had left the countess’ apartments, he was sitting<br>upstairs in a shabby dressing gown, copying out the original transaction<br>of the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy<br>with tobacco smoke, when someone came in. It was Prince Andrew.<br><br>“Ah, it’s you!” said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air.<br>“And I, you see, am hard at it.” He pointed to his manuscript book<br>with that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy<br>people look at their work.<br><br>Prince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed life on<br>his face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look,<br>smiled at him with the egotism of joy.<br><br>“Well, dear heart,” said he, “I wanted to tell you about it<br>yesterday and I have come to do so today. I never experienced anything<br>like it before. I am in love, my friend!”<br><br>Suddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on<br>the sofa beside Prince Andrew.<br><br>“With Natásha Rostóva, yes?” said he.<br><br>“Yes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it,<br>but the feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and<br>suffered, but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in<br>the world, I have not lived till now. At last I live, but I can’t<br>live without her! But can she love me?... I am too old for her.... Why<br>don’t you speak?”<br><br>“I? I? What did I tell you?” said Pierre suddenly, rising and<br>beginning to pace up and down the room. “I always thought it.... That<br>girl is such a treasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend,<br>I entreat you, don’t philosophize, don’t doubt, marry, marry,<br>marry.... And I am sure there will not be a happier man than you.”<br><br>“But what of her?”<br><br>“She loves you.”<br><br>“Don’t talk rubbish...” said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking<br>into Pierre’s eyes.<br><br>“She does, I know,” Pierre cried fiercely.<br><br>“But do listen,” returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the<br>arm. “Do you know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to<br>someone.”<br><br>“Well, go on, go on. I am very glad,” said Pierre, and his face<br>really changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince<br>Andrew. Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, quite a different, quite<br>a new man. Where was his spleen, his contempt for life, his<br>disillusionment? Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind<br>to speak openly; and to him he told all that was in his soul. Now he<br>boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future, said he could not<br>sacrifice his own happiness to his father’s caprice, and spoke of how<br>he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her,<br>or would do without his consent; then he marveled at the feeling that<br>had mastered him as at something strange, apart from and independent of<br>himself.<br><br>“I should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of<br>such love,” said Prince Andrew. “It is not at all the same feeling<br>that I knew in the past. The whole world is now for me divided into two<br>halves: one half is she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the<br>other half is everything where she is not, and there is all gloom and<br>darkness....”<br><br>“Darkness and gloom,” reiterated Pierre: “yes, yes, I understand<br>that.”<br><br>“I cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I am very<br>happy! You understand me? I know you are glad for my sake.”<br><br>“Yes, yes,” Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched<br>and sad expression in his eyes. The brighter Prince Andrew’s lot<br>appeared to him, the gloomier seemed his own.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXIII<br><br>Prince Andrew needed his father’s consent to his marriage, and to<br>obtain this he started for the country next day.<br><br>His father received his son’s communication with external composure,<br>but inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to<br>alter his life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life<br>was already ending. “If only they would let me end my days as I want<br>to,” thought the old man, “then they might do as they please.”<br>With his son, however, he employed the diplomacy he reserved for<br>important occasions and, adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole<br>matter.<br><br>In the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards<br>birth, wealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young<br>as he had been and his health was poor (the old man laid special stress<br>on this), while she was very young. Thirdly, he had a son whom it would<br>be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl. “Fourthly and finally,”<br>the father said, looking ironically at his son, “I beg you to put it<br>off for a year: go abroad, take a cure, look out as you wanted to for<br>a German tutor for Prince Nicholas. Then if your love or passion or<br>obstinacy—as you please—is still as great, marry! And that’s my<br>last word on it. Mind, the last...” concluded the prince, in a tone<br>which showed that nothing would make him alter his decision.<br><br>Prince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings, or<br>his fiancée’s, would not stand a year’s test, or that he (the old<br>prince himself) would die before then, and he decided to conform to his<br>father’s wish—to propose, and postpone the wedding for a year.<br><br>Three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the Rostóvs,<br>Prince Andrew returned to Petersburg.<br><br><br>Next day after her talk with her mother Natásha expected Bolkónski all<br>day, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the same.<br>Pierre did not come either and Natásha, not knowing that Prince Andrew<br>had gone to see his father, could not explain his absence to herself.<br><br>Three weeks passed in this way. Natásha had no desire to go out<br>anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and<br>listless; she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the<br>evenings. She blushed continually and was irritable. It seemed to her<br>that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and<br>pitying her. Strong as was her inward grief, this wound to her vanity<br>intensified her misery.<br><br>Once she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly began<br>to cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why<br>it is being punished.<br><br>The countess began to soothe Natásha, who after first listening to her<br>mother’s words, suddenly interrupted her:<br><br>“Leave off, Mamma! I don’t think, and don’t want to think about<br>it! He just came and then left off, left off....”<br><br>Her voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and went<br>on quietly:<br><br>“And I don’t at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I<br>have now become quite calm, quite calm.”<br><br>The day after this conversation Natásha put on the old dress which<br>she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the<br>mornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had<br>abandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea she went to<br>the ballroom, which she particularly liked for its loud resonance, and<br>began singing her solfeggio. When she had finished her first exercise<br>she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that<br>particularly pleased her. She listened joyfully (as though she had not<br>expected it) to the charm of the notes reverberating, filling the<br>whole empty ballroom, and slowly dying away; and all at once she felt<br>cheerful. “What’s the good of making so much of it? Things are nice<br>as it is,” she said to herself, and she began walking up and down the<br>room, not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with<br>each step from the heel to the toe (she had on a new and favorite pair<br>of shoes) and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of<br>the toe as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice. Passing a<br>mirror she glanced into it. “There, that’s me!” the expression of<br>her face seemed to say as she caught sight of herself. “Well, and very<br>nice too! I need nobody.”<br><br>A footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she<br>would not let him, and having closed the door behind him continued her<br>walk. That morning she had returned to her favorite mood—love of,<br>and delight in, herself. “How charming that Natásha is!” she said<br>again, speaking as some third, collective, male person. “Pretty,<br>a good voice, young, and in nobody’s way if only they leave her in<br>peace.” But however much they left her in peace she could not now be<br>at peace, and immediately felt this.<br><br>In the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, “At home?” and<br>then footsteps were heard. Natásha was looking at the mirror, but did<br>not see herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When she saw<br>herself, her face was pale. It was he. She knew this for certain, though<br>she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors.<br><br>Pale and agitated, Natásha ran into the drawing room.<br><br>“Mamma! Bolkónski has come!” she said. “Mamma, it is awful, it is<br>unbearable! I don’t want... to be tormented? What am I to do?...”<br><br>Before the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room with<br>an agitated and serious face. As soon as he saw Natásha his face<br>brightened. He kissed the countess’ hand and Natásha’s, and sat<br>down beside the sofa.<br><br>“It is long since we had the pleasure...” began the countess,<br>but Prince Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question,<br>obviously in haste to say what he had to.<br><br>“I have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my<br>father’s. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I only<br>got back last night,” he said glancing at Natásha; “I want to have<br>a talk with you, Countess,” he added after a moment’s pause.<br><br>The countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply.<br><br>“I am at your disposal,” she murmured.<br><br>Natásha knew that she ought to go away, but was unable to do so:<br>something gripped her throat, and regardless of manners she stared<br>straight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes.<br><br>“At once? This instant!... No, it can’t be!” she thought.<br><br>Again he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she was not<br>mistaken. Yes, at once, that very instant, her fate would be decided.<br><br>“Go, Natásha! I will call you,” said the countess in a whisper.<br><br>Natásha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew and at<br>her mother and went out.<br><br>“I have come, Countess, to ask for your daughter’s hand,” said<br>Prince Andrew.<br><br>The countess’ face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.<br><br>“Your offer...” she began at last sedately. He remained silent,<br>looking into her eyes. “Your offer...” (she grew confused) “is<br>agreeable to us, and I accept your offer. I am glad. And my husband... I<br>hope... but it will depend on her....”<br><br>“I will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do you give it to<br>me?” said Prince Andrew.<br><br>“Yes,” replied the countess. She held out her hand to him, and with<br>a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his<br>forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. She wished to love him as a<br>son, but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man. “I<br>am sure my husband will consent,” said the countess, “but your<br>father...”<br><br>“My father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express<br>condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a<br>year. And I wished to tell you of that,” said Prince Andrew.<br><br>“It is true that Natásha is still young, but—so long as that?...”<br><br>“It is unavoidable,” said Prince Andrew with a sigh.<br><br>“I will send her to you,” said the countess, and left the room.<br><br>“Lord have mercy upon us!” she repeated while seeking her daughter.<br><br>Sónya said that Natásha was in her bedroom. Natásha was sitting on<br>the bed, pale and dry-eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispering<br>something as she rapidly crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped<br>up and flew to her.<br><br>“Well, Mamma?... Well?...”<br><br>“Go, go to him. He is asking for your hand,” said the countess,<br>coldly it seemed to Natásha. “Go... go,” said the mother, sadly and<br>reproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away.<br><br>Natásha never remembered how she entered the drawing room. When she<br>came in and saw him she paused. “Is it possible that this stranger<br>has now become everything to me?” she asked herself, and immediately<br>answered, “Yes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me than<br>everything in the world.” Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast<br>eyes.<br><br>“I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you. May I hope?”<br><br>He looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of<br>her face. Her face said: “Why ask? Why doubt what you cannot but know?<br>Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?”<br><br>She drew near to him and stopped. He took her hand and kissed it.<br><br>“Do you love me?”<br><br>“Yes, yes!” Natásha murmured as if in vexation. Then she sighed<br>loudly and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.<br><br>“What is it? What’s the matter?”<br><br>“Oh, I am so happy!” she replied, smiled through her tears, bent<br>over closer to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether<br>she might, and then kissed him.<br><br>Prince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find<br>in his heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly<br>changed; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of<br>desire, but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear<br>at her devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful sense of<br>the duty that now bound him to her forever. The present feeling, though<br>not so bright and poetic as the former, was stronger and more serious.<br><br>“Did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?” asked<br>Prince Andrew, still looking into her eyes.<br><br>“Is it possible that I—the ‘chit of a girl,’ as everybody called<br>me,” thought Natásha—“is it possible that I am now to be the<br>wife and the equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father<br>looks up to? Can it be true? Can it be true that there can be no<br>more playing with life, that now I am grown up, that on me now lies<br>a responsibility for my every word and deed? Yes, but what did he ask<br>me?”<br><br>“No,” she replied, but she had not understood his question.<br><br>“Forgive me!” he said. “But you are so young, and I have already<br>been through so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know<br>yourself.”<br><br>Natásha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing to<br>take in the meaning of his words.<br><br>“Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be,” continued<br>Prince Andrew, “it will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask<br>you to make me happy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall<br>remain a secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or should<br>you come to love...” said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile.<br><br>“Why do you say that?” Natásha interrupted him. “You know that<br>from the very day you first came to Otrádnoe I have loved you,” she<br>cried, quite convinced that she spoke the truth.<br><br>“In a year you will learn to know yourself....”<br><br>“A whole year!” Natásha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that<br>the marriage was to be postponed for a year. “But why a year? Why a<br>year?...”<br><br>Prince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay.<br>Natásha did not hear him.<br><br>“And can’t it be helped?” she asked. Prince Andrew did not reply,<br>but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision.<br><br>“It’s awful! Oh, it’s awful! awful!” Natásha suddenly cried,<br>and again burst into sobs. “I shall die, waiting a year: it’s<br>impossible, it’s awful!” She looked into her lover’s face and saw<br>in it a look of commiseration and perplexity.<br><br>“No, no! I’ll do anything!” she said, suddenly checking her tears.<br>“I am so happy.”<br><br>The father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple<br>their blessing.<br><br>From that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rostóvs’ as<br>Natásha’s affianced lover.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXIV<br><br>No betrothal ceremony took place and Natásha’s engagement to<br>Bolkónski was not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. He said<br>that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole<br>burden of it; that he had given his word and bound himself forever, but<br>that he did not wish to bind Natásha and gave her perfect freedom. If<br>after six months she felt that she did not love him she would have full<br>right to reject him. Naturally neither Natásha nor her parents wished<br>to hear of this, but Prince Andrew was firm. He came every day to the<br>Rostóvs’, but did not behave to Natásha as an affianced lover: he<br>did not use the familiar thou, but said you to her, and kissed only her<br>hand. After their engagement, quite different, intimate, and natural<br>relations sprang up between them. It was as if they had not known each<br>other till now. Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other<br>when as yet they were nothing to one another; they felt themselves<br>now quite different beings: then they were artificial, now natural and<br>sincere. At first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with<br>Prince Andrew; he seemed a man from another world, and for a long time<br>Natásha trained the family to get used to him, proudly assuring them<br>all that he only appeared to be different, but was really just like all<br>of them, and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be.<br>After a few days they grew accustomed to him, and without restraint in<br>his presence pursued their usual way of life, in which he took his part.<br>He could talk about rural economy with the count, fashions with the<br>countess and Natásha, and about albums and fancywork with Sónya.<br>Sometimes the household both among themselves and in his presence<br>expressed their wonder at how it had all happened, and at the evident<br>omens there had been of it: Prince Andrew’s coming to Otrádnoe and<br>their coming to Petersburg, and the likeness between Natásha and Prince<br>Andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit, and Andrew’s<br>encounter with Nicholas in 1805, and many other incidents betokening<br>that it had to be.<br><br>In the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always<br>accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sitting<br>together everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others would get up and<br>go away and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They rarely<br>spoke of their future life. Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to<br>speak of it. Natásha shared this as she did all his feelings, which she<br>constantly divined. Once she began questioning him about his son. Prince<br>Andrew blushed, as he often did now—Natásha particularly liked it in<br>him—and said that his son would not live with them.<br><br>“Why not?” asked Natásha in a frightened tone.<br><br>“I cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...”<br><br>“How I should have loved him!” said Natásha, immediately guessing<br>his thought; “but I know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding<br>fault with us.”<br><br>Sometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, and ask<br>his advice about Pétya’s education or Nicholas’ service. The<br>old countess sighed as she looked at them; Sónya was always getting<br>frightened lest she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for<br>leaving them alone, even when they did not wish it. When Prince Andrew<br>spoke (he could tell a story very well), Natásha listened to him<br>with pride; when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed<br>attentively and scrutinizingly at her. She asked herself in perplexity:<br>“What does he look for in me? He is trying to discover something by<br>looking at me! What if what he seeks in me is not there?” Sometimes<br>she fell into one of the mad, merry moods characteristic of her, and<br>then she particularly loved to hear and see how Prince Andrew laughed.<br>He seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his<br>laughter, and after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him. Natásha<br>would have been completely happy if the thought of the separation<br>awaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her, just as the mere<br>thought of it made him turn pale and cold.<br><br>On the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought with<br>him Pierre, who had not been to the Rostóvs’ once since the ball.<br>Pierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He was talking to the<br>countess, and Natásha sat down beside a little chess table with Sónya,<br>thereby inviting Prince Andrew to come too. He did so.<br><br>“You have known Bezúkhov a long time?” he asked. “Do you like<br>him?”<br><br>“Yes, he’s a dear, but very absurd.”<br><br>And as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of his<br>absent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.<br><br>“Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I have known him<br>from childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie,” Prince<br>Andrew said with sudden seriousness—“I am going away and heaven<br>knows what may happen. You may cease to... all right, I know I am not<br>to say that. Only this, then: whatever may happen to you when I am not<br>here...”<br><br>“What can happen?”<br><br>“Whatever trouble may come,” Prince Andrew continued, “I beg<br>you, Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him alone for<br>advice and help! He is a most absent-minded and absurd fellow, but he<br>has a heart of gold.”<br><br>Neither her father, nor her mother, nor Sónya, nor Prince Andrew<br>himself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act<br>on Natásha. Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day,<br>dry-eyed, occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding<br>what awaited her. She did not even cry when, on taking leave, he kissed<br>her hand for the last time. “Don’t go!” she said in a tone<br>that made him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he<br>remembered long afterwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone; but<br>for several days she sat in her room dry-eyed, taking no interest in<br>anything and only saying now and then, “Oh, why did he go away?”<br><br>But a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around<br>her, she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became<br>her old self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy, as a<br>child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXV<br><br>During that year after his son’s departure, Prince Nicholas<br>Bolkónski’s health and temper became much worse. He grew still more<br>irritable, and it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of his<br>frequent fits of unprovoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out<br>her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible.<br>Princess Mary had two passions and consequently two joys—her nephew,<br>little Nicholas, and religion—and these were the favorite subjects<br>of the prince’s attacks and ridicule. Whatever was spoken of he would<br>bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids, or the petting<br>and spoiling of children. “You want to make him”—little<br>Nicholas—“into an old maid like yourself! A pity! Prince Andrew<br>wants a son and not an old maid,” he would say. Or, turning to<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne, he would ask her in Princess Mary’s presence<br>how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them.<br><br>He continually hurt Princess Mary’s feelings and tormented her, but it<br>cost her no effort to forgive him. Could he be to blame toward her, or<br>could her father, whom she knew loved her in spite of it all, be unjust?<br>And what is justice? The princess never thought of that proud word<br>“justice.” All the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear<br>and simple law—the law of love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him who<br>lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself was God. What had she to<br>do with the justice or injustice of other people? She had to endure and<br>love, and that she did.<br><br>During the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been gay,<br>gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a<br>long time past. She felt that something had happened to him, but he said<br>nothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a long talk with<br>his father about something, and Princess Mary noticed that before his<br>departure they were dissatisfied with one another.<br><br>Soon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend<br>Julie Karágina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls dream)<br>of marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in mourning for her<br>own brother, killed in Turkey.<br><br>Sorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.<br><br>Your loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a<br>special providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and your<br>excellent mother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion alone, can—I<br>will not say comfort us—but save us from despair. Religion alone can<br>explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend: why, for what<br>cause, kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life—not merely<br>harming no one but necessary to the happiness of others—are called<br>away to God, while cruel, useless, harmful persons, or such as are a<br>burden to themselves and to others, are left living. The first death I<br>saw, and one I shall never forget—that of my dear sister-in-law—left<br>that impression on me. Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother<br>had to die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never wronged<br>anyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts, had to<br>die. And what do you think, dear friend? Five years have passed since<br>then, and already I, with my petty understanding, begin to see clearly<br>why she had to die, and in what way that death was but an expression<br>of the infinite goodness of the Creator, whose every action, though<br>generally incomprehensible to us, is but a manifestation of His infinite<br>love for His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically<br>innocent to have the strength to perform all a mother’s duties. As a<br>young wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so<br>as a mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince<br>Andrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably she will<br>there receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of<br>her alone, that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent<br>influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. Then, at<br>the moment of our loss, these thoughts could not occur to me; I should<br>then have dismissed them with horror, but now they are very clear and<br>certain. I write all this to you, dear friend, only to convince you<br>of the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life: not<br>a single hair of our heads will fall without His will. And His will is<br>governed only by infinite love for us, and so whatever befalls us is for<br>our good.<br><br>You ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow. In spite of my<br>wish to see you, I do not think so and do not want to do so. You will<br>be surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte! The case is<br>this: my father’s health is growing noticeably worse, he cannot stand<br>any contradiction and is becoming irritable. This irritability is, as<br>you know, chiefly directed to political questions. He cannot endure<br>the notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the<br>sovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own, the grandson of the<br>Great Catherine! As you know, I am quite indifferent to politics, but<br>from my father’s remarks and his talks with Michael Ivánovich I know<br>all that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred<br>on Buonaparte, who only at Bald Hills in the whole world, it seems, is<br>not accepted as a great man, still less as Emperor of France. And my<br>father cannot stand this. It seems to me that it is chiefly because of<br>his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to<br>Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way<br>of expressing his views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might<br>derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the<br>disputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In any case it will<br>be decided very shortly.<br><br>Our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother Andrew’s<br>absence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much of late. After<br>his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits. He has again<br>become as I used to know him when a child: kind, affectionate, with that<br>heart of gold to which I know no equal. He has realized, it seems to me,<br>that life is not over for him. But together with this mental change<br>he has grown physically much weaker. He has become thinner and more<br>nervous. I am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad<br>which the doctors recommended long ago. I hope it will cure him. You<br>write that in Petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active,<br>cultivated, and capable of the young men. Forgive my vanity as a<br>relation, but I never doubted it. The good he has done to everybody<br>here, from his peasants up to the gentry, is incalculable. On his<br>arrival in Petersburg he received only his due. I always wonder at the<br>way rumors fly from Petersburg to Moscow, especially such false ones as<br>that you write about—I mean the report of my brother’s betrothal to<br>the little Rostóva. I do not think my brother will ever marry again,<br>and certainly not her; and this is why: first, I know that though he<br>rarely speaks about the wife he has lost, the grief of that loss<br>has gone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a<br>successor and our little angel a stepmother. Secondly because, as far<br>as I know, that girl is not the kind of girl who could please Prince<br>Andrew. I do not think he would choose her for a wife, and frankly I do<br>not wish it. But I am running on too long and am at the end of my second<br>sheet. Good-by, my dear friend. May God keep you in His holy and mighty<br>care. My dear friend, Mademoiselle Bourienne, sends you kisses.<br><br>MARY<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXVI<br><br>In the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected letter<br>from Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her strange and<br>surprising news. He informed her of his engagement to Natásha Rostóva.<br>The whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender<br>and confiding affection for his sister. He wrote that he had never loved<br>as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life<br>was. He asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his<br>resolve when he had last visited Bald Hills, though he had spoken of it<br>to his father. He had not done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her<br>father to give his consent, irritating him and having to bear the brunt<br>of his displeasure without attaining her object. “Besides,” he<br>wrote, “the matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now.<br>My father then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months,<br>half of that period, have passed, and my resolution is firmer than ever.<br>If the doctors did not keep me here at the spas I should be back in<br>Russia, but as it is I have to postpone my return for three months. You<br>know me and my relations with Father. I want nothing from him. I have<br>been and always shall be independent; but to go against his will and<br>arouse his anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short<br>time, would destroy half my happiness. I am now writing to him about<br>the same question, and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the<br>letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether<br>there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months.”<br><br>After long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave the<br>letter to her father. The next day the old prince said to her quietly:<br><br>“Write and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It won’t be<br>long—I shall soon set him free.”<br><br>The princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her speak<br>and, raising his voice more and more, cried:<br><br>“Marry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, eh? Rich,<br>eh? Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! Write and tell him<br>that he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She will be little Nicholas’<br>stepmother and I’ll marry Bourienne!... Ha, ha, ha! He mustn’t be<br>without a stepmother either! Only one thing, no more women are wanted<br>in my house—let him marry and live by himself. Perhaps you will go<br>and live with him too?” he added, turning to Princess Mary. “Go in<br>heaven’s name! Go out into the frost... the frost... the frost!”<br><br>After this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter.<br>But repressed vexation at his son’s poor-spirited behavior found<br>expression in his treatment of his daughter. To his former pretexts<br>for irony a fresh one was now added—allusions to stepmothers and<br>amiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne.<br><br>“Why shouldn’t I marry her?” he asked his daughter. “She’ll<br>make a splendid princess!”<br><br>And latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary<br>noticed that her father was really associating more and more with the<br>Frenchwoman. She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his<br>letter, but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the<br>idea.<br><br>Little Nicholas and his education, her brother Andrew, and religion<br>were Princess Mary’s joys and consolations; but besides that, since<br>everyone must have personal hopes, Princess Mary in the profoundest<br>depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief<br>consolation of her life. This comforting dream and hope were given her<br>by God’s folk—the half-witted and other pilgrims who visited<br>her without the prince’s knowledge. The longer she lived, the more<br>experience and observation she had of life, the greater was her wonder<br>at the short-sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here<br>on earth: toiling, suffering, struggling, and harming one another, to<br>obtain that impossible, visionary, sinful happiness. Prince Andrew had<br>loved his wife, she died, but that was not enough: he wanted to bind<br>his happiness to another woman. Her father objected to this because he<br>wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for Andrew. And they<br>all struggled and suffered and tormented one another and injured their<br>souls, their eternal souls, for the attainment of benefits which endure<br>but for an instant. Not only do we know this ourselves, but Christ, the<br>Son of God, came down to earth and told us that this life is but for<br>a moment and is a probation; yet we cling to it and think to find<br>happiness in it. “How is it that no one realizes this?” thought<br>Princess Mary. “No one except these despised God’s folk who, wallet<br>on back, come to me by the back door, afraid of being seen by the<br>prince, not for fear of ill-usage by him but for fear of causing him<br>to sin. To leave family, home, and all the cares of worldly welfare, in<br>order without clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags from place<br>to place under an assumed name, doing no one any harm but praying for<br>all—for those who drive one away as well as for those who protect one:<br>higher than that life and truth there is no life or truth!”<br><br>There was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called<br>Theodosia, who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn<br>heavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly fond of her. Once, when in<br>a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was talking of<br>her life, the thought that Theodosia alone had found the true path of<br>life suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force that she resolved to<br>become a pilgrim herself. When Theodosia had gone to sleep Princess Mary<br>thought about this for a long time, and at last made up her mind that,<br>strange as it might seem, she must go on a pilgrimage. She disclosed<br>this thought to no one but to her confessor, Father Akínfi, the monk,<br>and he approved of her intention. Under guise of a present for the<br>pilgrims, Princess Mary prepared a pilgrim’s complete costume for<br>herself: a coarse smock, bast shoes, a rough coat, and a black kerchief.<br>Often, approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure,<br>Princess Mary paused, uncertain whether the time had not already come to<br>put her project into execution.<br><br>Often, listening to the pilgrims’ tales, she was so stimulated by<br>their simple speech, mechanical to them but to her so full of deep<br>meaning, that several times she was on the point of abandoning<br>everything and running away from home. In imagination she already<br>pictured herself by Theodosia’s side, dressed in coarse rags, walking<br>with a staff, a wallet on her back, along the dusty road, directing her<br>wanderings from one saint’s shrine to another, free from envy, earthly<br>love, or desire, and reaching at last the place where there is no more<br>sorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and bliss.<br><br>“I shall come to a place and pray there, and before having time to get<br>used to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther. I will go on till<br>my legs fail, and I’ll lie down and die somewhere, and shall at last<br>reach that eternal, quiet haven, where there is neither sorrow nor<br>sighing...” thought Princess Mary.<br><br>But afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little Koko<br>(Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt that she<br>was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK SEVEN: 1810 - 11<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>The Bible legend tells us that the absence of labor—idleness—was a<br>condition of the first man’s blessedness before the Fall. Fallen man<br>has retained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs on the race not<br>only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows, but<br>because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at<br>ease. An inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle. If man<br>could find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling<br>his duty, he would have found one of the conditions of man’s primitive<br>blessedness. And such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness<br>is the lot of a whole class—the military. The chief attraction of<br>military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and<br>irreproachable idleness.<br><br>Nicholas Rostóv experienced this blissful condition to the full when,<br>after 1807, he continued to serve in the Pávlograd regiment, in which<br>he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from Denísov.<br><br>Rostóv had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow<br>acquaintances would have considered rather bad form, but who was liked<br>and respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and was well<br>contented with his life. Of late, in 1809, he found in letters from home<br>more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling<br>into greater and greater disorder, and that it was time for him to come<br>back to gladden and comfort his old parents.<br><br>Reading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to<br>take him away from surroundings in which, protected from all the<br>entanglements of life, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt that<br>sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with<br>its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out, its accounts<br>with stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, society, and with<br>Sónya’s love and his promise to her. It was all dreadfully difficult<br>and complicated; and he replied to his mother in cold, formal letters<br>in French, beginning: “My dear Mamma,” and ending: “Your obedient<br>son,” which said nothing of when he would return. In 1810 he received<br>letters from his parents, in which they told him of Natásha’s<br>engagement to Bolkónski, and that the wedding would be in a year’s<br>time because the old prince made difficulties. This letter grieved and<br>mortified Nicholas. In the first place he was sorry that Natásha, for<br>whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family, should be lost to<br>the home; and secondly, from his hussar point of view, he regretted not<br>to have been there to show that fellow Bolkónski that connection with<br>him was no such great honor after all, and that if he loved Natásha he<br>might dispense with permission from his dotard father. For a moment he<br>hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see Natásha<br>before she was married, but then came the maneuvers, and considerations<br>about Sónya and about the confusion of their affairs, and Nicholas<br>again put it off. But in the spring of that year, he received a letter<br>from his mother, written without his father’s knowledge, and that<br>letter persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not come and<br>take matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and<br>they would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and trusted<br>Mítenka so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody took advantage<br>of him and things were going from bad to worse. “For God’s sake, I<br>implore you, come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole<br>family wretched,” wrote the countess.<br><br>This letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a<br>matter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do.<br><br>The right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate<br>to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his<br>after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious<br>gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when<br>he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavrúshka<br>(Denísov’s servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who<br>turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going<br>home. Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would<br>go away without having heard from the staff—and this interested him<br>extremely—whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the<br>Order of St. Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to think<br>that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the Polish<br>Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses Rostóv had betted<br>he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it<br>seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish<br>Mademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans who had given<br>one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would take place<br>without him—he knew he must go away from this good, bright world to<br>somewhere where everything was stupid and confused. A week later he<br>obtained his leave. His hussar comrades—not only those of his own<br>regiment, but the whole brigade—gave Rostóv a dinner to which the<br>subscription was fifteen rubles a head, and at which there were two<br>bands and two choirs of singers. Rostóv danced the Trepák with Major<br>Básov; the tipsy officers tossed, embraced, and dropped Rostóv; the<br>soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, and shouted “hurrah!”<br>and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first<br>post station.<br><br>During the first half of the journey—from Kremenchúg to Kiev—all<br>Rostóv’s thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with<br>the squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget<br>his three roans and Dozhoyvéyko, his quartermaster, and to wonder<br>anxiously how things would be at Otrádnoe and what he would find<br>there. Thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached it—far<br>stronger, as though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which<br>the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the<br>distance. At the last post station before Otrádnoe he gave the driver a<br>three-ruble tip, and on arriving he ran breathlessly, like a boy, up the<br>steps of his home.<br><br>After the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied<br>expectation—the feeling that “everything is just the same, so why<br>did I hurry?”—Nicholas began to settle down in his old home world.<br>His father and mother were much the same, only a little older. What was<br>new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord, which there<br>used not to be, and which, as Nicholas soon found out, was due to the<br>bad state of their affairs. Sónya was nearly twenty; she had stopped<br>growing prettier and promised nothing more than she was already, but<br>that was enough. She exhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas<br>returned, and the faithful, unalterable love of this girl had a<br>gladdening effect on him. Pétya and Natásha surprised Nicholas<br>most. Pétya was a big handsome boy of thirteen, merry, witty, and<br>mischievous, with a voice that was already breaking. As for Natásha,<br>for a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed whenever he looked at<br>her.<br><br>“You’re not the same at all,” he said.<br><br>“How? Am I uglier?”<br><br>“On the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!” he whispered to<br>her.<br><br>“Yes, yes, yes!” cried Natásha, joyfully.<br><br>She told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit to<br>Otrádnoe and showed him his last letter.<br><br>“Well, are you glad?” Natásha asked. “I am so tranquil and happy<br>now.”<br><br>“Very glad,” answered Nicholas. “He is an excellent fellow.... And<br>are you very much in love?”<br><br>“How shall I put it?” replied Natásha. “I was in love with<br>Borís, with my teacher, and with Denísov, but this is quite different.<br>I feel at peace and settled. I know that no better man than he exists,<br>and I am calm and contented now. Not at all as before.”<br><br>Nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage<br>for a year; but Natásha attacked her brother with exasperation, proving<br>to him that it could not be otherwise, and that it would be a bad thing<br>to enter a family against the father’s will, and that she herself<br>wished it so.<br><br>“You don’t at all understand,” she said.<br><br>Nicholas was silent and agreed with her.<br><br>Her brother often wondered as he looked at her. She did not seem at<br>all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband. She was<br>even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old. This amazed<br>Nicholas and even made him regard Bolkónski’s courtship skeptically.<br>He could not believe that her fate was sealed, especially as he had<br>not seen her with Prince Andrew. It always seemed to him that there was<br>something not quite right about this intended marriage.<br><br>“Why this delay? Why no betrothal?” he thought. Once, when he had<br>touched on this topic with his mother, he discovered, to his surprise<br>and somewhat to his satisfaction, that in the depth of her soul she too<br>had doubts about this marriage.<br><br>“You see he writes,” said she, showing her son a letter of Prince<br>Andrew’s, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a<br>daughter’s future married happiness, “he writes that he won’t come<br>before December. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His health<br>is very delicate. Don’t tell Natásha. And don’t attach importance<br>to her being so bright: that’s because she’s living through the last<br>days of her girlhood, but I know what she is like every time we receive<br>a letter from him! However, God grant that everything turns out well!”<br>(She always ended with these words.) “He is an excellent man!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>After reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull. He was<br>worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business<br>matters for which his mother had called him home. To throw off this<br>burden as quickly as possible, on the third day after his arrival he<br>went, angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he<br>was going, to Mítenka’s lodge and demanded an account of everything.<br>But what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew even less<br>than the frightened and bewildered Mítenka. The conversation and the<br>examination of the accounts with Mítenka did not last long. The village<br>elder, a peasant delegate, and the village clerk, who were waiting in<br>the passage, heard with fear and delight first the young count’s voice<br>roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder, and then words of<br>abuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one after the other.<br><br>“Robber!... Ungrateful wretch!... I’ll hack the dog to pieces! I’m<br>not my father!... Robbing us!...” and so on.<br><br>Then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red in<br>the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged Mítenka out by the scruff of<br>the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility<br>at convenient moments between the words, shouting, “Be off! Never let<br>me see your face here again, you villain!”<br><br>Mítenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the<br>shrubbery. (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for culprits<br>at Otrádnoe. Mítenka himself, returning tipsy from the town, used<br>to hide there, and many of the residents at Otrádnoe, hiding from<br>Mítenka, knew of its protective qualities.)<br><br>Mítenka’s wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and frightened<br>faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and<br>where the steward’s high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt.<br><br>The young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, passed by<br>with resolute strides and went into the house.<br><br>The countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the<br>lodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly<br>improve, but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this<br>excitement might have on her son. She went several times to his door on<br>tiptoe and listened, as he lighted one pipe after another.<br><br>Next day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed<br>smile, said to him:<br><br>“But you know, my dear boy, it’s a pity you got excited! Mítenka<br>has told me all about it.”<br><br>“I knew,” thought Nicholas, “that I should never understand<br>anything in this crazy world.”<br><br>“You were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. But they<br>were carried forward—and you did not look at the other page.”<br><br>“Papa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is! And what I have<br>done, I have done; but, if you like, I won’t speak to him again.”<br><br>“No, my dear boy” (the count, too, felt embarrassed. He knew he had<br>mismanaged his wife’s property and was to blame toward his children,<br>but he did not know how to remedy it). “No, I beg you to attend to the<br>business. I am old. I...”<br><br>“No, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. I<br>understand it all less than you do.”<br><br>“Devil take all these peasants, and money matters, and carryings<br>forward from page to page,” he thought. “I used to understand what<br>a ‘corner’ and the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to<br>another page I don’t understand at all,” said he to himself, and<br>after that he did not meddle in business affairs. But once the countess<br>called her son and informed him that she had a promissory note from Anna<br>Mikháylovna for two thousand rubles, and asked him what he thought of<br>doing with it.<br><br>“This,” answered Nicholas. “You say it rests with me. Well, I<br>don’t like Anna Mikháylovna and I don’t like Borís, but they were<br>our friends and poor. Well then, this!” and he tore up the note, and<br>by so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy. After that,<br>young Rostóv took no further part in any business affairs, but<br>devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new<br>pursuit—the chase—for which his father kept a large establishment.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>The weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed<br>an earth saturated by autumn rains. The verdure had thickened and its<br>bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye<br>trodden down by the cattle, and against the pale-yellow stubble of the<br>spring buckwheat. The wooded ravines and the copses, which at the end of<br>August had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble, had<br>become golden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye. The<br>hares had already half changed their summer coats, the fox cubs were<br>beginning to scatter, and the young wolves were bigger than dogs. It was<br>the best time of the year for the chase. The hounds of that ardent young<br>sportsman Rostóv had not merely reached hard winter condition, but were<br>so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them<br>a three days’ rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, to go on<br>a distant expedition, starting from the oak grove where there was an<br>undisturbed litter of wolf cubs.<br><br>All that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and the air was<br>sharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw.<br>On the fifteenth, when young Rostóv, in his dressing gown, looked out<br>of the window, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting: it<br>was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any<br>wind. The only motion in the air was that of the dripping, microscopic<br>particles of drizzling mist. The bare twigs in the garden were hung with<br>transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves. The earth in<br>the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed<br>and at a short distance merged into the dull, moist veil of mist.<br>Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch. There was a smell of<br>decaying leaves and of dog. Mílka, a black-spotted, broad-haunched<br>bitch with prominent black eyes, got up on seeing her master, stretched<br>her hind legs, lay down like a hare, and then suddenly jumped up and<br>licked him right on his nose and mustache. Another borzoi, a dog,<br>catching sight of his master from the garden path, arched his back<br>and, rushing headlong toward the porch with lifted tail, began rubbing<br>himself against his legs.<br><br>“O-hoy!” came at that moment, that inimitable huntsman’s call<br>which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor, and round<br>the corner came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman, a gray,<br>wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrainian<br>fashion, a long bent whip in his hand, and that look of independence<br>and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen. He doffed his<br>Circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully. This scorn<br>was not offensive to his master. Nicholas knew that this Daniel,<br>disdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them, was all<br>the same his serf and huntsman.<br><br>“Daniel!” Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the<br>weather, the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away<br>by that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all<br>his previous resolutions, as a lover forgets in the presence of his<br>mistress.<br><br>“What orders, your excellency?” said the huntsman in his deep bass,<br>deep as a proto-deacon’s and hoarse with hallooing—and two flashing<br>black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master, who was silent.<br>“Can you resist it?” those eyes seemed to be asking.<br><br>“It’s a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?” asked<br>Nicholas, scratching Mílka behind the ears.<br><br>Daniel did not answer, but winked instead.<br><br>“I sent Uvárka at dawn to listen,” his bass boomed out after a<br>minute’s pause. “He says she’s moved them into the Otrádnoe<br>enclosure. They were howling there.” (This meant that the she-wolf,<br>about whom they both knew, had moved with her cubs to the Otrádnoe<br>copse, a small place a mile and a half from the house.)<br><br>“We ought to go, don’t you think so?” said Nicholas. “Come to me<br>with Uvárka.”<br><br>“As you please.”<br><br>“Then put off feeding them.”<br><br>“Yes, sir.”<br><br>Five minutes later Daniel and Uvárka were standing in Nicholas’ big<br>study. Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room was<br>like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and<br>surroundings of human life. Daniel himself felt this, and as usual stood<br>just inside the door, trying to speak softly and not move, for fear of<br>breaking something in the master’s apartment, and he hastened to say<br>all that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling, out into<br>the open under the sky once more.<br><br>Having finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion that<br>the hounds were fit (Daniel himself wished to go hunting), Nicholas<br>ordered the horses to be saddled. But just as Daniel was about to<br>go Natásha came in with rapid steps, not having done up her hair or<br>finished dressing and with her old nurse’s big shawl wrapped round<br>her. Pétya ran in at the same time.<br><br>“You are going?” asked Natásha. “I knew you would! Sónya said<br>you wouldn’t go, but I knew that today is the sort of day when you<br>couldn’t help going.”<br><br>“Yes, we are going,” replied Nicholas reluctantly, for today, as he<br>intended to hunt seriously, he did not want to take Natásha and Pétya.<br>“We are going, but only wolf hunting: it would be dull for you.”<br><br>“You know it is my greatest pleasure,” said Natásha. “It’s not<br>fair; you are going by yourself, are having the horses saddled and said<br>nothing to us about it.”<br><br>“‘No barrier bars a Russian’s path’—we’ll go!” shouted<br>Pétya.<br><br>“But you can’t. Mamma said you mustn’t,” said Nicholas to<br>Natásha.<br><br>“Yes, I’ll go. I shall certainly go,” said Natásha decisively.<br>“Daniel, tell them to saddle for us, and Michael must come with my<br>dogs,” she added to the huntsman.<br><br>It seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all, but to<br>have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible. He<br>cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business,<br>careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young<br>lady.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>The old count, who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment<br>but had now handed it all completely over to his son’s care, being<br>in very good spirits on this fifteenth of September, prepared to go out<br>with the others.<br><br>In an hour’s time the whole hunting party was at the porch. Nicholas,<br>with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for<br>attending to trifles, went past Natásha and Pétya who were trying to<br>tell him something. He had a look at all the details of the hunt, sent<br>a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry, mounted his<br>chestnut Donéts, and whistling to his own leash of borzois, set off<br>across the threshing ground to a field leading to the Otrádnoe wood.<br>The old count’s horse, a sorrel gelding called Viflyánka, was led by<br>the groom in attendance on him, while the count himself was to drive in<br>a small trap straight to a spot reserved for him.<br><br>They were taking fifty-four hounds, with six hunt attendants and<br>whippers-in. Besides the family, there were eight borzoi kennelmen<br>and more than forty borzois, so that, with the borzois on the leash<br>belonging to members of the family, there were about a hundred and<br>thirty dogs and twenty horsemen.<br><br>Each dog knew its master and its call. Each man in the hunt knew his<br>business, his place, what he had to do. As soon as they had passed the<br>fence they all spread out evenly and quietly, without noise or talk,<br>along the road and field leading to the Otrádnoe covert.<br><br>The horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet, now and then<br>splashing into puddles as they crossed a road. The misty sky still<br>seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth, the air<br>was still, warm, and silent. Occasionally the whistle of a huntsman,<br>the snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the whine of a straggling<br>hound could be heard.<br><br>When they had gone a little less than a mile, five more riders with<br>dogs appeared out of the mist, approaching the Rostóvs. In front rode a<br>fresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray mustache.<br><br>“Good morning, Uncle!” said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.<br><br>“That’s it. Come on!... I was sure of it,” began “Uncle.” (He<br>was a distant relative of the Rostóvs’, a man of small means, and<br>their neighbor.) “I knew you wouldn’t be able to resist it and<br>it’s a good thing you’re going. That’s it! Come on!” (This was<br>“Uncle’s” favorite expression.) “Take the covert at once, for my<br>Gírchik says the Ilágins are at Kornikí with their hounds. That’s<br>it. Come on!... They’ll take the cubs from under your very nose.”<br><br>“That’s where I’m going. Shall we join up our packs?” asked<br>Nicholas.<br><br>The hounds were joined into one pack, and “Uncle” and Nicholas rode<br>on side by side. Natásha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide her<br>eager face and shining eyes, galloped up to them. She was followed by<br>Pétya who always kept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and by a<br>groom appointed to look after her. Pétya, who was laughing, whipped and<br>pulled at his horse. Natásha sat easily and confidently on her black<br>Arábchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand.<br><br>“Uncle” looked round disapprovingly at Pétya and Natásha. He did<br>not like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting.<br><br>“Good morning, Uncle! We are going too!” shouted Pétya.<br><br>“Good morning, good morning! But don’t go overriding the hounds,”<br>said “Uncle” sternly.<br><br>“Nicholas, what a fine dog Truníla is! He knew me,” said Natásha,<br>referring to her favorite hound.<br><br>“In the first place, Truníla is not a ‘dog,’ but a harrier,”<br>thought Nicholas, and looked sternly at his sister, trying to make her<br>feel the distance that ought to separate them at that moment. Natásha<br>understood it.<br><br>“You mustn’t think we’ll be in anyone’s way, Uncle,” she said.<br>“We’ll go to our places and won’t budge.”<br><br>“A good thing too, little countess,” said “Uncle,” “only mind<br>you don’t fall off your horse,” he added, “because—that’s it,<br>come on!—you’ve nothing to hold on to.”<br><br>The oasis of the Otrádnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off,<br>the huntsmen were already nearing it. Rostóv, having finally settled<br>with “Uncle” where they should set on the hounds, and having shown<br>Natásha where she was to stand—a spot where nothing could possibly<br>run out—went round above the ravine.<br><br>“Well, nephew, you’re going for a big wolf,” said “Uncle.”<br>“Mind and don’t let her slip!”<br><br>“That’s as may happen,” answered Rostóv. “Karáy, here!” he<br>shouted, answering “Uncle’s” remark by this call to his borzoi.<br>Karáy was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl, famous for having<br>tackled a big wolf unaided. They all took up their places.<br><br>The old count, knowing his son’s ardor in the hunt, hurried so as not<br>to be late, and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when Count<br>Ilyá Rostóv, cheerful, flushed, and with quivering cheeks, drove up<br>with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him,<br>where a wolf might come out. Having straightened his coat and fastened<br>on his hunting knives and horn, he mounted his good, sleek, well-fed,<br>and comfortable horse, Viflyánka, which was turning gray, like himself.<br>His horses and trap were sent home. Count Ilyá Rostóv, though not at<br>heart a keen sportsman, knew the rules of the hunt well, and rode to<br>the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand, arranged his reins,<br>settled himself in the saddle, and, feeling that he was ready, looked<br>about with a smile.<br><br>Beside him was Simon Chekmár, his personal attendant, an old horseman<br>now somewhat stiff in the saddle. Chekmár held in leash three<br>formidable wolfhounds, who had, however, grown fat like their master<br>and his horse. Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed. Some hundred paces<br>farther along the edge of the wood stood Mítka, the count’s other<br>groom, a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds. Before the hunt, by<br>old custom, the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy, taken<br>a snack, and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux.<br><br>He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. His eyes were<br>rather moist and glittered more than usual, and as he sat in his saddle,<br>wrapped up in his fur coat, he looked like a child taken out for an<br>outing.<br><br>The thin, hollow-cheeked Chekmár, having got everything ready, kept<br>glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for<br>thirty years, and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant<br>chat. A third person rode up circumspectly through the wood (it was<br>plain that he had had a lesson) and stopped behind the count. This<br>person was a gray-bearded old man in a woman’s cloak, with a tall<br>peaked cap on his head. He was the buffoon, who went by a woman’s<br>name, Nastásya Ivánovna.<br><br>“Well, Nastásya Ivánovna!” whispered the count, winking at him.<br>“If you scare away the beast, Daniel’ll give it you!”<br><br>“I know a thing or two myself!” said Nastásya Ivánovna.<br><br>“Hush!” whispered the count and turned to Simon. “Have you seen<br>the young countess?” he asked. “Where is she?”<br><br>“With young Count Peter, by the Zhárov rank grass,” answered Simon,<br>smiling. “Though she’s a lady, she’s very fond of hunting.”<br><br>“And you’re surprised at the way she rides, Simon, eh?” said the<br>count. “She’s as good as many a man!”<br><br>“Of course! It’s marvelous. So bold, so easy!”<br><br>“And Nicholas? Where is he? By the Lyádov upland, isn’t he?”<br><br>“Yes, sir. He knows where to stand. He understands the matter so well<br>that Daniel and I are often quite astounded,” said Simon, well knowing<br>what would please his master.<br><br>“Rides well, eh? And how well he looks on his horse, eh?”<br><br>“A perfect picture! How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the<br>Zavárzinsk thicket the other day! Leaped a fearful place; what a sight<br>when they rushed from the covert... the horse worth a thousand rubles<br>and the rider beyond all price! Yes, one would have to search far to<br>find another as smart.”<br><br>“To search far...” repeated the count, evidently sorry Simon had not<br>said more. “To search far,” he said, turning back the skirt of his<br>coat to get at his snuffbox.<br><br>“The other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform, Michael<br>Sidórych...” Simon did not finish, for on the still air he had<br>distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds<br>giving tongue. He bent down his head and listened, shaking a warning<br>finger at his master. “They are on the scent of the cubs...” he<br>whispered, “straight to the Lyádov uplands.”<br><br>The count, forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face, looked into<br>the distance straight before him, down the narrow open space, holding<br>the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any. After the cry of the hounds<br>came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel’s hunting horn; the<br>pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry,<br>with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after<br>a wolf. The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds, but changed to the<br>cry of ulyulyu, and above the others rose Daniel’s voice, now a deep<br>bass, now piercingly shrill. His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and<br>carried far beyond out into the open field.<br><br>After listening a few moments in silence, the count and his attendant<br>convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs: the<br>sound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue, began to die away in<br>the distance, the other pack rushed by the wood past the count, and<br>it was with this that Daniel’s voice was heard calling ulyulyu.<br>The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again, but both were<br>becoming more distant.<br><br>Simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had<br>entangled; the count too sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in his hand,<br>opened it and took a pinch. “Back!” cried Simon to a borzoi that<br>was pushing forward out of the wood. The count started and dropped the<br>snuffbox. Nastásya Ivánovna dismounted to pick it up. The count and<br>Simon were looking at him.<br><br>Then, unexpectedly, as often happens, the sound of the hunt suddenly<br>approached, as if the hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing were just<br>in front of them.<br><br>The count turned and saw on his right Mítka staring at him with eyes<br>starting out of his head, raising his cap and pointing before him to the<br>other side.<br><br>“Look out!” he shouted, in a voice plainly showing that he had long<br>fretted to utter that word, and letting the borzois slip he galloped<br>toward the count.<br><br>The count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a<br>wolf which, softly swaying from side to side, was coming at a quiet<br>lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing.<br>The angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the<br>horses’ feet at the wolf.<br><br>The wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly,<br>like a man suffering from the quinsy, and, still slightly swaying<br>from side to side, gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail<br>disappeared into the skirt of the wood. At the same instant, with a cry<br>like a wail, first one hound, then another, and then another, sprang<br>helter-skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across<br>the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared. The hazel<br>bushes parted behind the hounds and Daniel’s chestnut horse appeared,<br>dark with sweat. On its long back sat Daniel, hunched forward, capless,<br>his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed, perspiring face.<br><br>“Ulyulyulyu! ulyulyu!...” he cried. When he caught sight of the<br>count his eyes flashed lightning.<br><br>“Blast you!” he shouted, holding up his whip threateningly at the<br>count.<br><br>“You’ve let the wolf go!... What sportsmen!” and as if scorning to<br>say more to the frightened and shamefaced count, he lashed the heaving<br>flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count<br>had aroused and flew off after the hounds. The count, like a punished<br>schoolboy, looked round, trying by a smile to win Simon’s sympathy for<br>his plight. But Simon was no longer there. He was galloping round by the<br>bushes while the field was coming up on both sides, all trying to head<br>the wolf, but it vanished into the wood before they could do so.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>Nicholas Rostóv meanwhile remained at his post, waiting for the wolf.<br>By the way the hunt approached and receded, by the cries of the dogs<br>whose notes were familiar to him, by the way the voices of the huntsmen<br>approached, receded, and rose, he realized what was happening at the<br>copse. He knew that young and old wolves were there, that the hounds had<br>separated into two packs, that somewhere a wolf was being chased, and<br>that something had gone wrong. He expected the wolf to come his way any<br>moment. He made thousands of different conjectures as to where and<br>from what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it. Hope<br>alternated with despair. Several times he addressed a prayer to God<br>that the wolf should come his way. He prayed with that passionate and<br>shamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement<br>arising from trivial causes. “What would it be to Thee to do this for<br>me?” he said to God. “I know Thou art great, and that it is a sin to<br>ask this of Thee, but for God’s sake do let the old wolf come my way<br>and let Karáy spring at it—in sight of ‘Uncle’ who is watching<br>from over there—and seize it by the throat in a death grip!” A<br>thousand times during that half-hour Rostóv cast eager and restless<br>glances over the edge of the wood, with the two scraggy oaks rising<br>above the aspen undergrowth and the gully with its water-worn side and<br>“Uncle’s” cap just visible above the bush on his right.<br><br>“No, I shan’t have such luck,” thought Rostóv, “yet what<br>wouldn’t it be worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards and in<br>war, I am always unlucky.” Memories of Austerlitz and of Dólokhov<br>flashed rapidly and clearly through his mind. “Only once in my life<br>to get an old wolf, I want only that!” thought he, straining eyes and<br>ears and looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the<br>slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs.<br><br>Again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across<br>the deserted field. “No, it can’t be!” thought Rostóv, taking a<br>deep breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for.<br>The height of happiness was reached—and so simply, without warning, or<br>noise, or display, that Rostóv could not believe his eyes and remained<br>in doubt for over a second. The wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over<br>a gully that lay in her path. She was an old animal with a gray back and<br>big reddish belly. She ran without hurry, evidently feeling sure that no<br>one saw her. Rostóv, holding his breath, looked round at the borzois.<br>They stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation.<br>Old Karáy had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas,<br>baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs.<br><br>“Ulyulyulyu!” whispered Rostóv, pouting his lips. The borzois<br>jumped up, jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears.<br>Karáy finished scratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got<br>up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down.<br><br>“Shall I loose them or not?” Nicholas asked himself as the wolf<br>approached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolf’s whole<br>physiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never<br>seen before—human eyes fixed upon her—and turning her head a little<br>toward Rostóv, she paused.<br><br>“Back or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...” the wolf seemed to say<br>to herself, and she moved forward without again looking round and with a<br>quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.<br><br>“Ulyulyu!” cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own<br>accord his good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies<br>to head off the wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still.<br>Nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping, nor<br>see the borzois, nor the ground over which he went: he saw only the<br>wolf, who, increasing her speed, bounded on in the same direction along<br>the hollow. The first to come into view was Mílka, with her black<br>markings and powerful quarters, gaining upon the wolf. Nearer and<br>nearer... now she was ahead of it; but the wolf turned its head to face<br>her, and instead of putting on speed as she usually did Mílka suddenly<br>raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs.<br><br>“Ulyulyulyulyu!” shouted Nicholas.<br><br>The reddish Lyubím rushed forward from behind Mílka, sprang<br>impetuously at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but<br>immediately jumped aside in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed her<br>teeth, and again rose and bounded forward, followed at the distance of a<br>couple of feet by all the borzois, who did not get any closer to her.<br><br>“She’ll get away! No, it’s impossible!” thought Nicholas, still<br>shouting with a hoarse voice.<br><br>“Karáy, ulyulyu!...” he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi<br>who was now his only hope. Karáy, with all the strength age had left<br>him, stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf, galloped<br>heavily aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the wolf’s<br>lope and the borzoi’s slower pace made it plain that Karáy had<br>miscalculated. Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the<br>wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it. But,<br>coming toward him, he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost<br>straight at the wolf. There was still hope. A long, yellowish<br>young borzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from another leash, rushed<br>impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over. But<br>the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and,<br>gnashing her teeth, flew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with a piercing<br>yelp, fell with its head on the ground, bleeding from a gash in its<br>side.<br><br>“Karáy? Old fellow!...” wailed Nicholas.<br><br>Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf’s path, the<br>old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five<br>paces of it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her eyes on<br>Karáy, tucked her tail yet further between her legs, and increased<br>her speed. But here Nicholas only saw that something happened to<br>Karáy—the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf, and they rolled together<br>down into a gully just in front of them.<br><br>That instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully<br>with the dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and<br>outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears<br>laid back (Karáy was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest<br>moment of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to<br>dismount and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up from<br>among that mass of dogs, and then her forepaws were on the edge of the<br>gully. She clicked her teeth (Karáy no longer had her by the throat),<br>leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully, and having<br>disengaged herself from the dogs, with tail tucked in again, went<br>forward. Karáy, his hair bristling, and probably bruised or wounded,<br>climbed with difficulty out of the gully.<br><br>“Oh my God! Why?” Nicholas cried in despair.<br><br>“Uncle’s” huntsman was galloping from the other side across the<br>wolf’s path and his borzois once more stopped the animal’s advance.<br>She was again hemmed in.<br><br>Nicholas and his attendant, with “Uncle” and his huntsman, were all<br>riding round the wolf, crying “ulyulyu!” shouting and preparing to<br>dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward<br>again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she<br>would be safe.<br><br>Already, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the ulyulyuing,<br>had rushed out from the wood. He saw Karáy seize the wolf, and checked<br>his horse, supposing the affair to be over. But when he saw that the<br>horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for<br>safety, Daniel set his chestnut galloping, not at the wolf but straight<br>toward the wood, just as Karáy had run to cut the animal off. As<br>a result of this, he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been<br>stopped a second time by “Uncle’s” borzois.<br><br>Daniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand and<br>thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if<br>it were a flail.<br><br>Nicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut, breathing<br>heavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a body and saw Daniel<br>lying on the wolf’s back among the dogs, trying to seize her by the<br>ears. It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to the wolf herself<br>that all was now over. The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and<br>tried to rise, but the borzois stuck to her. Daniel rose a little, took<br>a step, and with his whole weight, as if lying down to rest, fell on<br>the wolf, seizing her by the ears. Nicholas was about to stab her, but<br>Daniel whispered, “Don’t! We’ll gag her!” and, changing his<br>position, set his foot on the wolf’s neck. A stick was thrust between<br>her jaws and she was fastened with a leash, as if bridled, her legs were<br>bound together, and Daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to<br>side.<br><br>With happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a shying<br>and snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her, took her<br>to the place where they were all to meet. The hounds had killed two of<br>the cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen assembled with their booty<br>and their stories, and all came to look at the wolf, which, with her<br>broad-browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws,<br>gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding<br>her. When she was touched, she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly<br>yet simply at everybody. Old Count Rostóv also rode up and touched the<br>wolf.<br><br>“Oh, what a formidable one!” said he. “A formidable one, eh?” he<br>asked Daniel, who was standing near.<br><br>“Yes, your excellency,” answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap.<br><br>The count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with<br>Daniel.<br><br>“Ah, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!” said the count.<br><br>For sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and amiable<br>smile.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>The old count went home, and Natásha and Pétya promised to return very<br>soon, but as it was still early the hunt went farther. At midday<br>they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees.<br>Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips.<br><br>Facing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood alone<br>in a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been loosed<br>before Nicholas heard one he knew, Voltórn, giving tongue at intervals;<br>other hounds joined in, now pausing and now again giving tongue. A<br>moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been<br>found, and the whole pack, joining together, rushed along the ravine<br>toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas.<br><br>He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the<br>ravine, he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself<br>at any moment on the ryefield opposite.<br><br>The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois, and<br>Nicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard<br>across the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew close<br>to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper<br>curves, trailing its brush, when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed<br>in followed by a black one, and everything was in confusion; the borzois<br>formed a star-shaped figure, scarcely swaying their bodies and with<br>tails turned away from the center of the group. Two huntsmen galloped up<br>to the dogs; one in a red cap, the other, a stranger, in a green coat.<br><br>“What’s this?” thought Nicholas. “Where’s that huntsman from?<br>He is not ‘Uncle’s’ man.”<br><br>The huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without strapping<br>it to the saddle. Their horses, bridled and with high saddles, stood<br>near them and there too the dogs were lying. The huntsmen waved their<br>arms and did something to the fox. Then from that spot came the sound of<br>a horn, with the signal agreed on in case of a fight.<br><br>“That’s Ilágin’s huntsman having a row with our Iván,” said<br>Nicholas’ groom.<br><br>Nicholas sent the man to call Natásha and Pétya to him, and rode at a<br>footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together.<br>Several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on.<br><br>Nicholas dismounted, and with Natásha and Pétya, who had ridden up,<br>stopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter would end. Out of<br>the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward<br>his young master, with the fox tied to his crupper. While still at a<br>distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully, but he was<br>pale and breathless and his face was angry. One of his eyes was black,<br>but he probably was not even aware of it.<br><br>“What has happened?” asked Nicholas.<br><br>“A likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And it was my gray<br>bitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... He snatches at the fox! I<br>gave him one with the fox. Here it is on my saddle! Do you want a taste<br>of this?...” said the huntsman, pointing to his dagger and probably<br>imagining himself still speaking to his foe.<br><br>Nicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister and Pétya<br>to wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy’s, Ilágin’s,<br>hunting party was.<br><br>The victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there,<br>surrounded by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.<br><br>The facts were that Ilágin, with whom the Rostóvs had a quarrel and<br>were at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to the Rostóvs,<br>and had now, as if purposely, sent his men to the very woods the<br>Rostóvs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had<br>chased.<br><br>Nicholas, though he had never seen Ilágin, with his usual absence<br>of moderation in judgment, hated him cordially from reports of his<br>arbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest foe. He<br>rode in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and fully<br>prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his<br>enemy.<br><br>Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in<br>a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black horse,<br>accompanied by two hunt servants.<br><br>Instead of an enemy, Nicholas found in Ilágin a stately and courteous<br>gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young count’s<br>acquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, Ilágin raised his beaver<br>cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the<br>man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone<br>else’s borzois. He hoped to become better acquainted with the count<br>and invited him to draw his covert.<br><br>Natásha, afraid that her brother would do something dreadful, had<br>followed him in some excitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging friendly<br>greetings, she rode up to them. Ilágin lifted his beaver cap still<br>higher to Natásha and said, with a pleasant smile, that the young<br>countess resembled Diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her<br>beauty, of which he had heard much.<br><br>To expiate his huntsman’s offense, Ilágin pressed the Rostóvs to<br>come to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for<br>himself and which, he said, swarmed with hares. Nicholas agreed, and the<br>hunt, now doubled, moved on.<br><br>The way to Iligin’s upland was across the fields. The hunt servants<br>fell into line. The masters rode together. “Uncle,” Rostóv, and<br>Ilágin kept stealthily glancing at one another’s dogs, trying not<br>to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to<br>their own borzois.<br><br>Rostóv was particularly struck by the beauty of a small, pure-bred,<br>red-spotted bitch on Ilágin’s leash, slender but with muscles like<br>steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He had heard of<br>the swiftness of Ilágin’s borzois, and in that beautiful bitch saw a<br>rival to his own Mílka.<br><br>In the middle of a sober conversation begun by Ilágin about the<br>year’s harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.<br><br>“A fine little bitch, that!” said he in a careless tone. “Is she<br>swift?”<br><br>“That one? Yes, she’s a good dog, gets what she’s after,”<br>answered Ilágin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erzá, for<br>which, a year before, he had given a neighbor three families of house<br>serfs. “So in your parts, too, the harvest is nothing to boast of,<br>Count?” he went on, continuing the conversation they had begun. And<br>considering it polite to return the young count’s compliment, Ilágin<br>looked at his borzois and picked out Mílka who attracted his attention<br>by her breadth. “That black-spotted one of yours is fine—well<br>shaped!” said he.<br><br>“Yes, she’s fast enough,” replied Nicholas, and thought: “If<br>only a full-grown hare would cross the field now I’d show you what<br>sort of borzoi she is,” and turning to his groom, he said he would<br>give a ruble to anyone who found a hare.<br><br>“I don’t understand,” continued Ilágin, “how some sportsmen can<br>be so jealous about game and dogs. For myself, I can tell you, Count,<br>I enjoy riding in company such as this... what could be better?” (he<br>again raised his cap to Natásha) “but as for counting skins and what<br>one takes, I don’t care about that.”<br><br>“Of course not!”<br><br>“Or being upset because someone else’s borzoi and not mine catches<br>something. All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it not so,<br>Count? For I consider that...”<br><br>“A-tu!” came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in,<br>who had halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his whip<br>aloft, and again repeated his long-drawn cry, “A-tu!” (This call and<br>the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare.)<br><br>“Ah, he has found one, I think,” said Ilágin carelessly. “Yes, we<br>must ride up.... Shall we both course it?” answered Nicholas, seeing<br>in Erzá and “Uncle’s” red Rugáy two rivals he had never yet had<br>a chance of pitting against his own borzois. “And suppose they outdo<br>my Mílka at once!” he thought as he rode with “Uncle” and Ilágin<br>toward the hare.<br><br>“A full-grown one?” asked Ilágin as he approached the whip who<br>had sighted the hare—and not without agitation he looked round and<br>whistled to Erzá.<br><br>“And you, Michael Nikanórovich?” he said, addressing “Uncle.”<br><br>The latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face.<br><br>“How can I join in? Why, you’ve given a village for each of your<br>borzois! That’s it, come on! Yours are worth thousands. Try yours<br>against one another, you two, and I’ll look on!”<br><br>“Rugáy, hey, hey!” he shouted. “Rugáyushka!” he added,<br>involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes<br>he placed on this red borzoi. Natásha saw and felt the agitation the<br>two elderly men and her brother were trying to conceal, and was herself<br>excited by it.<br><br>The huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the<br>gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were far off<br>on the horizon turned away from the hare, and the whips, but not the<br>gentlefolk, also moved away. All were moving slowly and sedately.<br><br>“How is it pointing?” asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces toward<br>the whip who had sighted the hare.<br><br>But before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost coming<br>next morning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack on leash rushed<br>downhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the borzois that<br>were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare. All the hunt,<br>who had been moving slowly, shouted, “Stop!” calling in the hounds,<br>while the borzoi whips, with a cry of “A-tu!” galloped across the<br>field setting the borzois on the hare. The tranquil Ilágin, Nicholas,<br>Natásha, and “Uncle” flew, reckless of where and how they went,<br>seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even<br>for an instant of the chase. The hare they had started was a strong and<br>swift one. When he jumped up he did not run at once, but pricked his<br>ears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all<br>sides at once. He took a dozen bounds, not very quickly, letting the<br>borzois gain on him, and, finally having chosen his direction and<br>realized his danger, laid back his ears and rushed off headlong. He had<br>been lying in the stubble, but in front of him was the autumn sowing<br>where the ground was soft. The two borzois of the huntsman who had<br>sighted him, having been the nearest, were the first to see and pursue<br>him, but they had not gone far before Ilágin’s red-spotted Erzá<br>passed them, got within a length, flew at the hare with terrible<br>swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking she had seized him, rolled<br>over like a ball. The hare arched his back and bounded off yet more<br>swiftly. From behind Erzá rushed the broad-haunched, black-spotted<br>Mílka and began rapidly gaining on the hare.<br><br>“Miláshka, dear!” rose Nicholas’ triumphant cry. It looked as if<br>Mílka would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and<br>flew past. The hare had squatted. Again the beautiful Erzá reached him,<br>but when close to the hare’s scut paused as if measuring the distance,<br>so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg.<br><br>“Erzá, darling!” Ilágin wailed in a voice unlike his own. Erzá<br>did not hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she would have<br>seized her prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between the<br>winter rye and the stubble. Again Erzá and Mílka were abreast, running<br>like a pair of carriage horses, and began to overtake the hare, but<br>it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not<br>overtake him so quickly.<br><br>“Rugáy, Rugáyushka! That’s it, come on!” came a third voice just<br>then, and “Uncle’s” red borzoi, straining and curving its back,<br>caught up with the two foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless<br>of the terrible strain, put on speed close to the hare, knocked it off<br>the balk onto the ryefield, again put on speed still more viciously,<br>sinking to his knees in the muddy field, and all one could see was<br>how, muddying his back, he rolled over with the hare. A ring of borzois<br>surrounded him. A moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd<br>of dogs. Only the delighted “Uncle” dismounted, and cut off a pad,<br>shaking the hare for the blood to drip off, and anxiously glancing round<br>with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched. He spoke without<br>himself knowing whom to or what about. “That’s it, come on! That’s<br>a dog!... There, it has beaten them all, the thousand-ruble as well as<br>the one-ruble borzois. That’s it, come on!” said he, panting and<br>looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone, as if they<br>were all his enemies and had insulted him, and only now had he at<br>last succeeded in justifying himself. “There are your thousand-ruble<br>ones.... That’s it, come on!...”<br><br>“Rugáy, here’s a pad for you!” he said, throwing down the<br>hare’s muddy pad. “You’ve deserved it, that’s it, come on!”<br><br>“She’d tired herself out, she’d run it down three times by<br>herself,” said Nicholas, also not listening to anyone and regardless<br>of whether he were heard or not.<br><br>“But what is there in running across it like that?” said Ilágin’s<br>groom.<br><br>“Once she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take<br>it,” Ilágin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop<br>and his excitement. At the same moment Natásha, without drawing<br>breath, screamed joyously, ecstatically, and so piercingly that it set<br>everyone’s ear tingling. By that shriek she expressed what the others<br>expressed by all talking at once, and it was so strange that she must<br>herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have<br>been amazed at it at any other time. “Uncle” himself twisted up the<br>hare, threw it neatly and smartly across his horse’s back as if by<br>that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody, and, with an air of not<br>wishing to speak to anyone, mounted his bay and rode off. The others all<br>followed, dispirited and shamefaced, and only much later were they able<br>to regain their former affectation of indifference. For a long time they<br>continued to look at red Rugáy who, his arched back spattered with<br>mud and clanking the ring of his leash, walked along just behind<br>“Uncle’s” horse with the serene air of a conqueror.<br><br>“Well, I am like any other dog as long as it’s not a question of<br>coursing. But when it is, then look out!” his appearance seemed to<br>Nicholas to be saying.<br><br>When, much later, “Uncle” rode up to Nicholas and began talking<br>to him, he felt flattered that, after what had happened, “Uncle”<br>deigned to speak to him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>Toward evening Ilágin took leave of Nicholas, who found that they were<br>so far from home that he accepted “Uncle’s” offer that the hunting<br>party should spend the night in his little village of Mikháylovna.<br><br>“And if you put up at my house that will be better still. That’s it,<br>come on!” said “Uncle.” “You see it’s damp weather, and you<br>could rest, and the little countess could be driven home in a trap.”<br><br>“Uncle’s” offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to Otrádnoe for<br>a trap, while Nicholas rode with Natásha and Pétya to “Uncle’s”<br>house.<br><br>Some five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out to the front<br>porch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, old and young, as<br>well as children, popped out from the back entrance to have a look at<br>the hunters who were arriving. The presence of Natásha—a woman, a<br>lady, and on horseback—raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a<br>degree that many of them came up to her, stared her in the face, and<br>unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some<br>prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what<br>was said about her.<br><br>“Arínka! Look, she sits sideways! There she sits and her skirt<br>dangles.... See, she’s got a little hunting horn!”<br><br>“Goodness gracious! See her knife?...”<br><br>“Isn’t she a Tartar!”<br><br>“How is it you didn’t go head over heels?” asked the boldest of<br>all, addressing Natásha directly.<br><br>“Uncle” dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which<br>stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and, after a glance at his<br>retainers, shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take<br>themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to<br>receive the guests and the visitors.<br><br>The serfs all dispersed. “Uncle” lifted Natásha off her horse and<br>taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch. The<br>house, with its bare, unplastered log walls, was not overclean—it<br>did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless—but<br>neither was it noticeably neglected. In the entry there was a smell of<br>fresh apples, and wolf and fox skins hung about.<br><br>“Uncle” led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with<br>a folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a round<br>birchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room where<br>there was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of Suvórov, of<br>the host’s father and mother, and of himself in military uniform. The<br>study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs. “Uncle” asked his visitors<br>to sit down and make themselves at home, and then went out of the room.<br>Rugáy, his back still muddy, came into the room and lay down on the<br>sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth. Leading from the study<br>was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be<br>seen. From behind this came women’s laughter and whispers. Natásha,<br>Nicholas, and Pétya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa.<br>Pétya, leaning on his elbow, fell asleep at once. Natásha and Nicholas<br>were silent. Their faces glowed, they were hungry and very cheerful.<br>They looked at one another (now that the hunt was over and they were in<br>the house, Nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly<br>superiority over his sister), Natásha gave him a wink, and neither<br>refrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before<br>they had a pretext ready to account for it.<br><br>After a while “Uncle” came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and<br>small top boots. And Natásha felt that this costume, the very one she<br>had regarded with surprise and amusement at Otrádnoe, was just the<br>right thing and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat.<br>“Uncle” too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the<br>brother’s and sister’s laughter (it could never enter his head that<br>they might be laughing at his way of life) he himself joined in the<br>merriment.<br><br>“That’s right, young countess, that’s it, come on! I never saw<br>anyone like her!” said he, offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem<br>and, with a practiced motion of three fingers, taking down another that<br>had been cut short. “She’s ridden all day like a man, and is as<br>fresh as ever!”<br><br>Soon after “Uncle’s” reappearance the door was opened, evidently<br>from the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking<br>woman of about forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered<br>carrying a large loaded tray. With hospitable dignity and cordiality in<br>her glance and in every motion, she looked at the visitors and, with<br>a pleasant smile, bowed respectfully. In spite of her exceptional<br>stoutness, which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw<br>back her head, this woman (who was “Uncle’s” housekeeper) trod<br>very lightly. She went to the table, set down the tray, and with her<br>plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors<br>d’oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the table. When she had<br>finished, she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on her<br>face. “Here I am. I am she! Now do you understand ‘Uncle’?” her<br>expression said to Rostóv. How could one help understanding? Not only<br>Nicholas, but even Natásha understood the meaning of his puckered brow<br>and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips when<br>Anísya Fëdorovna entered. On the tray was a bottle of herb wine,<br>different kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms, rye cakes made with<br>buttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead and sparkling mead, apples,<br>nuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey sweets. Afterwards she brought<br>a freshly roasted chicken, ham, preserves made with honey, and preserves<br>made with sugar.<br><br>All this was the fruit of Anísya Fëdorovna’s housekeeping, gathered<br>and prepared by her. The smell and taste of it all had a smack<br>of Anísya Fëdorovna herself: a savor of juiciness, cleanliness,<br>whiteness, and pleasant smiles.<br><br>“Take this, little Lady-Countess!” she kept saying, as she offered<br>Natásha first one thing and then another.<br><br>Natásha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such<br>buttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets, or such<br>a chicken anywhere. Anísya Fëdorovna left the room.<br><br>After supper, over their cherry brandy, Rostóv and “Uncle” talked<br>of past and future hunts, of Rugáy and Ilágin’s dogs, while Natásha<br>sat upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes. She tried<br>several times to wake Pétya that he might eat something, but he<br>only muttered incoherent words without waking up. Natásha felt so<br>lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared<br>the trap would come for her too soon. After a casual pause, such as<br>often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in one’s own<br>house, “Uncle,” answering a thought that was in his visitors’<br>minds, said:<br><br>“This, you see, is how I am finishing my days... Death will come.<br>That’s it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm anyone?”<br><br>“Uncle’s” face was very significant and even handsome as he said<br>this. Involuntarily Rostóv recalled all the good he had heard about<br>him from his father and the neighbors. Throughout the whole province<br>“Uncle” had the reputation of being the most honorable and<br>disinterested of cranks. They called him in to decide family disputes,<br>chose him as executor, confided secrets to him, elected him to be a<br>justice and to other posts; but he always persistently refused public<br>appointments, passing the autumn and spring in the fields on his bay<br>gelding, sitting at home in winter, and lying in his overgrown garden in<br>summer.<br><br>“Why don’t you enter the service, Uncle?”<br><br>“I did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. That’s it, come<br>on! I can’t make head or tail of it. That’s for you—I haven’t<br>brains enough. Now, hunting is another matter—that’s it, come on!<br>Open the door, there!” he shouted. “Why have you shut it?”<br><br>The door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen’s room, as they<br>called the room for the hunt servants.<br><br>There was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand opened the<br>door into the huntsmen’s room, from which came the clear sounds of a<br>balaláyka on which someone, who was evidently a master of the art, was<br>playing. Natásha had been listening to those strains for some time and<br>now went out into the passage to hear better.<br><br>“That’s Mítka, my coachman.... I have got him a good balaláyka.<br>I’m fond of it,” said “Uncle.”<br><br>It was the custom for Mítka to play the balaláyka in the huntsmen’s<br>room when “Uncle” returned from the chase. “Uncle” was fond of<br>such music.<br><br>“How good! Really very good!” said Nicholas with some unintentional<br>superciliousness, as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him<br>very much.<br><br>“Very good?” said Natásha reproachfully, noticing her brother’s<br>tone. “Not ‘very good’ it’s simply delicious!”<br><br>Just as “Uncle’s” pickled mushrooms, honey, and cherry brandy had<br>seemed to her the best in the world, so also that song, at that moment,<br>seemed to her the acme of musical delight.<br><br>“More, please, more!” cried Natásha at the door as soon as the<br>balaláyka ceased. Mítka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming<br>the balaláyka to the air of My Lady, with trills and variations.<br>“Uncle” sat listening, slightly smiling, with his head on one side.<br>The air was repeated a hundred times. The balaláyka was retuned several<br>times and the same notes were thrummed again, but the listeners did<br>not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again. Anísya<br>Fëdorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost.<br><br>“You like listening?” she said to Natásha, with a smile extremely<br>like “Uncle’s.” “That’s a good player of ours,” she added.<br><br>“He doesn’t play that part right!” said “Uncle” suddenly, with<br>an energetic gesture. “Here he ought to burst out—that’s it, come<br>on!—ought to burst out.”<br><br>“Do you play then?” asked Natásha.<br><br>“Uncle” did not answer, but smiled.<br><br>“Anísya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right. I<br>haven’t touched it for a long time. That’s it—come on! I’ve<br>given it up.”<br><br>Anísya Fëdorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill her<br>errand and brought back the guitar.<br><br>Without looking at anyone, “Uncle” blew the dust off it and, tapping<br>the case with his bony fingers, tuned the guitar and settled himself in<br>his armchair. He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard, arching<br>his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a wink at<br>Anísya Fëdorovna, struck a single chord, pure and sonorous, and then<br>quietly, smoothly, and confidently began playing in very slow time, not<br>My Lady, but the well-known song: Came a maiden down the street. The<br>tune, played with precision and in exact time, began to thrill in the<br>hearts of Nicholas and Natásha, arousing in them the same kind of<br>sober mirth as radiated from Anísya Fëdorovna’s whole being. Anísya<br>Fëdorovna flushed, and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing<br>out of the room. “Uncle” continued to play correctly, carefully,<br>with energetic firmness, looking with a changed and inspired expression<br>at the spot where Anísya Fëdorovna had just stood. Something seemed to<br>be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches,<br>especially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when, here<br>and there, as he ran his fingers over the strings, something seemed to<br>snap.<br><br>“Lovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!” shouted Natásha as soon as<br>he had finished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed him. “Nicholas,<br>Nicholas!” she said, turning to her brother, as if asking him: “What<br>is it moves me so?”<br><br>Nicholas too was greatly pleased by “Uncle’s” playing, and<br>“Uncle” played the piece over again. Anísya Fëdorovna’s smiling<br>face reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces...<br><br>    Fetching water clear and sweet,<br>    Stop, dear maiden, I entreat—<br><br>played “Uncle” once more, running his fingers skillfully over the<br>strings, and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders.<br><br>“Go on, Uncle dear,” Natásha wailed in an imploring tone as if her<br>life depended on it.<br><br>“Uncle” rose, and it was as if there were two men in him: one of<br>them smiled seriously at the merry fellow, while the merry fellow struck<br>a naïve and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance.<br><br>“Now then, niece!” he exclaimed, waving to Natásha the hand that<br>had just struck a chord.<br><br>Natásha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran forward to face<br>“Uncle,” and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her<br>shoulders and struck an attitude.<br><br>Where, how, and when had this young countess, educated by an émigrée<br>French governess, imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that spirit<br>and obtained that manner which the pas de châle * would, one would have<br>supposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit and the movements were<br>those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that “Uncle” had<br>expected of her. As soon as she had struck her pose, and smiled<br>triumphantly, proudly, and with sly merriment, the fear that had at<br>first seized Nicholas and the others that she might not do the right<br>thing was at an end, and they were already admiring her.<br><br>    * The French shawl dance.<br><br>She did the right thing with such precision, such complete precision,<br>that Anísya Fëdorovna, who had at once handed her the handkerchief she<br>needed for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though she laughed as she<br>watched this slim, graceful countess, reared in silks and velvets and so<br>different from herself, who yet was able to understand all that was<br>in Anísya and in Anísya’s father and mother and aunt, and in every<br>Russian man and woman.<br><br>“Well, little countess; that’s it—come on!” cried “Uncle,”<br>with a joyous laugh, having finished the dance. “Well done, niece! Now<br>a fine young fellow must be found as husband for you. That’s it—come<br>on!”<br><br>“He’s chosen already,” said Nicholas smiling.<br><br>“Oh?” said “Uncle” in surprise, looking inquiringly at Natásha,<br>who nodded her head with a happy smile.<br><br>“And such a one!” she said. But as soon as she had said it a new<br>train of thoughts and feelings arose in her. “What did Nicholas’<br>smile mean when he said ‘chosen already’? Is he glad of it or not?<br>It is as if he thought my Bolkónski would not approve of or understand<br>our gaiety. But he would understand it all. Where is he now?” she<br>thought, and her face suddenly became serious. But this lasted only a<br>second. “Don’t dare to think about it,” she said to herself,<br>and sat down again smilingly beside “Uncle,” begging him to play<br>something more.<br><br>“Uncle” played another song and a valse; then after a pause he<br>cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song:<br><br>    As ‘twas growing dark last night<br>    Fell the snow so soft and light...<br><br>“Uncle” sang as peasants sing, with full and naïve conviction that<br>the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes<br>of itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune, which exists<br>only to give measure to the words. As a result of this the unconsidered<br>tune, like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily good. Natásha was in<br>ecstasies over “Uncle’s” singing. She resolved to give up learning<br>the harp and to play only the guitar. She asked “Uncle” for his<br>guitar and at once found the chords of the song.<br><br>After nine o’clock two traps and three mounted men, who had been sent<br>to look for them, arrived to fetch Natásha and Pétya. The count and<br>countess did not know where they were and were very anxious, said one of<br>the men.<br><br>Pétya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two<br>traps. Natásha and Nicholas got into the other. “Uncle” wrapped<br>Natásha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness. He<br>accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed,<br>so that they had to go round by the ford, and he sent huntsmen to ride<br>in front with lanterns.<br><br>“Good-by, dear niece,” his voice called out of the darkness—not<br>the voice Natásha had known previously, but the one that had sung As<br>‘twas growing dark last night.<br><br>In the village through which they passed there were red lights and a<br>cheerful smell of smoke.<br><br>“What a darling Uncle is!” said Natásha, when they had come out<br>onto the highroad.<br><br>“Yes,” returned Nicholas. “You’re not cold?”<br><br>“No. I’m quite, quite all right. I feel so comfortable!” answered<br>Natásha, almost perplexed by her feelings. They remained silent a long<br>while. The night was dark and damp. They could not see the horses, but<br>only heard them splashing through the unseen mud.<br><br>What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught<br>and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life? How did they all<br>find place in her? But she was very happy. As they were nearing home she<br>suddenly struck up the air of As ‘twas growing dark last night—the<br>tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last<br>caught.<br><br>“Got it?” said Nicholas.<br><br>“What were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?” inquired<br>Natásha.<br><br>They were fond of asking one another that question.<br><br>“I?” said Nicholas, trying to remember. “Well, you see, first I<br>thought that Rugáy, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were<br>a man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then<br>for his manner. What a good fellow Uncle is! Don’t you think so?...<br>Well, and you?”<br><br>“I? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we are driving<br>along and imagining that we are going home, but that heaven knows<br>where we are really going in the darkness, and that we shall arrive and<br>suddenly find that we are not in Otrádnoe, but in Fairyland. And then I<br>thought... No, nothing else.”<br><br>“I know, I expect you thought of him,” said Nicholas, smiling as<br>Natásha knew by the sound of his voice.<br><br>“No,” said Natásha, though she had in reality been thinking about<br>Prince Andrew at the same time as of the rest, and of how he would<br>have liked “Uncle.” “And then I was saying to myself all the way,<br>‘How well Anísya carried herself, how well!’” And Nicholas heard<br>her spontaneous, happy, ringing laughter. “And do you know,” she<br>suddenly said, “I know that I shall never again be as happy and<br>tranquil as I am now.”<br><br>“Rubbish, nonsense, humbug!” exclaimed Nicholas, and he thought:<br>“How charming this Natásha of mine is! I have no other friend like<br>her and never shall have. Why should she marry? We might always drive<br>about together!”<br><br>“What a darling this Nicholas of mine is!” thought Natásha.<br><br>“Ah, there are still lights in the drawing room!” she said, pointing<br>to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety<br>darkness of the night.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>Count Ilyá Rostóv had resigned the position of Marshal of the Nobility<br>because it involved him in too much expense, but still his affairs<br>did not improve. Natásha and Nicholas often noticed their parents<br>conferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of<br>selling the fine ancestral Rostóv house and estate near Moscow. It was<br>not necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been Marshal,<br>and life at Otrádnoe was quieter than in former years, but still the<br>enormous house and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty<br>sat down to table every day. These were all their own people who had<br>settled down in the house almost as members of the family, or persons<br>who were, it seemed, obliged to live in the count’s house. Such were<br>Dimmler the musician and his wife, Vogel the dancing master and his<br>family, Belóva, an old maiden lady, an inmate of the house, and many<br>others such as Pétya’s tutors, the girls’ former governess, and<br>other people who simply found it preferable and more advantageous to<br>live in the count’s house than at home. They had not as many visitors<br>as before, but the old habits of life without which the count and<br>countess could not conceive of existence remained unchanged. There was<br>still the hunting establishment which Nicholas had even enlarged, the<br>same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables, the same expensive<br>presents and dinner parties to the whole district on name days; there<br>were still the count’s games of whist and boston, at which—spreading<br>out his cards so that everybody could see them—he let himself be<br>plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors, who looked<br>upon an opportunity to play a rubber with Count Rostóv as a most<br>profitable source of income.<br><br>The count moved in his affairs as in a huge net, trying not to believe<br>that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step, and<br>feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and<br>patiently to disentangle them. The countess, with her loving heart, felt<br>that her children were being ruined, that it was not the count’s fault<br>for he could not help being what he was—that (though he tried to<br>hide it) he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and<br>his children’s ruin, and she tried to find means of remedying the<br>position. From her feminine point of view she could see only one<br>solution, namely, for Nicholas to marry a rich heiress. She felt this to<br>be their last hope and that if Nicholas refused the match she had found<br>for him, she would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters<br>right. This match was with Julie Karágina, the daughter of excellent<br>and virtuous parents, a girl the Rostóvs had known from childhood, and<br>who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of<br>her brothers.<br><br>The countess had written direct to Julie’s mother in Moscow suggesting<br>a marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer<br>from her. Karágina had replied that for her part she was agreeable, and<br>everything depend on her daughter’s inclination. She invited Nicholas<br>to come to Moscow.<br><br>Several times the countess, with tears in her eyes, told her son that<br>now both her daughters were settled, her only wish was to see him<br>married. She said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that<br>were accomplished. Then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl<br>and tried to discover what he thought about marriage.<br><br>At other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to<br>Moscow during the holidays to amuse himself. Nicholas guessed what his<br>mother’s remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations<br>induced her to speak quite frankly. She told him that her only hope<br>of getting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying Julie<br>Karágina.<br><br>“But, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune, would<br>you expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of<br>money?” he asked his mother, not realizing the cruelty of his question<br>and only wishing to show his noble-mindedness.<br><br>“No, you have not understood me,” said his mother, not knowing how<br>to justify herself. “You have not understood me, Nikólenka. It is<br>your happiness I wish for,” she added, feeling that she was telling an<br>untruth and was becoming entangled. She began to cry.<br><br>“Mamma, don’t cry! Only tell me that you wish it, and you know I<br>will give my life, anything, to put you at ease,” said Nicholas. “I<br>would sacrifice anything for you—even my feelings.”<br><br>But the countess did not want the question put like that: she did not<br>want a sacrifice from her son, she herself wished to make a sacrifice<br>for him.<br><br>“No, you have not understood me, don’t let us talk about it,” she<br>replied, wiping away her tears.<br><br>“Maybe I do love a poor girl,” said Nicholas to himself. “Am I to<br>sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money? I wonder how Mamma could<br>speak so to me. Because Sónya is poor I must not love her,” he<br>thought, “must not respond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I should<br>certainly be happier with her than with some doll-like Julie. I can<br>always sacrifice my feelings for my family’s welfare,” he said to<br>himself, “but I can’t coerce my feelings. If I love Sónya, that<br>feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else.”<br><br>Nicholas did not go to Moscow, and the countess did not renew the<br>conversation with him about marriage. She saw with sorrow, and sometimes<br>with exasperation, symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and<br>the portionless Sónya. Though she blamed herself for it, she could<br>not refrain from grumbling at and worrying Sónya, often pulling her up<br>without reason, addressing her stiffly as “my dear,” and using the<br>formal “you” instead of the intimate “thou” in speaking to her.<br>The kindhearted countess was the more vexed with Sónya because that<br>poor, dark-eyed niece of hers was so meek, so kind, so devotedly<br>grateful to her benefactors, and so faithfully, unchangingly, and<br>unselfishly in love with Nicholas, that there were no grounds for<br>finding fault with her.<br><br>Nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home. A fourth letter had<br>come from Prince Andrew, from Rome, in which he wrote that he would have<br>been on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly<br>reopened in the warm climate, which obliged him to defer his return till<br>the beginning of the new year. Natásha was still as much in love with<br>her betrothed, found the same comfort in that love, and was still as<br>ready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before; but at<br>the end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits<br>of depression which she could not master. She felt sorry for herself:<br>sorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to<br>anyone—while she felt herself so capable of loving and being loved.<br><br>Things were not cheerful in the Rostóvs’ home.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>Christmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass, the solemn and<br>wearisome Christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants, and the<br>new dresses everyone put on, there were no special festivities, though<br>the calm frost of twenty degrees Réaumur, the dazzling sunshine by day,<br>and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special<br>celebration of the season.<br><br>On the third day of Christmas week, after the midday dinner, all the<br>inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms. It was the dullest time<br>of the day. Nicholas, who had been visiting some neighbors that morning,<br>was asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The old count was resting in his<br>study. Sónya sat in the drawing room at the round table, copying a<br>design for embroidery. The countess was playing patience. Nastásya<br>Ivánovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old<br>ladies. Natásha came into the room, went up to Sónya, glanced at<br>what she was doing, and then went up to her mother and stood without<br>speaking.<br><br>“Why are you wandering about like an outcast?” asked her mother.<br>“What do you want?”<br><br>“Him... I want him... now, this minute! I want him!” said Natásha,<br>with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile.<br><br>The countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter.<br><br>“Don’t look at me, Mamma! Don’t look; I shall cry directly.”<br><br>“Sit down with me a little,” said the countess.<br><br>“Mamma, I want him. Why should I be wasted like this, Mamma?”<br><br>Her voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned quickly to<br>hide them and left the room.<br><br>She passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and then<br>went into the maids’ room. There an old maidservant was grumbling at<br>a young girl who stood panting, having just run in through the cold from<br>the serfs’ quarters.<br><br>“Stop playing—there’s a time for everything,” said the old<br>woman.<br><br>“Let her alone, Kondrátevna,” said Natásha. “Go, Mavrúshka,<br>go.”<br><br>Having released Mavrúshka, Natásha crossed the dancing hall and went<br>to the vestibule. There an old footman and two young ones were playing<br>cards. They broke off and rose as she entered.<br><br>“What can I do with them?” thought Natásha.<br><br>“Oh, Nikíta, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, go to the<br>yard and fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some<br>oats.”<br><br>“Just a few oats?” said Misha, cheerfully and readily.<br><br>“Go, go quickly,” the old man urged him.<br><br>“And you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.”<br><br>On her way past the butler’s pantry she told them to set a samovar,<br>though it was not at all the time for tea.<br><br>Fóka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house.<br>Natásha liked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order and<br>asked whether the samovar was really wanted.<br><br>“Oh dear, what a young lady!” said Fóka, pretending to frown at<br>Natásha.<br><br>No one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as<br>Natásha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to send<br>them on some errand. She seemed to be trying whether any of them would<br>get angry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no one’s orders<br>so readily as they did hers. “What can I do, where can I go?”<br>thought she, as she went slowly along the passage.<br><br>“Nastásya Ivánovna, what sort of children shall I have?” she asked<br>the buffoon, who was coming toward her in a woman’s jacket.<br><br>“Why, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers,” answered the buffoon.<br><br>“O Lord, O Lord, it’s always the same! Oh, where am I to go? What<br>am I to do with myself?” And tapping with her heels, she ran quickly<br>upstairs to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story.<br><br>Two governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which were<br>plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses were discussing<br>whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. Natásha sat down,<br>listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air, and then got<br>up again.<br><br>“The island of Madagascar,” she said, “Ma-da-gas-car,” she<br>repeated, articulating each syllable distinctly, and, not replying to<br>Madame Schoss who asked her what she was saying, she went out of the<br>room.<br><br>Her brother Pétya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance on him<br>he was preparing fireworks to let off that night.<br><br>“Pétya! Pétya!” she called to him. “Carry me downstairs.”<br><br>Pétya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her<br>arms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.<br><br>“No, don’t... the island of Madagascar!” she said, and jumping off<br>his back she went downstairs.<br><br>Having as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made<br>sure that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was dull,<br>Natásha betook herself to the ballroom, picked up her guitar, sat down<br>in a dark corner behind a bookcase, and began to run her fingers over<br>the strings in the bass, picking out a passage she recalled from an<br>opera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew. What she drew from<br>the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners, but in her<br>imagination a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds.<br>She sat behind the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light<br>escaping from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered. She<br>was in a mood for brooding on the past.<br><br>Sónya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. Natásha glanced<br>at her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her that<br>she remembered the light falling through that crack once before and<br>Sónya passing with a glass in her hand. “Yes it was exactly the<br>same,” thought Natásha.<br><br>“Sónya, what is this?” she cried, twanging a thick string.<br><br>“Oh, you are there!” said Sónya with a start, and came near and<br>listened. “I don’t know. A storm?” she ventured timidly, afraid of<br>being wrong.<br><br>“There! That’s just how she started and just how she came up smiling<br>timidly when all this happened before,” thought Natásha, “and in<br>just the same way I thought there was something lacking in her.”<br><br>“No, it’s the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen!” and Natásha<br>sang the air of the chorus so that Sónya should catch it. “Where were<br>you going?” she asked.<br><br>“To change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design.”<br><br>“You always find something to do, but I can’t,” said Natásha.<br>“And where’s Nicholas?”<br><br>“Asleep, I think.”<br><br>“Sónya, go and wake him,” said Natásha. “Tell him I want him to<br>come and sing.”<br><br>She sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened<br>before could be, and without solving this problem, or at all regretting<br>not having done so, she again passed in fancy to the time when she was<br>with him and he was looking at her with a lover’s eyes.<br><br>“Oh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it will never be!<br>And, worst of all, I am growing old—that’s the thing! There won’t<br>then be in me what there is now. But perhaps he’ll come today, will<br>come immediately. Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing<br>room. Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it.” She rose,<br>put down the guitar, and went to the drawing room.<br><br>All the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, were already<br>at the tea table. The servants stood round the table—but Prince Andrew<br>was not there and life was going on as before.<br><br>“Ah, here she is!” said the old count, when he saw Natásha enter.<br>“Well, sit down by me.” But Natásha stayed by her mother and<br>glanced round as if looking for something.<br><br>“Mamma!” she muttered, “give him to me, give him, Mamma, quickly,<br>quickly!” and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs.<br><br>She sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the<br>elders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. “My God, my God!<br>The same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing in the<br>same way!” thought Natásha, feeling with horror a sense of repulsion<br>rising up in her for the whole household, because they were always the<br>same.<br><br>After tea, Nicholas, Sónya, and Natásha went to the sitting room, to<br>their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>“Does it ever happen to you,” said Natásha to her brother, when<br>they settled down in the sitting room, “does it ever happen to you to<br>feel as if there were nothing more to come—nothing; that everything<br>good is past? And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?”<br><br>“I should think so!” he replied. “I have felt like that when<br>everything was all right and everyone was cheerful. The thought has come<br>into my mind that I was already tired of it all, and that we must all<br>die. Once in the regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where there<br>was music... and suddenly I felt so depressed...”<br><br>“Oh yes, I know, I know, I know!” Natásha interrupted him. “When<br>I was quite little that used to be so with me. Do you remember when<br>I was punished once about some plums? You were all dancing, and I sat<br>sobbing in the schoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad and sorry<br>for everyone, for myself, and for everyone. And I was innocent—that<br>was the chief thing,” said Natásha. “Do you remember?”<br><br>“I remember,” answered Nicholas. “I remember that I came to you<br>afterwards and wanted to comfort you, but do you know, I felt ashamed<br>to. We were terribly absurd. I had a funny doll then and wanted to give<br>it to you. Do you remember?”<br><br>“And do you remember,” Natásha asked with a pensive smile, “how<br>once, long, long ago, when we were quite little, Uncle called us into<br>the study—that was in the old house—and it was dark—we went in and<br>suddenly there stood...”<br><br>“A Negro,” chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. “Of course<br>I remember. Even now I don’t know whether there really was a Negro, or<br>if we only dreamed it or were told about him.”<br><br>“He was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and looked<br>at us....”<br><br>“Sónya, do you remember?” asked Nicholas.<br><br>“Yes, yes, I do remember something too,” Sónya answered timidly.<br><br>“You know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro,” said<br>Natásha, “and they say there was no Negro at all. But you see, you<br>remember!”<br><br>“Of course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them.”<br><br>“How strange it is! It’s as if it were a dream! I like that.”<br><br>“And do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom,<br>and suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet? Was that<br>real or not? Do you remember what fun it was?”<br><br>“Yes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in<br>the porch?”<br><br>So they went through their memories, smiling with pleasure: not the sad<br>memories of old age, but poetic, youthful ones—those impressions of<br>one’s most distant past in which dreams and realities blend—and they<br>laughed with quiet enjoyment.<br><br>Sónya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though they shared<br>the same reminiscences.<br><br>Much that they remembered had slipped from her mind, and what she<br>recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced. She<br>simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it.<br><br>She only really took part when they recalled Sónya’s first arrival.<br>She told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because he had on a<br>corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she, too, would be sewn up<br>with cords.<br><br>“And I remember their telling me that you had been born under a<br>cabbage,” said Natásha, “and I remember that I dared not disbelieve<br>it then, but knew that it was not true, and I felt so uncomfortable.”<br><br>While they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of<br>the sitting room.<br><br>“They have brought the cock, Miss,” she said in a whisper.<br><br>“It isn’t wanted, Pólya. Tell them to take it away,” replied<br>Natásha.<br><br>In the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and<br>went up to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took off its cloth<br>covering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.<br><br>“Mr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field,” came the<br>old countess’ voice from the drawing room.<br><br>Dimmler struck a chord and, turning to Natásha, Nicholas, and Sónya,<br>remarked: “How quiet you young people are!”<br><br>“Yes, we’re philosophizing,” said Natásha, glancing round for a<br>moment and then continuing the conversation. They were now discussing<br>dreams.<br><br>Dimmler began to play; Natásha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table,<br>took up a candle, carried it out, and returned, seating herself quietly<br>in her former place. It was dark in the room especially where they were<br>sitting on the sofa, but through the big windows the silvery light of<br>the full moon fell on the floor. Dimmler had finished the piece but<br>still sat softly running his fingers over the strings, evidently<br>uncertain whether to stop or to play something else.<br><br>“Do you know,” said Natásha in a whisper, moving closer to Nicholas<br>and Sónya, “that when one goes on and on recalling memories, one at<br>last begins to remember what happened before one was in the world....”<br><br>“That is metempsychosis,” said Sónya, who had always learned well,<br>and remembered everything. “The Egyptians believed that our souls have<br>lived in animals, and will go back into animals again.”<br><br>“No, I don’t believe we ever were in animals,” said Natásha,<br>still in a whisper though the music had ceased. “But I am certain that<br>we were angels somewhere there, and have been here, and that is why we<br>remember....”<br><br>“May I join you?” said Dimmler who had come up quietly, and he sat<br>down by them.<br><br>“If we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?” said Nicholas.<br>“No, that can’t be!”<br><br>“Not lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know what I<br>was before?” Natásha rejoined with conviction. “The soul is<br>immortal—well then, if I shall always live I must have lived before,<br>lived for a whole eternity.”<br><br>“Yes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity,” remarked Dimmler,<br>who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now<br>spoke as quietly and seriously as they.<br><br>“Why is it hard to imagine eternity?” said Natásha. “It is now<br>today, and it will be tomorrow, and always; and there was yesterday, and<br>the day before....”<br><br>“Natásha! Now it’s your turn. Sing me something,” they heard the<br>countess say. “Why are you sitting there like conspirators?”<br><br>“Mamma, I don’t at all want to,” replied Natásha, but all the<br>same she rose.<br><br>None of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, wanted to break off<br>their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room, but<br>Natásha got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord. Standing<br>as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the<br>resonance was best, Natásha began to sing her mother’s favorite song.<br><br>She had said she did not want to sing, but it was long since she had<br>sung, and long before she again sang, as she did that evening. The<br>count, from his study where he was talking to Mítenka, heard her and,<br>like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play, blundered in his talk<br>while giving orders to the steward, and at last stopped, while Mítenka<br>stood in front of him also listening and smiling. Nicholas did not take<br>his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her. Sónya, as she<br>listened, thought of the immense difference there was between herself<br>and her friend, and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as<br>bewitching as her cousin. The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad<br>smile and with tears in her eyes, occasionally shaking her head. She<br>thought of Natásha and of her own youth, and of how there was something<br>unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of Natásha and Prince<br>Andrew.<br><br>Dimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened with<br>closed eyes.<br><br>“Ah, Countess,” he said at last, “that’s a European talent, she<br>has nothing to learn—what softness, tenderness, and strength....”<br><br>“Ah, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!” said the countess,<br>not realizing to whom she was speaking. Her maternal instinct told her<br>that Natásha had too much of something, and that because of this<br>she would not be happy. Before Natásha had finished singing,<br>fourteen-year-old Pétya rushed in delightedly, to say that some mummers<br>had arrived.<br><br>Natásha stopped abruptly.<br><br>“Idiot!” she screamed at her brother and, running to a chair, threw<br>herself on it, sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long<br>time.<br><br>“It’s nothing, Mamma, really it’s nothing; only Pétya startled<br>me,” she said, trying to smile, but her tears still flowed and sobs<br>still choked her.<br><br>The mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as bears, Turks,<br>innkeepers, and ladies—frightening and funny—bringing in with<br>them the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety, crowded, at first<br>timidly, into the anteroom, then hiding behind one another they pushed<br>into the ballroom where, shyly at first and then more and more merrily<br>and heartily, they started singing, dancing, and playing Christmas<br>games. The countess, when she had identified them and laughed at their<br>costumes, went into the drawing room. The count sat in the ballroom,<br>smiling radiantly and applauding the players. The young people had<br>disappeared.<br><br>Half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the<br>ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt—this was Nicholas. A Turkish<br>girl was Pétya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was Natásha, and a<br>Circassian was Sónya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.<br><br>After the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, from those<br>who were not themselves dressed up, the young people decided that their<br>costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere.<br><br>Nicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid condition, wanted to take<br>them all for a drive in his troyka, proposed to take with them about a<br>dozen of the serf mummers and drive to “Uncle’s.”<br><br>“No, why disturb the old fellow?” said the countess. “Besides,<br>you wouldn’t have room to turn round there. If you must go, go to the<br>Melyukóvs’.”<br><br>Melyukóva was a widow, who, with her family and their tutors and<br>governesses, lived three miles from the Rostóvs.<br><br>“That’s right, my dear,” chimed in the old count, thoroughly<br>aroused. “I’ll dress up at once and go with them. I’ll make<br>Pashette open her eyes.”<br><br>But the countess would not agree to his going; he had had a bad leg all<br>these last days. It was decided that the count must not go, but that if<br>Louisa Ivánovna (Madame Schoss) would go with them, the young ladies<br>might go to the Melyukóvs’, Sónya, generally so timid and shy, more<br>urgently than anyone begging Louisa Ivánovna not to refuse.<br><br>Sónya’s costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows were<br>extraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very handsome,<br>and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her. Some<br>inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided, and<br>in her male attire she seemed quite a different person. Louisa Ivánovna<br>consented to go, and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and<br>small bells, their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow,<br>drove up to the porch.<br><br>Natásha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing<br>from one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax when they all<br>came out into the frost and got into the sleighs, talking, calling to<br>one another, laughing, and shouting.<br><br>Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was the<br>old count’s with a trotter from the Orlóv stud as shaft horse,<br>the fourth was Nicholas’ own with a short shaggy black shaft horse.<br>Nicholas, in his old lady’s dress over which he had belted his hussar<br>overcoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.<br><br>It was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal<br>harness disks and from the eyes of the horses, who looked round in alarm<br>at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof.<br><br>Natásha, Sónya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholas’<br>sleigh; Dimmler, his wife, and Pétya, into the old count’s, and the<br>rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.<br><br>“You go ahead, Zakhár!” shouted Nicholas to his father’s<br>coachman, wishing for a chance to race past him.<br><br>The old count’s troyka, with Dimmler and his party, started forward,<br>squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow, its deep-toned<br>bell clanging. The side horses, pressing against the shafts of the<br>middle horse, sank in the snow, which was dry and glittered like sugar,<br>and threw it up.<br><br>Nicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the others<br>moved noisily, their runners squeaking. At first they drove at a steady<br>trot along the narrow road. While they drove past the garden the shadows<br>of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant<br>moonlight, but as soon as they were past the fence, the snowy plain<br>bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering<br>like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows. Bang, bang! went the<br>first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road, and each of<br>the other sleighs jolted in the same way, and rudely breaking the<br>frost-bound stillness, the troykas began to speed along the road, one<br>after the other.<br><br>“A hare’s track, a lot of tracks!” rang out Natásha’s voice<br>through the frost-bound air.<br><br>“How light it is, Nicholas!” came Sónya’s voice.<br><br>Nicholas glanced round at Sónya, and bent down to see her face closer.<br>Quite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up<br>at him from her sable furs—so close and yet so distant—in the<br>moonlight.<br><br>“That used to be Sónya,” thought he, and looked at her closer and<br>smiled.<br><br>“What is it, Nicholas?”<br><br>“Nothing,” said he and turned again to the horses.<br><br>When they came out onto the beaten highroad—polished by sleigh runners<br>and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were visible in the<br>moonlight—the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and<br>increased their pace. The near side horse, arching his head and breaking<br>into a short canter, tugged at his traces. The shaft horse swayed from<br>side to side, moving his ears as if asking: “Isn’t it time to begin<br>now?” In front, already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing<br>farther and farther off, the black horses driven by Zakhár could be<br>clearly seen against the white snow. From that sleigh one could hear the<br>shouts, laughter, and voices of the mummers.<br><br>“Gee up, my darlings!” shouted Nicholas, pulling the reins to one<br>side and flourishing the whip.<br><br>It was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the<br>side horses who pulled harder—ever increasing their gallop—that<br>one noticed how fast the troyka was flying. Nicholas looked back. With<br>screams, squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses<br>to gallop—the other sleighs followed. The shaft horse swung steadily<br>beneath the bow over its head, with no thought of slackening pace and<br>ready to put on speed when required.<br><br>Nicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill and<br>coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.<br><br>“Where are we?” thought he. “It’s the Kosóy meadow, I suppose.<br>But no—this is something new I’ve never seen before. This isn’t<br>the Kosóy meadow nor the Dëmkin hill, and heaven only knows what it<br>is! It is something new and enchanted. Well, whatever it may be...”<br>And shouting to his horses, he began to pass the first sleigh.<br><br>Zakhár held back his horses and turned his face, which was already<br>covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows.<br><br>Nicholas gave the horses the rein, and Zakhár, stretching out his arms,<br>clucked his tongue and let his horses go.<br><br>“Now, look out, master!” he cried.<br><br>Faster still the two troykas flew side by side, and faster moved<br>the feet of the galloping side horses. Nicholas began to draw ahead.<br>Zakhár, while still keeping his arms extended, raised one hand with the<br>reins.<br><br>“No you won’t, master!” he shouted.<br><br>Nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakhár. The horses<br>showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh—beside<br>them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of<br>swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing.<br>The whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls<br>shrieking were heard from different sides.<br><br>Again checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him. They were still<br>surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with<br>stars.<br><br>“Zakhár is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the<br>left?” thought Nicholas. “Are we getting to the Melyukóvs’? Is<br>this Melyukóvka? Heaven only knows where we are going, and heaven knows<br>what is happening to us—but it is very strange and pleasant whatever<br>it is.” And he looked round in the sleigh.<br><br>“Look, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!” said one of the<br>strange, pretty, unfamiliar people—the one with fine eyebrows and<br>mustache.<br><br>“I think this used to be Natásha,” thought Nicholas, “and that<br>was Madame Schoss, but perhaps it’s not, and this Circassian with the<br>mustache I don’t know, but I love her.”<br><br>“Aren’t you cold?” he asked.<br><br>They did not answer but began to laugh. Dimmler from the sleigh behind<br>shouted something—probably something funny—but they could not make<br>out what he said.<br><br>“Yes, yes!” some voices answered, laughing.<br><br>“But here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows, and a glitter<br>of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy<br>buildings and the shrill yells of some animals. And if this is really<br>Melyukóvka, it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and<br>have come to Melyukóvka,” thought Nicholas.<br><br>It really was Melyukóvka, and maids and footmen with merry faces came<br>running, out to the porch carrying candles.<br><br>“Who is it?” asked someone in the porch.<br><br>“The mummers from the count’s. I know by the horses,” replied some<br>voices.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>Pelagéya Danílovna Melyukóva, a broadly built, energetic woman<br>wearing spectacles, sat in the drawing room in a loose dress, surrounded<br>by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull. They<br>were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows<br>the wax figures would throw on the wall, when they heard the steps and<br>voices of new arrivals in the vestibule.<br><br>Hussars, ladies, witches, clowns, and bears, after clearing their<br>throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule,<br>came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted. The<br>clown—Dimmler—and the lady—Nicholas—started a dance. Surrounded<br>by the screaming children the mummers, covering their faces and<br>disguising their voices, bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves<br>about the room.<br><br>“Dear me! there’s no recognizing them! And Natásha! See whom<br>she looks like! She really reminds me of somebody. But Herr<br>Dimmler—isn’t he good! I didn’t know him! And how he dances. Dear<br>me, there’s a Circassian. Really, how becoming it is to dear Sónya.<br>And who is that? Well, you have cheered us up! Nikíta and Vanya—clear<br>away the tables! And we were sitting so quietly. Ha, ha, ha!... The<br>hussar, the hussar! Just like a boy! And the legs!... I can’t look at<br>him...” different voices were saying.<br><br>Natásha, the young Melyukóvs’ favorite, disappeared with them into<br>the back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments<br>were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from<br>behind the door. Ten minutes later, all the young Melyukóvs joined the<br>mummers.<br><br>Pelagéya Danílovna, having given orders to clear the rooms for the<br>visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs,<br>went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles, peering<br>into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any<br>of them. It was not merely Dimmler and the Rostóvs she failed to<br>recognize, she did not even recognize her own daughters, or her late<br>husband’s, dressing gowns and uniforms, which they had put on.<br><br>“And who is this?” she asked her governess, peering into the face of<br>her own daughter dressed up as a Kazán-Tartar. “I suppose it is one<br>of the Rostóvs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and what regiment do you serve in?”<br>she asked Natásha. “Here, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!”<br>she ordered the butler who was handing things round. “That’s not<br>forbidden by his law.”<br><br>Sometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the<br>dancers, who—having decided once for all that being disguised, no one<br>would recognize them—were not at all shy, Pelagéya Danílovna hid<br>her face in her handkerchief, and her whole stout body shook with<br>irrepressible, kindly, elderly laughter.<br><br>“My little Sásha! Look at Sásha!” she said.<br><br>After Russian country dances and chorus dances, Pelagéya Danílovna<br>made the serfs and gentry join in one large circle: a ring, a string,<br>and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together.<br><br>In an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered. The corked<br>eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring, flushed,<br>and merry faces. Pelagéya Danílovna began to recognize the mummers,<br>admired their cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly how they<br>suited the young ladies, and she thanked them all for having entertained<br>her so well. The visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room,<br>and the serfs had something served to them in the ballroom.<br><br>“Now to tell one’s fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening!”<br>said an old maid who lived with the Melyukóvs, during supper.<br><br>“Why?” said the eldest Melyukóv girl.<br><br>“You wouldn’t go, it takes courage....”<br><br>“I’ll go,” said Sónya.<br><br>“Tell what happened to the young lady!” said the second Melyukóv<br>girl.<br><br>“Well,” began the old maid, “a young lady once went out, took a<br>cock, laid the table for two, all properly, and sat down. After sitting<br>a while, she suddenly hears someone coming... a sleigh drives up with<br>harness bells; she hears him coming! He comes in, just in the shape of a<br>man, like an officer—comes in and sits down to table with her.”<br><br>“Ah! ah!” screamed Natásha, rolling her eyes with horror.<br><br>“Yes? And how... did he speak?”<br><br>“Yes, like a man. Everything quite all right, and he began persuading<br>her; and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow, but she got<br>frightened, just got frightened and hid her face in her hands. Then he<br>caught her up. It was lucky the maids ran in just then....”<br><br>“Now, why frighten them?” said Pelagéya Danílovna.<br><br>“Mamma, you used to try your fate yourself...” said her daughter.<br><br>“And how does one do it in a barn?” inquired Sónya.<br><br>“Well, say you went to the barn now, and listened. It depends on what<br>you hear; hammering and knocking—that’s bad; but a sound of shifting<br>grain is good and one sometimes hears that, too.”<br><br>“Mamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn.”<br><br>Pelagéya Danílovna smiled.<br><br>“Oh, I’ve forgotten...” she replied. “But none of you would<br>go?”<br><br>“Yes, I will; Pelagéya Danílovna, let me! I’ll go,” said Sónya.<br><br>“Well, why not, if you’re not afraid?”<br><br>“Louisa Ivánovna, may I?” asked Sónya.<br><br>Whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or<br>talking as now, Nicholas did not leave Sónya’s side, and gazed at her<br>with quite new eyes. It seemed to him that it was only today, thanks<br>to that burnt-cork mustache, that he had fully learned to know her. And<br>really, that evening, Sónya was brighter, more animated, and prettier<br>than Nicholas had ever seen her before.<br><br>“So that’s what she is like; what a fool I have been!” he thought<br>gazing at her sparkling eyes, and under the mustache a happy rapturous<br>smile dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never seen before.<br><br>“I’m not afraid of anything,” said Sónya. “May I go at once?”<br>She got up.<br><br>They told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen,<br>and they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over her head and<br>shoulders and glanced at Nicholas.<br><br>“What a darling that girl is!” thought he. “And what have I been<br>thinking of till now?”<br><br>Sónya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas went<br>hastily to the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd of people<br>really had made the house stuffy.<br><br>Outside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but even<br>brighter than before. The light was so strong and the snow sparkled with<br>so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real<br>stars were unnoticed. The sky was black and dreary, while the earth was<br>gay.<br><br>“I am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?” thought<br>Nicholas, and running out from the porch he went round the corner of<br>the house and along the path that led to the back porch. He knew Sónya<br>would pass that way. Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood and<br>across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees<br>fell on the snow and on the path. This path led to the barn. The log<br>walls of the barn and its snow-covered roof, that looked as if hewn out<br>of some precious stone, sparkled in the moonlight. A tree in the garden<br>snapped with the frost, and then all was again perfectly silent. His<br>bosom seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and<br>gladness.<br><br>From the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the<br>bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard<br>the voice of an old maidservant saying, “Straight, straight, along the<br>path, Miss. Only, don’t look back.”<br><br>“I am not afraid,” answered Sónya’s voice, and along the path<br>toward Nicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of Sónya’s feet<br>in her thin shoes.<br><br>Sónya came along, wrapped in her cloak. She was only a couple of paces<br>away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas she had<br>known and always slightly feared. He was in a woman’s dress, with<br>tousled hair and a happy smile new to Sónya. She ran rapidly toward<br>him.<br><br>“Quite different and yet the same,” thought Nicholas, looking at her<br>face all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his arms under the cloak<br>that covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and kissed her<br>on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork. Sónya<br>kissed him full on the lips, and disengaging her little hands pressed<br>them to his cheeks.<br><br>“Sónya!... Nicholas!”... was all they said. They ran to the barn<br>and then back again, re-entering, he by the front and she by the back<br>porch.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>When they all drove back from Pelagéya Danílovna’s, Natásha, who<br>always saw and noticed everything, arranged that she and Madame Schoss<br>should go back in the sleigh with Dimmler, and Sónya with Nicholas and<br>the maids.<br><br>On the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and<br>kept peering by that fantastic all-transforming light into Sónya’s<br>face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and<br>his present Sónya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again.<br>He looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new Sónya, and<br>being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss,<br>inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and, looking at the ground<br>flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky, felt himself again in<br>fairyland.<br><br>“Sónya, is it well with thee?” he asked from time to time.<br><br>“Yes!” she replied. “And with thee?”<br><br>When halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for<br>a moment to Natásha’s sleigh and stood on its wing.<br><br>“Natásha!” he whispered in French, “do you know I have made up my<br>mind about Sónya?”<br><br>“Have you told her?” asked Natásha, suddenly beaming all over with<br>joy.<br><br>“Oh, how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows!...<br>Natásha—are you glad?”<br><br>“I am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with you. I did<br>not tell you, but you have been treating her badly. What a heart she<br>has, Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be happy<br>while Sónya was not,” continued Natásha. “Now I am so glad! Well,<br>run back to her.”<br><br>“No, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!” cried Nicholas, peering<br>into her face and finding in his sister too something new, unusual, and<br>bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before. “Natásha,<br>it’s magical, isn’t it?”<br><br>“Yes,” she replied. “You have done splendidly.”<br><br>“Had I seen her before as she is now,” thought Nicholas, “I should<br>long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me,<br>and all would have been well.”<br><br>“So you are glad and I have done right?”<br><br>“Oh, quite right! I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it.<br>Mamma said she was angling for you. How could she say such a thing! I<br>nearly stormed at Mamma. I will never let anyone say anything bad of<br>Sónya, for there is nothing but good in her.”<br><br>“Then it’s all right?” said Nicholas, again scrutinizing the<br>expression of his sister’s face to see if she was in earnest. Then he<br>jumped down and, his boots scrunching the snow, ran back to his sleigh.<br>The same happy, smiling Circassian, with mustache and beaming eyes<br>looking up from under a sable hood, was still sitting there, and that<br>Circassian was Sónya, and that Sónya was certainly his future happy<br>and loving wife.<br><br>When they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the<br>evening at the Melyukóvs’, the girls went to their bedroom. When they<br>had undressed, but without washing off the cork mustaches, they sat a<br>long time talking of their happiness. They talked of how they would live<br>when they were married, how their husbands would be friends, and how<br>happy they would be. On Natásha’s table stood two looking glasses<br>which Dunyásha had prepared beforehand.<br><br>“Only when will all that be? I am afraid never.... It would be too<br>good!” said Natásha, rising and going to the looking glasses.<br><br>“Sit down, Natásha; perhaps you’ll see him,” said Sónya.<br><br>Natásha lit the candles, one on each side of one of the looking<br>glasses, and sat down.<br><br>“I see someone with a mustache,” said Natásha, seeing her own face.<br><br>“You mustn’t laugh, Miss,” said Dunyásha.<br><br>With Sónya’s help and the maid’s, Natásha got the glass she held<br>into the right position opposite the other; her face assumed a serious<br>expression and she sat silent. She sat a long time looking at the<br>receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting (from<br>tales she had heard) to see a coffin, or him, Prince Andrew, in that<br>last dim, indistinctly outlined square. But ready as she was to take the<br>smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin, she saw nothing.<br>She began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses.<br><br>“Why is it others see things and I don’t?” she said. “You sit<br>down now, Sónya. You absolutely must, tonight! Do it for me.... Today I<br>feel so frightened!”<br><br>Sónya sat down before the glasses, got the right position, and began<br>looking.<br><br>“Now, Miss Sónya is sure to see something,” whispered Dunyásha;<br>“while you do nothing but laugh.”<br><br>Sónya heard this and Natásha’s whisper:<br><br>“I know she will. She saw something last year.”<br><br>For about three minutes all were silent.<br><br>“Of course she will!” whispered Natásha, but did not finish...<br>suddenly Sónya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her<br>eyes with her hand.<br><br>“Oh, Natásha!” she cried.<br><br>“Did you see? Did you? What was it?” exclaimed Natásha, holding up<br>the looking glass.<br><br>Sónya had not seen anything, she was just wanting to blink and to get<br>up when she heard Natásha say, “Of course she will!” She did not<br>wish to disappoint either Dunyásha or Natásha, but it was hard to sit<br>still. She did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her<br>when she covered her eyes.<br><br>“You saw him?” urged Natásha, seizing her hand.<br><br>“Yes. Wait a bit... I... saw him,” Sónya could not help saying, not<br>yet knowing whom Natásha meant by him, Nicholas or Prince Andrew.<br><br>“But why shouldn’t I say I saw something? Others do see! Besides who<br>can tell whether I saw anything or not?” flashed through Sónya’s<br>mind.<br><br>“Yes, I saw him,” she said.<br><br>“How? Standing or lying?”<br><br>“No, I saw... At first there was nothing, then I saw him lying<br>down.”<br><br>“Andrew lying? Is he ill?” asked Natásha, her frightened eyes fixed<br>on her friend.<br><br>“No, on the contrary, on the contrary! His face was cheerful, and he<br>turned to me.” And when saying this she herself fancied she had really<br>seen what she described.<br><br>“Well, and then, Sónya?...”<br><br>“After that, I could not make out what there was; something blue and<br>red....”<br><br>“Sónya! When will he come back? When shall I see him! O, God, how<br>afraid I am for him and for myself and about everything!...” Natásha<br>began, and without replying to Sónya’s words of comfort she got into<br>bed, and long after her candle was out lay open-eyed and motionless,<br>gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>Soon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother of his love<br>for Sónya and of his firm resolve to marry her. The countess, who<br>had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this<br>declaration, listened to him in silence and then told her son that he<br>might marry whom he pleased, but that neither she nor his father would<br>give their blessing to such a marriage. Nicholas, for the first time,<br>felt that his mother was displeased with him and that, despite her love<br>for him, she would not give way. Coldly, without looking at her son,<br>she sent for her husband and, when he came, tried briefly and coldly to<br>inform him of the facts, in her son’s presence, but unable to restrain<br>herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room. The old<br>count began irresolutely to admonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his<br>purpose. Nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word, and his<br>father, sighing and evidently disconcerted, very soon became silent and<br>went in to the countess. In all his encounters with his son, the count<br>was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the<br>family fortune, and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to<br>marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless Sónya. On this occasion, he<br>was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not<br>been in disorder, no better wife for Nicholas than Sónya could have<br>been wished for, and that no one but himself with his Mítenka and<br>his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family<br>finances.<br><br>The father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again,<br>but a few days later the countess sent for Sónya and, with a cruelty<br>neither of them expected, reproached her niece for trying to catch<br>Nicholas and for ingratitude. Sónya listened silently with downcast<br>eyes to the countess’ cruel words, without understanding what<br>was required of her. She was ready to sacrifice everything for her<br>benefactors. Self-sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case<br>she could not see what she ought to sacrifice, or for whom. She could<br>not help loving the countess and the whole Rostóv family, but neither<br>could she help loving Nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended<br>on that love. She was silent and sad and did not reply. Nicholas felt<br>the situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his<br>mother. He first implored her to forgive him and Sónya and consent to<br>their marriage, then he threatened that if she molested Sónya he would<br>at once marry her secretly.<br><br>The countess, with a coldness her son had never seen in her before,<br>replied that he was of age, that Prince Andrew was marrying without his<br>father’s consent, and he could do the same, but that she would never<br>receive that intriguer as her daughter.<br><br>Exploding at the word intriguer, Nicholas, raising his voice, told<br>his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his<br>feelings, but if that were so, he would say for the last time.... But he<br>had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face<br>caused his mother to await with terror, and which would perhaps have<br>forever remained a cruel memory to them both. He had not time to say it,<br>for Natásha, with a pale and set face, entered the room from the door<br>at which she had been listening.<br><br>“Nicholas, you are talking nonsense! Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, I<br>tell you!...” she almost screamed, so as to drown his voice.<br><br>“Mamma darling, it’s not at all so... my poor, sweet darling,” she<br>said to her mother, who conscious that they had been on the brink of<br>a rupture gazed at her son with terror, but in the obstinacy and<br>excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way.<br><br>“Nicholas, I’ll explain to you. Go away! Listen, Mamma darling,”<br>said Natásha.<br><br>Her words were incoherent, but they attained the purpose at which she<br>was aiming.<br><br>The countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughter’s breast,<br>while Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the room.<br><br>Natásha set to work to effect a reconciliation, and so far succeeded<br>that Nicholas received a promise from his mother that Sónya should not<br>be troubled, while he on his side promised not to undertake anything<br>without his parents’ knowledge.<br><br>Firmly resolved, after putting his affairs in order in the regiment,<br>to retire from the army and return and marry Sónya, Nicholas, serious,<br>sorrowful, and at variance with his parents, but, as it seemed to him,<br>passionately in love, left at the beginning of January to rejoin his<br>regiment.<br><br>After Nicholas had gone things in the Rostóv household were more<br>depressing than ever, and the countess fell ill from mental agitation.<br><br>Sónya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more so on<br>account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward<br>her. The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his<br>affairs, which called for some decisive action. Their town house and<br>estate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold, and for this they had to<br>go to Moscow. But the countess’ health obliged them to delay their<br>departure from day to day.<br><br>Natásha, who had borne the first period of separation from her<br>betrothed lightly and even cheerfully, now grew more agitated and<br>impatient every day. The thought that her best days, which she would<br>have employed in loving him, were being vainly wasted, with no advantage<br>to anyone, tormented her incessantly. His letters for the most part<br>irritated her. It hurt her to think that while she lived only in the<br>thought of him, he was living a real life, seeing new places and new<br>people that interested him. The more interesting his letters were<br>the more vexed she felt. Her letters to him, far from giving her any<br>comfort, seemed to her a wearisome and artificial obligation. She could<br>not write, because she could not conceive the possibility of expressing<br>sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by<br>voice, smile, and glance. She wrote to him formal, monotonous, and dry<br>letters, to which she attached no importance herself, and in the rough<br>copies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling.<br><br>There was still no improvement in the countess’ health, but it was<br>impossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer. Natásha’s<br>trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold. Moreover, Prince Andrew<br>was expected in Moscow, where old Prince Bolkónski was spending the<br>winter, and Natásha felt sure he had already arrived.<br><br>So the countess remained in the country, and the count, taking Sónya<br>and Natásha with him, went to Moscow at the end of January.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK EIGHT: 1811 - 12<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>After Prince Andrew’s engagement to Natásha, Pierre without any<br>apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before.<br>Firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his<br>benefactor, and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man, to<br>which he had devoted himself with such ardor—all the zest of such a<br>life vanished after the engagement of Andrew and Natásha and the death<br>of Joseph Alexéevich, the news of which reached him almost at the same<br>time. Only the skeleton of life remained: his house, a brilliant wife<br>who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage, acquaintance<br>with all Petersburg, and his court service with its dull formalities.<br>And this life suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly loathsome. He<br>ceased keeping a diary, avoided the company of the Brothers, began going<br>to the club again, drank a great deal, and came once more in touch<br>with the bachelor sets, leading such a life that the Countess Hélène<br>thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it. Pierre felt that<br>she was right, and to avoid compromising her went away to Moscow.<br><br>In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and<br>fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as soon as,<br>driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable<br>tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons, the Krémlin<br>Square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sleigh drivers and<br>hovels of the Sívtsev Vrazhók, those old Moscovites who desired<br>nothing, hurried nowhere, and were ending their days leisurely; when he<br>saw those old Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls, and the English Club, he<br>felt himself at home in a quiet haven. In Moscow he felt at peace, at<br>home, warm and dirty as in an old dressing gown.<br><br>Moscow society, from the old women down to the children, received Pierre<br>like a long-expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him.<br>For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest, most intellectual,<br>merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a heedless, genial nobleman of<br>the old Russian type. His purse was always empty because it was open to<br>everyone.<br><br>Benefit performances, poor pictures, statues, benevolent societies,<br>gypsy choirs, schools, subscription dinners, sprees, Freemasons,<br>churches, and books—no one and nothing met with a refusal from him,<br>and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from<br>him and taken him under their protection, he would have given everything<br>away. There was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him. As<br>soon as he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of Margaux<br>he was surrounded, and talking, disputing, and joking began. When there<br>were quarrels, his kindly smile and well-timed jests reconciled the<br>antagonists. The Masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not<br>there.<br><br>When after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile,<br>yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere<br>with them, shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men.<br>At balls he danced if a partner was needed. Young ladies, married and<br>unmarried, liked him because without making love to any of them, he was<br>equally amiable to all, especially after supper. “Il est charmant; il<br>n’a pas de sexe,” * they said of him.<br><br>    * “He is charming; he has no sex.”<br><br><br>Pierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there were<br>hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow.<br><br>How horrified he would have been seven years before, when he first<br>arrived from abroad, had he been told that there was no need for him<br>to seek or plan anything, that his rut had long been shaped, eternally<br>predetermined, and that wriggle as he might, he would be what all in<br>his position were. He could not have believed it! Had he not at one<br>time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in Russia;<br>then himself to be a Napoleon; then to be a philosopher; and then<br>a strategist and the conqueror of Napoleon? Had he not seen the<br>possibility of, and passionately desired, the regeneration of the sinful<br>human race, and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection?<br>Had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs?<br><br>But instead of all that—here he was, the wealthy husband of an<br>unfaithful wife, a retired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of eating and<br>drinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, of abusing the government<br>a bit, a member of the Moscow English Club, and a universal favorite in<br>Moscow society. For a long time he could not reconcile himself to the<br>idea that he was one of those same retired Moscow gentlemen-in-waiting<br>he had so despised seven years before.<br><br>Sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living<br>this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought of how<br>many, like himself, had entered that life and that club temporarily,<br>with all their teeth and hair, and had only left it when not a single<br>tooth or hair remained.<br><br>In moments of pride, when he thought of his position it seemed to<br>him that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired<br>gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were empty, stupid,<br>contented fellows, satisfied with their position, “while I am still<br>discontented and want to do something for mankind. But perhaps all these<br>comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new, a<br>path in life of their own, and like me were brought by force of<br>circumstances, society, and race—by that elemental force against which<br>man is powerless—to the condition I am in,” said he to himself in<br>moments of humility; and after living some time in Moscow he no longer<br>despised, but began to grow fond of, to respect, and to pity his<br>comrades in destiny, as he pitied himself.<br><br>Pierre no longer suffered moments of despair, hypochondria, and disgust<br>with life, but the malady that had formerly found expression in such<br>acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment.<br>“What for? Why? What is going on in the world?” he would ask himself<br>in perplexity several times a day, involuntarily beginning to reflect<br>anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life; but knowing by experience<br>that there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away<br>from them, and took up a book, or hurried off to the club or to Apollón<br>Nikoláevich’s, to exchange the gossip of the town.<br><br>“Hélène, who has never cared for anything but her own body and<br>is one of the stupidest women in the world,” thought Pierre, “is<br>regarded by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement, and they<br>pay homage to her. Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he<br>was great, but now that he has become a wretched comedian the Emperor<br>Francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage. The<br>Spaniards, through the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their<br>victory over the French on the fourteenth of June, and the French,<br>also through the Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same<br>fourteenth of June they defeated the Spaniards. My brother Masons swear<br>by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their<br>neighbor, but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the<br>poor, and they intrigue, the Astraea Lodge against the Manna Seekers,<br>and fuss about an authentic Scotch carpet and a charter that nobody<br>needs, and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does not<br>understand. We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries<br>and love of our neighbors, the law in honor of which we have built in<br>Moscow forty times forty churches—but yesterday a deserter was knouted<br>to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness, a<br>priest, gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution.” So<br>thought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception which everyone<br>accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each time as if it<br>were something new. “I understand the deception and confusion,” he<br>thought, “but how am I to tell them all that I see? I have tried, and<br>have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand<br>it as I do, and only try not to see it. So it appears that it must<br>be so! But I—what is to become of me?” thought he. He had the<br>unfortunate capacity many men, especially Russians, have of seeing and<br>believing in the possibility of goodness and truth, but of seeing the<br>evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part<br>in it. Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes, with evil and<br>deception. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged in, the evil and<br>falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity. Yet he<br>had to live and to find occupation. It was too dreadful to be under<br>the burden of these insoluble problems, so he abandoned himself to<br>any distraction in order to forget them. He frequented every kind of<br>society, drank much, bought pictures, engaged in building, and above<br>all—read.<br><br>He read, and read everything that came to hand. On coming home, while<br>his valets were still taking off his things, he picked up a book and<br>began to read. From reading he passed to sleeping, from sleeping to<br>gossip in drawing rooms of the club, from gossip to carousals and women;<br>from carousals back to gossip, reading, and wine. Drinking became more<br>and more a physical and also a moral necessity. Though the doctors<br>warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him, he<br>drank a great deal. He was only quite at ease when having poured several<br>glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant<br>warmth in his body, an amiability toward all his fellows, and a<br>readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it<br>deeply. Only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the<br>terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was<br>not as dreadful as he had thought. He was always conscious of some<br>aspect of that skein, as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or<br>supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read. But under the<br>influence of wine he said to himself: “It doesn’t matter. I’ll<br>get it unraveled. I have a solution ready, but have no time now—I’ll<br>think it all out later on!” But the later on never came.<br><br>In the morning, on an empty stomach, all the old questions appeared as<br>insoluble and terrible as ever, and Pierre hastily picked up a book, and<br>if anyone came to see him he was glad.<br><br>Sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when<br>entrenched under the enemy’s fire, if they have nothing to do, try<br>hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger. To<br>Pierre all men seemed like those soldiers, seeking refuge from life:<br>some in ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in women,<br>some in toys, some in horses, some in politics, some in sport, some<br>in wine, and some in governmental affairs. “Nothing is trivial, and<br>nothing is important, it’s all the same—only to save oneself from it<br>as best one can,” thought Pierre. “Only not to see it, that dreadful<br>it!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>At the beginning of winter Prince Nicholas Bolkónski and his daughter<br>moved to Moscow. At that time enthusiasm for the Emperor Alexander’s<br>regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti-French tendency prevailed<br>there, and this, together with his past and his intellect and his<br>originality, at once made Prince Nicholas Bolkónski an object of<br>particular respect to the Moscovites and the center of the Moscow<br>opposition to the government.<br><br>The prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked signs of<br>senility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite recent<br>events, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with which<br>he accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition. In spite of this<br>the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful<br>veneration—especially of an evening when he came in to tea in his<br>old-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, aroused by anyone, told his<br>abrupt stories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing<br>criticisms of the present. For them all, that old-fashioned house with<br>its gigantic mirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered footmen, and<br>the stern shrewd old man (himself a relic of the past century) with his<br>gentle daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted<br>to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle. But the visitors<br>did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw<br>their host, there were also twenty-two hours in the day during which the<br>private and intimate life of the house continued.<br><br>Latterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary.<br>There in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures—talks with<br>the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hills—and<br>she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life. She did not<br>go out into society; everyone knew that her father would not let her<br>go anywhere without him, and his failing health prevented his going out<br>himself, so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties. She<br>had quite abandoned the hope of getting married. She saw the coldness<br>and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the<br>young men, possible suitors, who sometimes appeared at their house. She<br>had no friends: during this visit to Moscow she had been disappointed in<br>the two who had been nearest to her. Mademoiselle Bourienne, with whom<br>she had never been able to be quite frank, had now become unpleasant to<br>her, and for various reasons Princess Mary avoided her. Julie, with whom<br>she had corresponded for the last five years, was in Moscow, but proved<br>to be quite alien to her when they met. Just then Julie, who by the<br>death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in Moscow,<br>was in the full whirl of society pleasures. She was surrounded by young<br>men who, she fancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth.<br>Julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels<br>that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be<br>decided now or never. On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a<br>mournful smile that she now had no one to write to, since Julie—whose<br>presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week. Like the<br>old émigré who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his<br>evenings for years, she regretted Julie’s presence and having no one<br>to write to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk to, no one to<br>whom to confide her sorrow, and much sorrow fell to her lot just then.<br>The time for Prince Andrew’s return and marriage was approaching, but<br>his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried<br>out; in fact, it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless, for at every<br>mention of the young Countess Rostóva the old prince (who apart from<br>that was usually in a bad temper) lost control of himself. Another<br>lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year-old<br>nephew. To her consternation she detected in herself in relation to<br>little Nicholas some symptoms of her father’s irritability. However<br>often she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her<br>nephew, almost every time that, pointer in hand, she sat down to show<br>him the French alphabet, she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly<br>and easily into the child—who was already afraid that Auntie might at<br>any moment get angry—that at his slightest inattention she trembled,<br>became flustered and heated, raised her voice, and sometimes pulled him<br>by the arm and put him in the corner. Having put him in the corner<br>she would herself begin to cry over her cruel, evil nature, and little<br>Nicholas, following her example, would sob, and without permission would<br>leave his corner, come to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and<br>comfort her. But what distressed the princess most of all was her<br>father’s irritability, which was always directed against her and had<br>of late amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to<br>the ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water,<br>it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but<br>this loving despot—the more cruel because he loved her and for that<br>reason tormented himself and her—knew how not merely to hurt and<br>humiliate her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame<br>for everything. Of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented<br>Princess Mary more than anything else; this was his ever-increasing<br>intimacy with Mademoiselle Bourienne. The idea that at the first moment<br>of receiving the news of his son’s intentions had occurred to him in<br>jest—that if Andrew got married he himself would marry Bourienne—had<br>evidently pleased him, and latterly he had persistently, and as it<br>seemed to Princess Mary merely to offend her, shown special endearments<br>to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by<br>demonstrations of love of Bourienne.<br><br>One day in Moscow in Princess Mary’s presence (she thought her father<br>did it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne’s hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her affectionately.<br>Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room. A few minutes later<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Mary’s room smiling and<br>making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess Mary hastily<br>wiped away her tears, went resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne,<br>and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry<br>haste at the Frenchwoman, her voice breaking: “It’s horrible, vile,<br>inhuman, to take advantage of the weakness...” She did not finish.<br>“Leave my room,” she exclaimed, and burst into sobs.<br><br>Next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she noticed<br>that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne should be<br>served first. After dinner, when the footman handed coffee and from<br>habit began with the princess, the prince suddenly grew furious,<br>threw his stick at Philip, and instantly gave instructions to have him<br>conscripted for the army.<br><br>“He doesn’t obey... I said it twice... and he doesn’t obey! She<br>is the first person in this house; she’s my best friend,” cried<br>the prince. “And if you allow yourself,” he screamed in a fury,<br>addressing Princess Mary for the first time, “to forget yourself again<br>before her as you dared to do yesterday, I will show you who is master<br>in this house. Go! Don’t let me set eyes on you; beg her pardon!”<br><br>Princess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienne’s pardon, and also her<br>father’s pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who had begged<br>for her intervention.<br><br>At such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her<br>soul. And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his<br>spectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not seeing them, or<br>would forget something that had just occurred, or take a false step with<br>his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness,<br>or, worst of all, at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him<br>would suddenly fall asleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking<br>head sink over his plate. “He is old and feeble, and I dare to condemn<br>him!” she thought at such moments, with a feeling of revulsion against<br>herself.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>In 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctor—Métivier—who had<br>rapidly become the fashion. He was enormously tall, handsome, amiable<br>as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an extraordinarily clever<br>doctor. He was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor, but<br>as an equal.<br><br>Prince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne’s advice had allowed this doctor to visit him<br>and had grown accustomed to him. Métivier came to see the prince about<br>twice a week.<br><br>On December 6—St. Nicholas’ Day and the prince’s name day—all<br>Moscow came to the prince’s front door but he gave orders to admit no<br>one and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom he gave<br>to Princess Mary.<br><br>Métivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, considered<br>it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne, * as he told<br>Princess Mary, and went in to see the prince. It happened that on that<br>morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods. He had<br>been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone<br>and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be<br>understood himself. Princess Mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed<br>querulousness, which generally culminated in a burst of rage, and she<br>went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun<br>and awaited the inevitable explosion. Until the doctor’s arrival the<br>morning had passed off safely. After admitting the doctor, Princess Mary<br>sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she<br>could hear all that passed in the study.<br><br>    * To force the guard.<br><br>At first she heard only Métivier’s voice, then her father’s, then<br>both voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung open,<br>and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified<br>Métivier with his shock of black hair, and the prince in his dressing<br>gown and fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes<br>rolled downwards.<br><br>“You don’t understand?” shouted the prince, “but I do! French<br>spy, slave of Buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! Be off, I tell<br>you...” and he slammed the door.<br><br>Métivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne<br>who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.<br><br>“The prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head. Keep<br>calm, I will call again tomorrow,” said Métivier; and putting his<br>fingers to his lips he hastened away.<br><br>Through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry:<br>“Spies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a moment’s peace in my<br>own house!”<br><br>After Métivier’s departure the old prince called his daughter in, and<br>the whole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that a spy<br>had been admitted. Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list,<br>and not to admit anyone who was not on that list? Then why was that<br>scoundrel admitted? She was the cause of it all. With her, he said, he<br>could not have a moment’s peace and could not die quietly.<br><br>“No, ma’am! We must part, we must part! Understand that, understand<br>it! I cannot endure any more,” he said, and left the room. Then, as if<br>afraid she might find some means of consolation, he returned and trying<br>to appear calm added: “And don’t imagine I have said this in a<br>moment of anger. I am calm. I have thought it over, and it will be<br>carried out—we must part; so find some place for yourself....” But<br>he could not restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one<br>who loves is capable, evidently suffering himself, he shook his fists at<br>her and screamed:<br><br>“If only some fool would marry her!” Then he slammed the door, sent<br>for Mademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his study.<br><br>At two o’clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.<br><br>These guests—the famous Count Rostopchín, Prince Lopukhín with his<br>nephew, General Chatróv an old war comrade of the prince’s, and<br>of the younger generation Pierre and Borís Drubetskóy—awaited the<br>prince in the drawing room.<br><br>Borís, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, had been<br>anxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolkónski, and had contrived<br>to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an<br>exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house.<br><br>The prince’s house did not belong to what is known as fashionable<br>society, but his little circle—though not much talked about in<br>town—was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other.<br>Borís had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in<br>his presence invited Rostopchín to dinner on St. Nicholas’ Day, and<br>Rostopchín had replied that he could not come:<br><br>“On that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince<br>Nicholas Bolkónski.”<br><br>“Oh, yes, yes!” replied the commander in chief. “How is he?...”<br><br>The small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old-fashioned<br>drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of<br>a court of justice. All were silent or talked in low tones. Prince<br>Nicholas came in serious and taciturn. Princess Mary seemed even quieter<br>and more diffident than usual. The guests were reluctant to address<br>her, feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation. Count<br>Rostopchín alone kept the conversation going, now relating the latest<br>town news, and now the latest political gossip.<br><br>Lopukhín and the old general occasionally took part in the<br>conversation. Prince Bolkónski listened as a presiding judge receives a<br>report, only now and then, silently or by a brief word, showing that<br>he took heed of what was being reported to him. The tone of the<br>conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was<br>being done in the political world. Incidents were related evidently<br>confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse, but<br>whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped,<br>or was stopped, at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the<br>sovereign himself.<br><br>At dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleon’s<br>seizure of the Duke of Oldenburg’s territory, and the Russian Note,<br>hostile to Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts.<br><br>“Bonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel,” said<br>Count Rostopchín, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times<br>before. “One only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the<br>crowned heads. Now the Pope’s turn has come and Bonaparte doesn’t<br>scruple to depose the head of the Catholic Church—yet all keep silent!<br>Our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the Duke<br>of Oldenburg’s territory, and even...” Count Rostopchín paused,<br>feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was<br>impossible.<br><br>“Other territories have been offered in exchange for the Duchy of<br>Oldenburg,” said Prince Bolkónski. “He shifts the Dukes about as<br>I might move my serfs from Bald Hills to Boguchárovo or my Ryazán<br>estates.”<br><br>“The Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable<br>strength of character and resignation,” remarked Borís, joining in<br>respectfully.<br><br>He said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the honor<br>of being presented to the Duke. Prince Bolkónski glanced at the<br>young man as if about to say something in reply, but changed his mind,<br>evidently considering him too young.<br><br>“I have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was surprised<br>how badly the Note was worded,” remarked Count Rostopchín in the<br>casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him.<br><br>Pierre looked at Rostopchín with naïve astonishment, not understanding<br>why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the Note.<br><br>“Does it matter, Count, how the Note is worded,” he asked, “so<br>long as its substance is forcible?”<br><br>“My dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops it should be<br>easy to have a good style,” returned Count Rostopchín.<br><br>Pierre now understood the count’s dissatisfaction with the wording of<br>the Note.<br><br>“One would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up,”<br>remarked the old prince. “There in Petersburg they are always<br>writing—not notes only but even new laws. My Andrew there has written<br>a whole volume of laws for Russia. Nowadays they are always writing!”<br>and he laughed unnaturally.<br><br>There was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general cleared<br>his throat to draw attention.<br><br>“Did you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? The<br>figure cut by the new French ambassador.”<br><br>“Eh? Yes, I heard something: he said something awkward in His<br>Majesty’s presence.”<br><br>“His Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the march<br>past,” continued the general, “and it seems the ambassador took<br>no notice and allowed himself to reply that: ‘We in France pay no<br>attention to such trifles!’ The Emperor did not condescend to reply.<br>At the next review, they say, the Emperor did not once deign to address<br>him.”<br><br>All were silent. On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, it was<br>impossible to pass any judgment.<br><br>“Impudent fellows!” said the prince. “You know Métivier? I turned<br>him out of my house this morning. He was here; they admitted him in<br>spite of my request that they should let no one in,” he went on,<br>glancing angrily at his daughter.<br><br>And he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and<br>the reasons that convinced him that Métivier was a spy. Though these<br>reasons were very insufficient and obscure, no one made any rejoinder.<br><br>After the roast, champagne was served. The guests rose to congratulate<br>the old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to him.<br><br>He gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled,<br>clean-shaven cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told<br>her that he had not forgotten the morning’s talk, that his decision<br>remained in force, and only the presence of visitors hindered his<br>speaking of it to her now.<br><br>When they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, the old<br>men sat together.<br><br>Prince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the<br>impending war.<br><br>He said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we<br>sought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into European<br>affairs, into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit. “We<br>ought not to fight either for or against Austria. Our political<br>interests are all in the East, and in regard to Bonaparte the only thing<br>is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy, and he will never dare<br>to cross the Russian frontier, as was the case in 1807!”<br><br>“How can we fight the French, Prince?” said Count Rostopchín.<br>“Can we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities? Look at<br>our youths, look at our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our<br>Kingdom of Heaven.”<br><br>He began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.<br><br>“French dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you turned<br>Métivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a Frenchman and<br>a scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their knees. I went to<br>a party last night, and there out of five ladies three were Roman<br>Catholics and had the Pope’s indulgence for doing woolwork on Sundays.<br>And they themselves sit there nearly naked, like the signboards at our<br>Public Baths if I may say so. Ah, when one looks at our young people,<br>Prince, one would like to take Peter the Great’s old cudgel out of the<br>museum and belabor them in the Russian way till all the nonsense jumps<br>out of them.”<br><br>All were silent. The old prince looked at Rostopchín with a smile and<br>wagged his head approvingly.<br><br>“Well, good-by, your excellency, keep well!” said Rostopchín,<br>getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the<br>prince.<br><br>“Good-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never tire of<br>hearing him!” said the old prince, keeping hold of the hand and<br>offering his cheek to be kissed.<br><br>Following Rostopchín’s example the others also rose.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>Princess Mary as she sat listening to the old men’s talk and<br>faultfinding, understood nothing of what she heard; she only wondered<br>whether the guests had all observed her father’s hostile attitude<br>toward her. She did not even notice the special attentions and<br>amiabilities shown her during dinner by Borís Drubetskóy, who was<br>visiting them for the third time already.<br><br>Princess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to Pierre, who<br>hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to<br>approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone<br>in the drawing room.<br><br>“May I stay a little longer?” he said, letting his stout body sink<br>into an armchair beside her.<br><br>“Oh yes,” she answered. “You noticed nothing?” her look asked.<br><br>Pierre was in an agreeable after-dinner mood. He looked straight before<br>him and smiled quietly.<br><br>“Have you known that young man long, Princess?” he asked.<br><br>“Who?”<br><br>“Drubetskóy.”<br><br>“No, not long....”<br><br>“Do you like him?”<br><br>“Yes, he is an agreeable young man.... Why do you ask me that?” said<br>Princess Mary, still thinking of that morning’s conversation with her<br>father.<br><br>“Because I have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from<br>Petersburg to Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an<br>heiress.”<br><br>“You have observed that?” said Princess Mary.<br><br>“Yes,” returned Pierre with a smile, “and this young man now<br>manages matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is<br>too. I can read him like a book. At present he is hesitating whom to lay<br>siege to—you or Mademoiselle Julie Karágina. He is very attentive to<br>her.”<br><br>“He visits them?”<br><br>“Yes, very often. And do you know the new way of courting?” said<br>Pierre with an amused smile, evidently in that cheerful mood of good<br>humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary.<br><br>“No,” replied Princess Mary.<br><br>“To please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy. He is very<br>melancholy with Mademoiselle Karágina,” said Pierre.<br><br>“Really?” asked Princess Mary, looking into Pierre’s kindly<br>face and still thinking of her own sorrow. “It would be a relief,”<br>thought she, “if I ventured to confide what I am feeling to someone.<br>I should like to tell everything to Pierre. He is kind and generous. It<br>would be a relief. He would give me advice.”<br><br>“Would you marry him?”<br><br>“Oh, my God, Count, there are moments when I would marry anybody!”<br>she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice.<br>“Ah, how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel<br>that...” she went on in a trembling voice, “that you can do nothing<br>for him but grieve him, and to know that you cannot alter this. Then<br>there is only one thing left—to go away, but where could I go?”<br><br>“What is wrong? What is it, Princess?”<br><br>But without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst into<br>tears.<br><br>“I don’t know what is the matter with me today. Don’t take any<br>notice—forget what I have said!”<br><br>Pierre’s gaiety vanished completely. He anxiously questioned the<br>princess, asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him; but<br>she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said, that<br>she did not remember what she had said, and that she had no trouble<br>except the one he knew of—that Prince Andrew’s marriage threatened<br>to cause a rupture between father and son.<br><br>“Have you any news of the Rostóvs?” she asked, to change the<br>subject. “I was told they are coming soon. I am also expecting Andrew<br>any day. I should like them to meet here.”<br><br>“And how does he now regard the matter?” asked Pierre, referring to<br>the old prince.<br><br>Princess Mary shook her head.<br><br>“What is to be done? In a few months the year will be up. The thing<br>is impossible. I only wish I could spare my brother the first moments.<br>I wish they would come sooner. I hope to be friends with her. You have<br>known them a long time,” said Princess Mary. “Tell me honestly<br>the whole truth: what sort of girl is she, and what do you think of<br>her?—The real truth, because you know Andrew is risking so much doing<br>this against his father’s will that I should like to know....”<br><br>An undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations, and<br>repeated requests to be told the whole truth, expressed ill-will on<br>the princess’ part toward her future sister-in-law and a wish that<br>he should disapprove of Andrew’s choice; but in reply he said what he<br>felt rather than what he thought.<br><br>“I don’t know how to answer your question,” he said, blushing<br>without knowing why. “I really don’t know what sort of girl she is;<br>I can’t analyze her at all. She is enchanting, but what makes her so I<br>don’t know. That is all one can say about her.”<br><br>Princess Mary sighed, and the expression on her face said: “Yes,<br>that’s what I expected and feared.”<br><br>“Is she clever?” she asked.<br><br>Pierre considered.<br><br>“I think not,” he said, “and yet—yes. She does not deign to be<br>clever.... Oh no, she is simply enchanting, and that is all.”<br><br>Princess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.<br><br>“Ah, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you see her before I do.”<br><br>“I hear they are expected very soon,” said Pierre.<br><br>Princess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future<br>sister-in-law as soon as the Rostóvs arrived and to try to accustom the<br>old prince to her.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>Borís had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg, so<br>with the same object in view he came to Moscow. There he wavered between<br>the two richest heiresses, Julie and Princess Mary. Though Princess<br>Mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than Julie, he,<br>without knowing why, felt awkward about paying court to her. When they<br>had last met on the old prince’s name day, she had answered at random<br>all his attempts to talk sentimentally, evidently not listening to what<br>he was saying.<br><br>Julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily, though in a<br>manner peculiar to herself.<br><br>She was twenty-seven. After the death of her brothers she had become<br>very wealthy. She was by now decidedly plain, but thought herself not<br>merely as good-looking as before but even far more attractive. She<br>was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very<br>wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less<br>dangerous she became to men, and the more freely they could associate<br>with her and avail themselves of her suppers, soirees, and the animated<br>company that assembled at her house, without incurring any obligation.<br>A man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day<br>to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there, for fear of<br>compromising her and committing himself, would now go boldly every day<br>and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance.<br><br>That winter the Karágins’ house was the most agreeable and hospitable<br>in Moscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner parties, a large<br>company, chiefly of men, gathered there every day, supping at midnight<br>and staying till three in the morning. Julie never missed a ball, a<br>promenade, or a play. Her dresses were always of the latest fashion.<br>But in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and<br>told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love,<br>or any of the joys of life, and expected peace only “yonder.” She<br>adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment, like a<br>girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by<br>him. Though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in<br>that light, and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered<br>much in life. This melancholy, which did not prevent her amusing<br>herself, did not hinder the young people who came to her house from<br>passing the time pleasantly. Every visitor who came to the house paid<br>his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess, and then amused<br>himself with society gossip, dancing, intellectual games, and bouts<br>rimés, which were in vogue at the Karágins’. Only a few of these<br>young men, among them Borís, entered more deeply into Julie’s<br>melancholy, and with these she had prolonged conversations in private<br>on the vanity of all worldly things, and to them she showed her albums<br>filled with mournful sketches, maxims, and verses.<br><br>To Borís, Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his early<br>disillusionment with life, offered him such consolation of friendship<br>as she who had herself suffered so much could render, and showed him<br>her album. Borís sketched two trees in the album and wrote: “Rustic<br>trees, your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me.”<br><br>On another page he drew a tomb, and wrote:<br><br>    La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.<br>    Ah! contre les douleurs il n’y a pas d’autre asile. *<br><br>    * Death gives relief and death is peaceful.<br><br>Ah! from suffering there is no other refuge.<br><br>Julie said this was charming<br><br>“There is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy,” she<br>said to Borís, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a<br>book. “It is a ray of light in the darkness, a shade between sadness<br>and despair, showing the possibility of consolation.”<br><br>In reply Borís wrote these lines:<br><br>    Aliment de poison d’une âme trop sensible,<br>    Toi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,<br>    Tendre mélancholie, ah, viens me consoler,<br>    Viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,<br>    Et mêle une douceur secrète<br>    A ces pleurs que je sens couler. *<br><br>      *Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul,<br>     Thou, without whom happiness would for me be impossible,<br>     Tender melancholy, ah, come to console me,<br>     Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat,<br>     And mingle a secret sweetness<br>     With these tears that I feel to be flowing.<br><br>For Borís, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp. Borís<br>read Poor Liza aloud to her, and more than once interrupted the reading<br>because of the emotions that choked him. Meeting at large gatherings<br>Julie and Borís looked on one another as the only souls who understood<br>one another in a world of indifferent people.<br><br>Anna Mikháylovna, who often visited the Karágins, while playing cards<br>with the mother made careful inquiries as to Julie’s dowry (she was<br>to have two estates in Pénza and the Nizhegórod forests). Anna<br>Mikháylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the<br>wealthy Julie with emotion, and resignation to the Divine will.<br><br>“You are always charming and melancholy, my dear Julie,” she said to<br>the daughter. “Borís says his soul finds repose at your house. He has<br>suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive,” said she to<br>the mother. “Ah, my dear, I can’t tell you how fond I have grown<br>of Julie latterly,” she said to her son. “But who could help loving<br>her? She is an angelic being! Ah, Borís, Borís!”—she paused.<br>“And how I pity her mother,” she went on; “today she showed me her<br>accounts and letters from Pénza (they have enormous estates there), and<br>she, poor thing, has no one to help her, and they do cheat her so!”<br><br>Borís smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother. He<br>laughed blandly at her naïve diplomacy but listened to what she had<br>to say, and sometimes questioned her carefully about the Pénza and<br>Nizhegórod estates.<br><br>Julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and<br>was ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of repulsion for her,<br>for her passionate desire to get married, for her artificiality, and<br>a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still<br>restrained Borís. His leave was expiring. He spent every day and whole<br>days at the Karágins’, and every day on thinking the matter over<br>told himself that he would propose tomorrow. But in Julie’s presence,<br>looking at her red face and chin (nearly always powdered), her moist<br>eyes, and her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from<br>melancholy to an unnatural rapture of married bliss, Borís could not<br>utter the decisive words, though in imagination he had long regarded<br>himself as the possessor of those Pénza and Nizhegórod estates and<br>had apportioned the use of the income from them. Julie saw Borís’<br>indecision, and sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was<br>repulsive to him, but her feminine self-deception immediately supplied<br>her with consolation, and she told herself that he was only shy from<br>love. Her melancholy, however, began to turn to irritability, and not<br>long before Borís’ departure she formed a definite plan of action.<br>Just as Borís’ leave of absence was expiring, Anatole Kurágin made<br>his appearance in Moscow, and of course in the Karágins’ drawing<br>room, and Julie, suddenly abandoning her melancholy, became cheerful and<br>very attentive to Kurágin.<br><br>“My dear,” said Anna Mikháylovna to her son, “I know from a<br>reliable source that Prince Vasíli has sent his son to Moscow to get<br>him married to Julie. I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for<br>her. What do you think of it, my dear?”<br><br>The idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole<br>month of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of seeing all<br>the revenue from the Pénza estates which he had already mentally<br>apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another, and<br>especially into the hands of that idiot Anatole, pained Borís. He drove<br>to the Karágins’ with the firm intention of proposing. Julie met<br>him in a gay, careless manner, spoke casually of how she had enjoyed<br>yesterday’s ball, and asked when he was leaving. Though Borís had<br>come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant to be<br>tender, he began speaking irritably of feminine inconstancy, of how<br>easily women can turn from sadness to joy, and how their moods depend<br>solely on who happens to be paying court to them. Julie was offended and<br>replied that it was true that a woman needs variety, and the same thing<br>over and over again would weary anyone.<br><br>“Then I should advise you...” Borís began, wishing to sting her;<br>but at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might<br>have to leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim, and have<br>vainly wasted his efforts—which was a thing he never allowed to<br>happen.<br><br>He checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered his eyes to<br>avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and said:<br><br>“I did not come here at all to quarrel with you. On the contrary...”<br><br>He glanced at her to make sure that he might go on. Her irritability had<br>suddenly quite vanished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were fixed on<br>him with greedy expectation. “I can always arrange so as not to see<br>her often,” thought Borís. “The affair has been begun and must be<br>finished!” He blushed hotly, raised his eyes to hers, and said:<br><br>“You know my feelings for you!”<br><br>There was no need to say more: Julie’s face shone with triumph and<br>self-satisfaction; but she forced Borís to say all that is said on such<br>occasions—that he loved her and had never loved any other woman more<br>than her. She knew that for the Pénza estates and Nizhegórod forests<br>she could demand this, and she received what she demanded.<br><br>The affianced couple, no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and<br>melancholy upon them, planned the arrangements of a splendid house in<br>Petersburg, paid calls, and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>At the end of January old Count Rostóv went to Moscow with Natásha and<br>Sónya. The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was<br>impossible to wait for her recovery. Prince Andrew was expected in<br>Moscow any day, the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near<br>Moscow had to be sold, besides which the opportunity of presenting his<br>future daughter-in-law to old Prince Bolkónski while he was in Moscow<br>could not be missed. The Rostóvs’ Moscow house had not been heated<br>that winter and, as they had come only for a short time and the countess<br>was not with them, the count decided to stay with Márya Dmítrievna<br>Akhrosímova, who had long been pressing her hospitality on them.<br><br>Late one evening the Rostóvs’ four sleighs drove into Márya<br>Dmítrievna’s courtyard in the old Konyúsheny street. Márya<br>Dmítrievna lived alone. She had already married off her daughter, and<br>her sons were all in the service.<br><br>She held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly,<br>loudly, and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach<br>to others for any weakness, passion, or temptation—the possibility of<br>which she did not admit. From early in the morning, wearing a dressing<br>jacket, she attended to her household affairs, and then she drove out:<br>on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on<br>affairs of which she never spoke to anyone. On ordinary days, after<br>dressing, she received petitioners of various classes, of whom there<br>were always some. Then she had dinner, a substantial and appetizing meal<br>at which there were always three or four guests; after dinner she played<br>a game of boston, and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read<br>to her while she knitted. She rarely made an exception and went out to<br>pay visits, and then only to the most important persons in the town.<br><br>She had not yet gone to bed when the Rostóvs arrived and the pulley of<br>the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the Rostóvs and their<br>servants. Márya Dmítrievna, with her spectacles hanging down on her<br>nose and her head flung back, stood in the hall doorway looking with<br>a stern, grim face at the new arrivals. One might have thought she was<br>angry with the travelers and would immediately turn them out, had she<br>not at the same time been giving careful instructions to the servants<br>for the accommodation of the visitors and their belongings.<br><br>“The count’s things? Bring them here,” she said, pointing to the<br>portmanteaus and not greeting anyone. “The young ladies’? There<br>to the left. Now what are you dawdling for?” she cried to the maids.<br>“Get the samovar ready!... You’ve grown plumper and prettier,” she<br>remarked, drawing Natásha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold)<br>to her by the hood. “Foo! You are cold! Now take off your things,<br>quick!” she shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand.<br>“You’re half frozen, I’m sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour,<br>Sónya dear!” she added, turning to Sónya and indicating by this<br>French greeting her slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude<br>toward her.<br><br>When they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things and<br>tidied themselves up after their journey, Márya Dmítrievna kissed them<br>all in due order.<br><br>“I’m heartily glad you have come and are staying with me. It was<br>high time,” she said, giving Natásha a significant look. “The old<br>man is here and his son’s expected any day. You’ll have to make his<br>acquaintance. But we’ll speak of that later on,” she added, glancing<br>at Sónya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her<br>presence. “Now listen,” she said to the count. “What do you want<br>tomorrow? Whom will you send for? Shinshín?” she crooked one of her<br>fingers. “The sniveling Anna Mikháylovna? That’s two. She’s here<br>with her son. The son is getting married! Then Bezúkhov, eh? He is here<br>too, with his wife. He ran away from her and she came galloping after<br>him. He dined with me on Wednesday. As for them”—and she pointed to<br>the girls—“tomorrow I’ll take them first to the Iberian shrine<br>of the Mother of God, and then we’ll drive to the Super-Rogue’s.<br>I suppose you’ll have everything new. Don’t judge by me: sleeves<br>nowadays are this size! The other day young Princess Irína Vasílevna<br>came to see me; she was an awful sight—looked as if she had put two<br>barrels on her arms. You know not a day passes now without some new<br>fashion.... And what have you to do yourself?” she asked the count<br>sternly.<br><br>“One thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, and now a<br>purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house. If you<br>will be so kind, I’ll fix a time and go down to the estate just for a<br>day, and leave my lassies with you.”<br><br>“All right. All right. They’ll be safe with me, as safe as in<br>Chancery! I’ll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and<br>pet them a bit,” said Márya Dmítrievna, touching her goddaughter and<br>favorite, Natásha, on the cheek with her large hand.<br><br>Next morning Márya Dmítrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian<br>shrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, who was so<br>afraid of Márya Dmítrievna that she always let her have costumes at<br>a loss merely to get rid of her. Márya Dmítrievna ordered almost the<br>whole trousseau. When they got home she turned everybody out of the room<br>except Natásha, and then called her pet to her armchair.<br><br>“Well, now we’ll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed.<br>You’ve hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I’ve known<br>him since he was so high.” She held her hand a couple of feet from the<br>ground. Natásha blushed happily. “I like him and all his family.<br>Now listen! You know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son’s<br>marrying. The old fellow’s crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not<br>a child and can shift without him, but it’s not nice to enter a family<br>against a father’s will. One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly.<br>You’re a clever girl and you’ll know how to manage. Be kind, and use<br>your wits. Then all will be well.”<br><br>Natásha remained silent, from shyness Márya Dmítrievna supposed, but<br>really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love<br>of Prince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs<br>that no one could understand it. She loved and knew Prince Andrew, he<br>loved her only, and was to come one of these days and take her. She<br>wanted nothing more.<br><br>“You see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary, your<br>future sister-in-law. ‘Husbands’ sisters bring up blisters,’<br>but this one wouldn’t hurt a fly. She has asked me to bring you two<br>together. Tomorrow you’ll go with your father to see her. Be very<br>nice and affectionate to her: you’re younger than she. When he comes,<br>he’ll find you already know his sister and father and are liked by<br>them. Am I right or not? Won’t that be best?”<br><br>“Yes, it will,” Natásha answered reluctantly.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>Next day, by Márya Dmítrievna’s advice, Count Rostóv took Natásha<br>to call on Prince Nicholas Bolkónski. The count did not set out<br>cheerfully on this visit, at heart he felt afraid. He well remembered<br>the last interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the<br>enrollment, when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to<br>listen to an angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of<br>men. Natásha, on the other hand, having put on her best gown, was in<br>the highest spirits. “They can’t help liking me,” she thought.<br>“Everybody always has liked me, and I am so willing to do anything<br>they wish, so ready to be fond of him—for being his father—and of<br>her—for being his sister—that there is no reason for them not to<br>like me....”<br><br>They drove up to the gloomy old house on the Vozdvízhenka and entered<br>the vestibule.<br><br>“Well, the Lord have mercy on us!” said the count, half in jest,<br>half in earnest; but Natásha noticed that her father was flurried on<br>entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince<br>and princess were at home.<br><br>When they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the<br>servants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by<br>another in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a<br>maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning<br>the princess. At last an old, cross looking footman came and announced<br>to the Rostóvs that the prince was not receiving, but that the princess<br>begged them to walk up. The first person who came to meet the visitors<br>was Mademoiselle Bourienne. She greeted the father and daughter<br>with special politeness and showed them to the princess’ room. The<br>princess, looking excited and nervous, her face flushed in patches, ran<br>in to meet the visitors, treading heavily, and vainly trying to appear<br>cordial and at ease. From the first glance Princess Mary did not like<br>Natásha. She thought her too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and<br>vain. She did not at all realize that before having seen her future<br>sister-in-law she was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her<br>beauty, youth, and happiness, as well as by jealousy of her brother’s<br>love for her. Apart from this insuperable antipathy to her, Princess<br>Mary was agitated just then because on the Rostóvs’ being announced,<br>the old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them, that<br>Princess Mary might do so if she chose, but they were not to be admitted<br>to him. She had decided to receive them, but feared lest the prince<br>might at any moment indulge in some freak, as he seemed much upset by<br>the Rostóvs’ visit.<br><br>“There, my dear princess, I’ve brought you my songstress,” said<br>the count, bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince<br>might appear. “I am so glad you should get to know one another... very<br>sorry the prince is still ailing,” and after a few more commonplace<br>remarks he rose. “If you’ll allow me to leave my Natásha in your<br>hands for a quarter of an hour, Princess, I’ll drive round to see Anna<br>Semënovna, it’s quite near in the Dogs’ Square, and then I’ll<br>come back for her.”<br><br>The count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told his<br>daughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk<br>to one another freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of<br>encountering the old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention<br>this to his daughter, but Natásha noticed her father’s nervousness<br>and anxiety and felt mortified by it. She blushed for him, grew still<br>angrier at having blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold and<br>defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody. The<br>princess told the count that she would be delighted, and only begged him<br>to stay longer at Anna Semënovna’s, and he departed.<br><br>Despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Mary—who wished<br>to have a tête-à-tête with Natásha—Mademoiselle Bourienne<br>remained in the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements and<br>theaters. Natásha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in<br>the anteroom, by her father’s nervousness, and by the unnatural manner<br>of the princess who—she thought—was making a favor of receiving her,<br>and so everything displeased her. She did not like Princess Mary, whom<br>she thought very plain, affected, and dry. Natásha suddenly shrank<br>into herself and involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated<br>Princess Mary still more. After five minutes of irksome, constrained<br>conversation, they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly<br>approaching. Princess Mary looked frightened.<br><br>The door opened and the old prince, in a dressing gown and a white<br>nightcap, came in.<br><br>“Ah, madam!” he began. “Madam, Countess... Countess Rostóva, if<br>I am not mistaken... I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me... I did not<br>know, madam. God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with<br>a visit, and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter. I beg you<br>to excuse me... God is my witness, I didn’t know—” he repeated,<br>stressing the word “God” so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that<br>Princess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her<br>father or at Natásha.<br><br>Nor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, know what to do.<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably.<br><br>“I beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I did not<br>know,” muttered the old man, and after looking Natásha over from head<br>to foot he went out.<br><br>Mademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this<br>apparition and began speaking about the prince’s indisposition.<br>Natásha and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence, and the<br>longer they did so without saying what they wanted to say, the greater<br>grew their antipathy to one another.<br><br>When the count returned, Natásha was impolitely pleased and hastened<br>to get away: at that moment she hated the stiff, elderly princess, who<br>could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an<br>hour with her without once mentioning Prince Andrew. “I couldn’t<br>begin talking about him in the presence of that Frenchwoman,” thought<br>Natásha. The same thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary. She<br>knew what she ought to have said to Natásha, but she had been unable<br>to say it because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, and because,<br>without knowing why, she felt it very difficult to speak of the<br>marriage. When the count was already leaving the room, Princess Mary<br>went up hurriedly to Natásha, took her by the hand, and said with a<br>deep sigh:<br><br>“Wait, I must...”<br><br>Natásha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.<br><br>“Dear Natalie,” said Princess Mary, “I want you to know that I am<br>glad my brother has found happiness....”<br><br>She paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth. Natásha noticed<br>this and guessed its reason.<br><br>“I think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now,”<br>she said with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears<br>choking her.<br><br>“What have I said and what have I done?” thought she, as soon as she<br>was out of the room.<br><br>They waited a long time for Natásha to come to dinner that day. She sat<br>in her room crying like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing. Sónya<br>stood beside her, kissing her hair.<br><br>“Natásha, what is it about?” she asked. “What do they matter to<br>you? It will all pass, Natásha.”<br><br>“But if you only knew how offensive it was... as if I...”<br><br>“Don’t talk about it, Natásha. It wasn’t your fault so why should<br>you mind? Kiss me,” said Sónya.<br><br>Natásha raised her head and, kissing her friend on the lips, pressed<br>her wet face against her.<br><br>“I can’t tell you, I don’t know. No one’s to blame,” said<br>Natásha—“It’s my fault. But it all hurts terribly. Oh, why<br>doesn’t he come?...”<br><br>She came in to dinner with red eyes. Márya Dmítrievna, who knew how<br>the prince had received the Rostóvs, pretended not to notice how upset<br>Natásha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count<br>and the other guests.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>That evening the Rostóvs went to the Opera, for which Márya<br>Dmítrievna had taken a box.<br><br>Natásha did not want to go, but could not refuse Márya Dmítrievna’s<br>kind offer which was intended expressly for her. When she came ready<br>dressed into the ballroom to await her father, and looking in the large<br>mirror there saw that she was pretty, very pretty, she felt even more<br>sad, but it was a sweet, tender sadness.<br><br>“O God, if he were here now I would not behave as I did then, but<br>differently. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I would simply<br>embrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with those searching<br>inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me, and then I<br>would make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyes—how I see those<br>eyes!” thought Natásha. “And what do his father and sister matter<br>to me? I love him alone, him, him, with that face and those eyes, with<br>his smile, manly and yet childlike.... No, I had better not think of<br>him; not think of him but forget him, quite forget him for the present.<br>I can’t bear this waiting and I shall cry in a minute!” and she<br>turned away from the glass, making an effort not to cry. “And how<br>can Sónya love Nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so long and so<br>patiently?” thought she, looking at Sónya, who also came in quite<br>ready, with a fan in her hand. “No, she’s altogether different. I<br>can’t!”<br><br>Natásha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not<br>enough for her to love and know she was beloved, she wanted now, at<br>once, to embrace the man she loved, to speak and hear from him words of<br>love such as filled her heart. While she sat in the carriage beside her<br>father, pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on<br>the frozen window, she felt still sadder and more in love, and forgot<br>where she was going and with whom. Having fallen into the line of<br>carriages, the Rostóvs’ carriage drove up to the theater, its wheels<br>squeaking over the snow. Natásha and Sónya, holding up their dresses,<br>jumped out quickly. The count got out helped by the footmen, and,<br>passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers,<br>they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes.<br>Through the closed doors the music was already audible.<br><br>“Natásha, your hair!...” whispered Sónya.<br><br>An attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and<br>opened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the<br>door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and<br>shoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered before<br>their eyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy<br>at Natásha. The curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being<br>played. Natásha, smoothing her gown, went in with Sónya and sat down,<br>scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite. A sensation she had not<br>experienced for a long time—that of hundreds of eyes looking at<br>her bare arms and neck—suddenly affected her both agreeably and<br>disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories, desires and<br>emotions associated with that feeling.<br><br>The two remarkably pretty girls, Natásha and Sónya, with Count Rostóv<br>who had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted general<br>attention. Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of Natásha’s engagement<br>to Prince Andrew, and knew that the Rostóvs had lived in the country<br>ever since, and all looked with curiosity at a fiancée who was making<br>one of the best matches in Russia.<br><br>Natásha’s looks, as everyone told her, had improved in the country,<br>and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty.<br>She struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty,<br>combined with her indifference to everything about her. Her black eyes<br>looked at the crowd without seeking anyone, and her delicate arm, bare<br>to above the elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the box, while, evidently<br>unconsciously, she opened and closed her hand in time to the music,<br>crumpling her program. “Look, there’s Alénina,” said Sónya,<br>“with her mother, isn’t it?”<br><br>“Dear me, Michael Kirílovich has grown still stouter!” remarked the<br>count.<br><br>“Look at our Anna Mikháylovna—what a headdress she has on!”<br><br>“The Karágins, Julie—and Borís with them. One can see at once that<br>they’re engaged....”<br><br>“Drubetskóy has proposed?”<br><br>“Oh yes, I heard it today,” said Shinshín, coming into the<br>Rostóvs’ box.<br><br>Natásha looked in the direction in which her father’s eyes were<br>turned and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her<br>face and a string of pearls round her thick red neck—which Natásha<br>knew was covered with powder. Behind them, wearing a smile and leaning<br>over with an ear to Julie’s mouth, was Borís’ handsome smoothly<br>brushed head. He looked at the Rostóvs from under his brows and said<br>something, smiling, to his betrothed.<br><br>“They are talking about us, about me and him!” thought Natásha.<br>“And he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They needn’t trouble<br>themselves! If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of<br>them.”<br><br>Behind them sat Anna Mikháylovna wearing a green headdress and with a<br>happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face. Their box was<br>pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which Natásha knew<br>so well and liked so much. She turned away and suddenly remembered all<br>that had been so humiliating in her morning’s visit.<br><br>“What right has he not to wish to receive me into his family? Oh,<br>better not think of it—not till he comes back!” she told herself,<br>and began looking at the faces, some strange and some familiar, in<br>the stalls. In the front, in the very center, leaning back against<br>the orchestra rail, stood Dólokhov in a Persian dress, his curly hair<br>brushed up into a huge shock. He stood in full view of the audience,<br>well aware that he was attracting everyone’s attention, yet as much at<br>ease as though he were in his own room. Around him thronged Moscow’s<br>most brilliant young men, whom he evidently dominated.<br><br>The count, laughing, nudged the blushing Sónya and pointed to her<br>former adorer.<br><br>“Do you recognize him?” said he. “And where has he sprung from?”<br>he asked, turning to Shinshín. “Didn’t he vanish somewhere?”<br><br>“He did,” replied Shinshín. “He was in the Caucasus and ran<br>away from there. They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling<br>prince in Persia, where he killed the Shah’s brother. Now all the<br>Moscow ladies are mad about him! It’s ‘Dólokhov the Persian’ that<br>does it! We never hear a word but Dólokhov is mentioned. They swear<br>by him, they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet.<br>Dólokhov and Anatole Kurágin have turned all our ladies’ heads.”<br><br>A tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed<br>plump white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double string of<br>large pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress<br>and took a long time settling into her place.<br><br>Natásha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those shoulders, and pearls<br>and coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls.<br>While Natásha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady<br>looked round and, meeting the count’s eyes, nodded to him and smiled.<br>She was the Countess Bezúkhova, Pierre’s wife, and the count, who<br>knew everyone in society, leaned over and spoke to her.<br><br>“Have you been here long, Countess?” he inquired. “I’ll call,<br>I’ll call to kiss your hand. I’m here on business and have brought<br>my girls with me. They say Semënova acts marvelously. Count Pierre<br>never used to forget us. Is he here?”<br><br>“Yes, he meant to look in,” answered Hélène, and glanced<br>attentively at Natásha.<br><br>Count Rostóv resumed his seat.<br><br>“Handsome, isn’t she?” he whispered to Natásha.<br><br>“Wonderful!” answered Natásha. “She’s a woman one could easily<br>fall in love with.”<br><br>Just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor<br>tapped with his stick. Some latecomers took their seats in the stalls,<br>and the curtain rose.<br><br>As soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent, and<br>all the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress, and all the<br>women with gems on their bare flesh, turned their whole attention with<br>eager curiosity to the stage. Natásha too began to look at it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at the sides was<br>some painted cardboard representing trees, and at the back was a cloth<br>stretched over boards. In the center of the stage sat some girls in red<br>bodices and white skirts. One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat<br>apart on a low bench, to the back of which a piece of green cardboard<br>was glued. They all sang something. When they had finished their song<br>the girl in white went up to the prompter’s box and a man with tight<br>silk trousers over his stout legs, and holding a plume and a dagger,<br>went up to her and began singing, waving his arms about.<br><br>First the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang, then they<br>both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand<br>of the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with<br>her. They sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping<br>and shouting, while the man and woman on the stage—who represented<br>lovers—began smiling, spreading out their arms, and bowing.<br><br>After her life in the country, and in her present serious mood, all this<br>seemed grotesque and amazing to Natásha. She could not follow the opera<br>nor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted cardboard and the<br>queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke, and sang so strangely in<br>that brilliant light. She knew what it was all meant to represent, but<br>it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed<br>for the actors and then amused at them. She looked at the faces of the<br>audience, seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she<br>herself experienced, but they all seemed attentive to what was happening<br>on the stage, and expressed delight which to Natásha seemed feigned.<br>“I suppose it has to be like this!” she thought. She kept looking<br>round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at<br>the seminude women in the boxes, especially at Hélène in the next box,<br>who—apparently quite unclothed—sat with a quiet tranquil smile, not<br>taking her eyes off the stage. And feeling the bright light that flooded<br>the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd, Natásha little<br>by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not<br>experienced for a long while. She did not realize who and where she<br>was, nor what was going on before her. As she looked and thought, the<br>strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her<br>mind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and<br>singing the air the actress was singing, then she wished to touch with<br>her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then to lean over to<br>Hélène and tickle her.<br><br>At a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song, a door<br>leading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rostóvs’ box creaked,<br>and the steps of a belated arrival were heard. “There’s Kurágin!”<br>whispered Shinshín. Countess Bezúkhova turned smiling to the newcomer,<br>and Natásha, following the direction of that look, saw an exceptionally<br>handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured yet<br>courteous bearing. This was Anatole Kurágin whom she had seen<br>and noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg. He was now in an<br>adjutant’s uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot. He moved with<br>a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been<br>so good-looking and had his handsome face not worn such an expression<br>of good-humored complacency and gaiety. Though the performance was<br>proceeding, he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway, his sword<br>and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high.<br>Having looked at Natásha he approached his sister, laid his well gloved<br>hand on the edge of her box, nodded to her, and leaning forward asked a<br>question, with a motion toward Natásha.<br><br>“Mais charmante!” said he, evidently referring to Natásha, who did<br>not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his<br>lips. Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down<br>beside Dólokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way<br>that Dólokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He winked at him gaily,<br>smiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra screen.<br><br>“How like the brother is to the sister,” remarked the count. “And<br>how handsome they both are!”<br><br>Shinshín, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some intrigue<br>of Kurágin’s in Moscow, and Natásha tried to overhear it just<br>because he had said she was “charmante.”<br><br>The first act was over. In the stalls everyone began moving about, going<br>out and coming in.<br><br>Borís came to the Rostóvs’ box, received their congratulations very<br>simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile conveyed to<br>Natásha and Sónya his fiancée’s invitation to her wedding, and<br>went away. Natásha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and<br>congratulated on his approaching wedding that same Borís with whom<br>she had formerly been in love. In the state of intoxication she was in,<br>everything seemed simple and natural.<br><br>The scantily clad Hélène smiled at everyone in the same way, and<br>Natásha gave Borís a similar smile.<br><br>Hélène’s box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most<br>distinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another<br>in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her.<br><br>During the whole of that entr’acte Kurágin stood with Dólokhov<br>in front of the orchestra partition, looking at the Rostóvs’ box.<br>Natásha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure.<br>She even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought<br>was its most becoming aspect. Before the beginning of the second act<br>Pierre appeared in the stalls. The Rostóvs had not seen him since<br>their arrival. His face looked sad, and he had grown still stouter since<br>Natásha last saw him. He passed up to the front rows, not noticing<br>anyone. Anatole went up to him and began speaking to him, looking at and<br>indicating the Rostóvs’ box. On seeing Natásha Pierre grew animated<br>and, hastily passing between the rows, came toward their box. When he<br>got there he leaned on his elbows and, smiling, talked to her for a long<br>time. While conversing with Pierre, Natásha heard a man’s voice in<br>Countess Bezúkhova’s box and something told her it was Kurágin. She<br>turned and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he gazed straight into her<br>eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be<br>so near him, to look at him like that, to be so sure he admired her, and<br>not to be acquainted with him.<br><br>In the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there was a<br>round hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were raised over<br>the footlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many<br>people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding<br>things like daggers in their hands. They began waving their arms. Then<br>some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been<br>in white and was now in light blue. They did not drag her away at once,<br>but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off, and<br>behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and<br>everyone knelt down and sang a prayer. All these things were repeatedly<br>interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience.<br><br>During this act every time Natásha looked toward the stalls she saw<br>Anatole Kurágin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair,<br>staring at her. She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and<br>it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it.<br><br>When the second act was over Countess Bezúkhova rose, turned to the<br>Rostóvs’ box—her whole bosom completely exposed—beckoned the old<br>count with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to those who had<br>entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile.<br><br>“Do make me acquainted with your charming daughters,” said she.<br>“The whole town is singing their praises and I don’t even know<br>them!”<br><br>Natásha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess. She was so pleased<br>by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure.<br><br>“I want to become a Moscovite too, now,” said Hélène. “How is it<br>you’re not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?”<br><br>Countess Bezúkhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating<br>woman. She could say what she did not think—especially what was<br>flattering—quite simply and naturally.<br><br>“Dear count, you must let me look after your daughters! Though I am<br>not staying here long this time—nor are you—I will try to amuse<br>them. I have already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get<br>to know you,” said she to Natásha with her stereotyped and lovely<br>smile. “I had heard about you from my page, Drubetskóy. Have you<br>heard he is getting married? And also from my husband’s friend<br>Bolkónski, Prince Andrew Bolkónski,” she went on with special<br>emphasis, implying that she knew of his relation to Natásha. To get<br>better acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come<br>into her box for the rest of the performance, and Natásha moved over to<br>it.<br><br>The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles<br>were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the<br>walls. In the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen. The<br>king waved his right arm and, evidently nervous, sang something badly<br>and sat down on a crimson throne. The maiden who had been first in white<br>and then in light blue, now wore only a smock, and stood beside the<br>throne with her hair down. She sang something mournfully, addressing the<br>queen, but the king waved his arm severely, and men and women with bare<br>legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together. Then the<br>violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick<br>bare legs and thin arms, separating from the others, went behind the<br>wings, adjusted her bodice, returned to the middle of the stage, and<br>began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other. In the<br>stalls everyone clapped and shouted “bravo!” Then one of the men<br>went into a corner of the stage. The cymbals and horns in the orchestra<br>struck up more loudly, and this man with bare legs jumped very high and<br>waved his feet about very rapidly. (He was Duport, who received sixty<br>thousand rubles a year for this art.) Everybody in the stalls, boxes,<br>and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might, and the<br>man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides. Then other men<br>and women danced with bare legs. Then the king again shouted to the<br>sound of music, and they all began singing. But suddenly a storm<br>came on, chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the<br>orchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of their number away,<br>and the curtain dropped. Once more there was a terrible noise and<br>clatter among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone began<br>shouting: “Duport! Duport! Duport!” Natásha no longer thought this<br>strange. She looked about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.<br><br>“Isn’t Duport delightful?” Hélène asked her.<br><br>“Oh, yes,” replied Natásha.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>During the entr’acte a whiff of cold air came into Hélène’s box,<br>the door opened, and Anatole entered, stooping and trying not to brush<br>against anyone.<br><br>“Let me introduce my brother to you,” said Hélène, her eyes<br>shifting uneasily from Natásha to Anatole.<br><br>Natásha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer<br>and smiled at him over her bare shoulder. Anatole, who was as handsome<br>at close quarters as at a distance, sat down beside her and told her he<br>had long wished to have this happiness—ever since the Narýshkins’<br>ball in fact, at which he had had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing<br>her. Kurágin was much more sensible and simple with women than among<br>men. He talked boldly and naturally, and Natásha was strangely and<br>agreeably struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this<br>man about whom there was so much talk, but that on the contrary his<br>smile was most naïve, cheerful, and good-natured.<br><br>Kurágin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a<br>previous performance Semënova had fallen down on the stage.<br><br>“And do you know, Countess,” he said, suddenly addressing her as an<br>old, familiar acquaintance, “we are getting up a costume tournament;<br>you ought to take part in it! It will be great fun. We shall all meet at<br>the Karágins’! Please come! No! Really, eh?” said he.<br><br>While saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face,<br>her neck, and her bare arms. Natásha knew for certain that he was<br>enraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel<br>constrained and oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt that<br>he was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his eye<br>so that he should look into hers rather than this. But looking into his<br>eyes she was frightened, realizing that there was not that barrier of<br>modesty she had always felt between herself and other men. She did not<br>know how it was that within five minutes she had come to feel herself<br>terribly near to this man. When she turned away she feared he might<br>seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck. They<br>spoke of most ordinary things, yet she felt that they were closer to<br>one another than she had ever been to any man. Natásha kept turning to<br>Hélène and to her father, as if asking what it all meant, but Hélène<br>was engaged in conversation with a general and did not answer her<br>look, and her father’s eyes said nothing but what they always said:<br>“Having a good time? Well, I’m glad of it!”<br><br>During one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatole’s<br>prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, Natásha, to break<br>the silence, asked him how he liked Moscow. She asked the question and<br>blushed. She felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing<br>something improper. Anatole smiled as though to encourage her.<br><br>“At first I did not like it much, because what makes a town pleasant<br>ce sont les jolies femmes, * isn’t that so? But now I like it very<br>much indeed,” he said, looking at her significantly. “You’ll come<br>to the costume tournament, Countess? Do come!” and putting out his<br>hand to her bouquet and dropping his voice, he added, “You will be the<br>prettiest there. Do come, dear countess, and give me this flower as a<br>pledge!”<br><br>    * Are the pretty women.<br><br>Natásha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did<br>himself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper<br>intention. She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had<br>not heard his remark. But as soon as she had turned away she felt that<br>he was there, behind, so close behind her.<br><br>“How is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?” she<br>asked herself, and she could not refrain from turning round. She looked<br>straight into his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, and the<br>good-natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her. She smiled just<br>as he was doing, gazing straight into his eyes. And again she felt with<br>horror that no barrier lay between him and her.<br><br>The curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, serene and gay. Natásha<br>went back to her father in the other box, now quite submissive to the<br>world she found herself in. All that was going on before her now seemed<br>quite natural, but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her<br>betrothed, of Princess Mary, or of life in the country did not once<br>recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past.<br><br>In the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm<br>about, till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared<br>down below. That was the only part of the fourth act that Natásha saw.<br>She felt agitated and tormented, and the cause of this was Kurágin whom<br>she could not help watching. As they were leaving the theater Anatole<br>came up to them, called their carriage, and helped them in. As he was<br>putting Natásha in he pressed her arm above the elbow. Agitated and<br>flushed she turned round. He was looking at her with glittering eyes,<br>smiling tenderly.<br><br><br>Only after she had reached home was Natásha able clearly to think over<br>what had happened to her, and suddenly remembering Prince Andrew she<br>was horrified, and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera, she<br>gave a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the room.<br><br>“O God! I am lost!” she said to herself. “How could I let him?”<br>She sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to<br>realize what had happened to her, but was unable either to understand<br>what had happened or what she felt. Everything seemed dark, obscure,<br>and terrible. There in that enormous, illuminated theater where the<br>bare-legged Duport, in a tinsel-decorated jacket, jumped about to the<br>music on wet boards, and young girls and old men, and the nearly<br>naked Hélène with her proud, calm smile, rapturously cried<br>“bravo!”—there in the presence of that Hélène it had all seemed<br>clear and simple; but now, alone by herself, it was incomprehensible.<br>“What is it? What was that terror I felt of him? What is this gnawing<br>of conscience I am feeling now?” she thought.<br><br>Only to the old countess at night in bed could Natásha have told all<br>she was feeling. She knew that Sónya with her severe and simple views<br>would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such<br>a confession. So Natásha tried to solve what was torturing her by<br>herself.<br><br>“Am I spoiled for Andrew’s love or not?” she asked herself, and<br>with soothing irony replied: “What a fool I am to ask that! What did<br>happen to me? Nothing! I have done nothing, I didn’t lead him on<br>at all. Nobody will know and I shall never see him again,” she told<br>herself. “So it is plain that nothing has happened and there is<br>nothing to repent of, and Andrew can love me still. But why ‘still?’<br>O God, why isn’t he here?” Natásha quieted herself for a moment,<br>but again some instinct told her that though all this was true, and<br>though nothing had happened, yet the former purity of her love for<br>Prince Andrew had perished. And again in imagination she went over her<br>whole conversation with Kurágin, and again saw the face, gestures, and<br>tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>Anatole Kurágin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him<br>away from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles<br>a year in cash, besides running up debts for as much more, which his<br>creditors demanded from his father.<br><br>His father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the<br>last time, but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant to<br>the commander in chief—a post his father had procured for him—and<br>would at last try to make a good match there. He indicated to him<br>Princess Mary and Julie Karágina.<br><br>Anatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre’s<br>house. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him<br>after a while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and gave<br>him money under the guise of loans.<br><br>As Shinshín had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had<br>turned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that<br>he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French<br>actresses—with the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to<br>be on intimate relations. He had never missed a carousal at Danílov’s<br>or other Moscow revelers’, drank whole nights through, outvying<br>everyone else, and was at all the balls and parties of the best society.<br>There was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies, and he flirted<br>with a few of them at the balls. But he did not run after the unmarried<br>girls, especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain.<br>There was a special reason for this, as he had got married two years<br>before—a fact known only to his most intimate friends. At that time<br>while with his regiment in Poland, a Polish landowner of small means had<br>forced him to marry his daughter. Anatole had very soon abandoned his<br>wife and, for a payment which he agreed to send to his father-in-law,<br>had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor.<br><br>Anatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with<br>others. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was<br>impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had<br>never in his life done anything base. He was incapable of considering<br>how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or<br>that action of his might be. He was convinced that, as a duck is so made<br>that it must live in water, so God had made him such that he must spend<br>thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in<br>society. He believed this so firmly that others, looking at him, were<br>persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place<br>in society or money, which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and<br>evidently would not repay.<br><br>He was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning. He was<br>not vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still less could<br>he be accused of ambition. More than once he had vexed his father by<br>spoiling his own career, and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds. He<br>was not mean, and did not refuse anyone who asked of him. All he cared<br>about was gaiety and women, and as according to his ideas there<br>was nothing dishonorable in these tastes, and he was incapable of<br>considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others,<br>he honestly considered himself irreproachable, sincerely despised rogues<br>and bad people, and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high.<br><br>Rakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence<br>similar to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of<br>forgiveness. “All will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and all<br>will be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much.”<br><br>Dólokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and<br>his Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling, and<br>dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kurágin and<br>made use of him for his own ends.<br><br>Anatole was sincerely fond of Dólokhov for his cleverness and<br>audacity. Dólokhov, who needed Anatole Kurágin’s name, position, and<br>connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set, made<br>use of him and amused himself at his expense without letting the other<br>feel it. Apart from the advantage he derived from Anatole, the very<br>process of dominating another’s will was in itself a pleasure, a<br>habit, and a necessity to Dólokhov.<br><br>Natásha had made a strong impression on Kurágin. At supper after<br>the opera he described to Dólokhov with the air of a connoisseur the<br>attractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and expressed his<br>intention of making love to her. Anatole had no notion and was incapable<br>of considering what might come of such love-making, as he never had any<br>notion of the outcome of any of his actions.<br><br>“She’s first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us,” replied<br>Dólokhov.<br><br>“I will tell my sister to ask her to dinner,” said Anatole.<br>“Eh?”<br><br>“You’d better wait till she’s married....”<br><br>“You know, I adore little girls, they lose their heads at once,”<br>pursued Anatole.<br><br>“You have been caught once already by a ‘little girl,’” said<br>Dólokhov who knew of Kurágin’s marriage. “Take care!”<br><br>“Well, that can’t happen twice! Eh?” said Anatole, with a<br>good-humored laugh.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>The day after the opera the Rostóvs went nowhere and nobody came to see<br>them. Márya Dmítrievna talked to the count about something which they<br>concealed from Natásha. Natásha guessed they were talking about the<br>old prince and planning something, and this disquieted and offended her.<br>She was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice that day sent a<br>manservant to the Vozdvízhenka to ascertain whether he had come. He had<br>not arrived. She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow.<br>To her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant<br>recollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince,<br>and a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause. She<br>continually fancied that either he would never come or that something<br>would happen to her before he came. She could no longer think of him by<br>herself calmly and continuously as she had done before. As soon as she<br>began to think of him, the recollection of the old prince, of Princess<br>Mary, of the theater, and of Kurágin mingled with her thoughts. The<br>question again presented itself whether she was not guilty, whether she<br>had not already broken faith with Prince Andrew, and again she found<br>herself recalling to the minutest detail every word, every gesture, and<br>every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had<br>been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying<br>feeling. To the family Natásha seemed livelier than usual, but she was<br>far less tranquil and happy than before.<br><br>On Sunday morning Márya Dmítrievna invited her visitors to Mass at her<br>parish church—the Church of the Assumption built over the graves of<br>victims of the plague.<br><br>“I don’t like those fashionable churches,” she said, evidently<br>priding herself on her independence of thought. “God is the same<br>everywhere. We have an excellent priest, he conducts the service<br>decently and with dignity, and the deacon is the same. What holiness is<br>there in giving concerts in the choir? I don’t like it, it’s just<br>self-indulgence!”<br><br>Márya Dmítrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them. Her whole<br>house was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither she nor the<br>servants worked, and they all wore holiday dress and went to church. At<br>her table there were extra dishes at dinner, and the servants had vodka<br>and roast goose or suckling pig. But in nothing in the house was the<br>holiday so noticeable as in Márya Dmítrievna’s broad, stern face,<br>which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity.<br><br>After Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining room<br>where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture, a servant<br>announced that the carriage was ready, and Márya Dmítrievna rose with<br>a stern air. She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid calls, and<br>announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas Bolkónski to have<br>an explanation with him about Natásha.<br><br>After she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited on<br>the Rostóvs, and Natásha, very glad of this diversion, having shut<br>herself into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself trying<br>on the new dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and<br>only tacked together, and was turning her head to see in the glass how<br>the back fitted, she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds<br>of her father’s voice and another’s—a woman’s—that made her<br>flush. It was Hélène. Natásha had not time to take off the bodice<br>before the door opened and Countess Bezúkhova, dressed in a purple<br>velvet gown with a high collar, came into the room beaming with<br>good-humored amiable smiles.<br><br>“Oh, my enchantress!” she cried to the blushing Natásha.<br>“Charming! No, this is really beyond anything, my dear count,” said<br>she to Count Rostóv who had followed her in. “How can you live in<br>Moscow and go nowhere? No, I won’t let you off! Mademoiselle George<br>will recite at my house tonight and there’ll be some people, and if<br>you don’t bring your lovely girls—who are prettier than Mademoiselle<br>George—I won’t know you! My husband is away in Tver or I would send<br>him to fetch you. You must come. You positively must! Between eight and<br>nine.”<br><br>She nodded to the dressmaker, whom she knew and who had curtsied<br>respectfully to her, and seated herself in an armchair beside the<br>looking glass, draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely. She<br>did not cease chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually praising<br>Natásha’s beauty. She looked at Natásha’s dresses and praised<br>them, as well as a new dress of her own made of “metallic gauze,”<br>which she had received from Paris, and advised Natásha to have one like<br>it.<br><br>“But anything suits you, my charmer!” she remarked.<br><br>A smile of pleasure never left Natásha’s face. She felt happy and as<br>if she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess Bezúkhova<br>who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was<br>now so kind to her. Natásha brightened up and felt almost in love with<br>this woman, who was so beautiful and so kind. Hélène for her part was<br>sincerely delighted with Natásha and wished to give her a good time.<br>Anatole had asked her to bring him and Natásha together, and she was<br>calling on the Rostóvs for that purpose. The idea of throwing her<br>brother and Natásha together amused her.<br><br>Though at one time, in Petersburg, she had been annoyed with Natásha<br>for drawing Borís away, she did not think of that now, and in her own<br>way heartily wished Natásha well. As she was leaving the Rostóvs she<br>called her protégée aside.<br><br>“My brother dined with me yesterday—we nearly died of laughter—he<br>ate nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite<br>madly, in love with you, my dear.”<br><br>Natásha blushed scarlet when she heard this.<br><br>“How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!” said Hélène. “You<br>must certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a<br>reason to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your<br>fiancé would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to<br>death.”<br><br>“So she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierre—that good<br>Pierre—have talked and laughed about this. So it’s all right.” And<br>again, under Hélène’s influence, what had seemed terrible now seemed<br>simple and natural. “And she is such a grande dame, so kind, and<br>evidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself?” thought<br>Natásha, gazing at Hélène with wide-open, wondering eyes.<br><br>Márya Dmítrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious, having<br>evidently suffered a defeat at the old prince’s. She was still too<br>agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly. In<br>answer to the count’s inquiries she replied that things were all<br>right and that she would tell about it next day. On hearing of Countess<br>Bezúkhova’s visit and the invitation for that evening, Márya<br>Dmítrievna remarked:<br><br>“I don’t care to have anything to do with Bezúkhova and don’t<br>advise you to; however, if you’ve promised—go. It will divert your<br>thoughts,” she added, addressing Natásha.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>Count Rostóv took the girls to Countess Bezúkhova’s. There were<br>a good many people there, but nearly all strangers to Natásha. Count<br>Rostóv was displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely<br>of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct. Mademoiselle<br>George was standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young<br>men. There were several Frenchmen present, among them Métivier who from<br>the time Hélène reached Moscow had been an intimate in her house. The<br>count decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight<br>and to get away as soon as Mademoiselle George’s performance was over.<br><br>Anatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the Rostóvs.<br>Immediately after greeting the count he went up to Natásha and followed<br>her. As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had<br>had at the opera—gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at<br>the absence of a moral barrier between them.<br><br>Hélène welcomed Natásha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her<br>beauty and her dress. Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George went<br>out of the room to change her costume. In the drawing room people began<br>arranging the chairs and taking their seats. Anatole moved a chair for<br>Natásha and was about to sit down beside her, but the count, who never<br>lost sight of her, took the seat himself. Anatole sat down behind her.<br><br>Mademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and a red shawl<br>draped over one shoulder, came into the space left vacant for her, and<br>assumed an unnatural pose. Enthusiastic whispering was audible.<br><br>Mademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and<br>began reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for her<br>son. In some places she raised her voice, in others she whispered,<br>lifting her head triumphantly; sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse<br>sounds, rolling her eyes.<br><br>“Adorable! divine! delicious!” was heard from every side.<br><br>Natásha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor heard nor<br>understood anything of what went on before her. She only felt herself<br>again completely borne away into this strange senseless world—so<br>remote from her old world—a world in which it was impossible to know<br>what was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. Behind her sat Anatole,<br>and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of<br>expectancy.<br><br>After the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded<br>Mademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.<br><br>“How beautiful she is!” Natásha remarked to her father who had also<br>risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress.<br><br>“I don’t think so when I look at you!” said Anatole, following<br>Natásha. He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him. “You<br>are enchanting... from the moment I saw you I have never ceased...”<br><br>“Come, come, Natásha!” said the count, as he turned back for his<br>daughter. “How beautiful she is!” Natásha without saying anything<br>stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring<br>eyes.<br><br>After giving several recitations, Mademoiselle George left, and Countess<br>Bezúkhova asked her visitors into the ballroom.<br><br>The count wished to go home, but Hélène entreated him not to spoil her<br>improvised ball, and the Rostóvs stayed on. Anatole asked Natásha for<br>a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her<br>she was bewitching and that he loved her. During the écossaise, which<br>she also danced with him, Anatole said nothing when they happened to be<br>by themselves, but merely gazed at her. Natásha lifted her frightened<br>eyes to him, but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate<br>look and smile that she could not, whilst looking at him, say what she<br>had to say. She lowered her eyes.<br><br>“Don’t say such things to me. I am betrothed and love another,”<br>she said rapidly.... She glanced at him.<br><br>Anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said.<br><br>“Don’t speak to me of that! What can I do?” said he. “I tell<br>you I am madly, madly, in love with you! Is it my fault that you are<br>enchanting?... It’s our turn to begin.”<br><br>Natásha, animated and excited, looked about her with wide-open<br>frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual. She understood hardly<br>anything that went on that evening. They danced the écossaise and the<br>Grossvater. Her father asked her to come home, but she begged to remain.<br>Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to, she felt his eyes<br>upon her. Later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let<br>her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress, that Hélène had<br>followed her and spoken laughingly of her brother’s love, and that she<br>again met Anatole in the little sitting room. Hélène had disappeared<br>leaving them alone, and Anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender<br>voice:<br><br>“I cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never see<br>you? I love you madly. Can I never...?” and, blocking her path, he<br>brought his face close to hers.<br><br>His large, glittering, masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw<br>nothing but them.<br><br>“Natalie?” he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being<br>painfully pressed. “Natalie?”<br><br>“I don’t understand. I have nothing to say,” her eyes replied.<br><br>Burning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant she felt<br>herself released, and Hélène’s footsteps and the rustle of her dress<br>were heard in the room. Natásha looked round at her, and then, red<br>and trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved<br>toward the door.<br><br>“One word, just one, for God’s sake!” cried Anatole.<br><br>She paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what<br>had happened and to which she could find no answer.<br><br>“Natalie, just a word, only one!” he kept repeating, evidently not<br>knowing what to say and he repeated it till Hélène came up to them.<br><br>Hélène returned with Natásha to the drawing room. The Rostóvs went<br>away without staying for supper.<br><br>After reaching home Natásha did not sleep all night. She was tormented<br>by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or Prince Andrew.<br>She loved Prince Andrew—she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved<br>him. But she also loved Anatole, of that there was no doubt. “Else how<br>could all this have happened?” thought she. “If, after that, I could<br>return his smile when saying good-by, if I was able to let it come to<br>that, it means that I loved him from the first. It means that he is<br>kind, noble, and splendid, and I could not help loving him. What am I to<br>do if I love him and the other one too?” she asked herself, unable to<br>find an answer to these terrible questions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>Morning came with its cares and bustle. Everyone got up and began<br>to move about and talk, dressmakers came again. Márya Dmítrievna<br>appeared, and they were called to breakfast. Natásha kept looking<br>uneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intercept<br>every glance directed toward her, and tried to appear the same as usual.<br><br>After breakfast, which was her best time, Márya Dmítrievna sat down in<br>her armchair and called Natásha and the count to her.<br><br>“Well, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over and this is<br>my advice,” she began. “Yesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince<br>Bolkónski. Well, I had a talk with him.... He took it into his head to<br>begin shouting, but I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had<br>to say!”<br><br>“Well, and he?” asked the count.<br><br>“He? He’s crazy... he did not want to listen. But what’s the use<br>of talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out,” said Márya<br>Dmítrievna. “My advice to you is finish your business and go back<br>home to Otrádnoe... and wait there.”<br><br>“Oh, no!” exclaimed Natásha.<br><br>“Yes, go back,” said Márya Dmítrievna, “and wait there. If your<br>betrothed comes here now—there will be no avoiding a quarrel; but<br>alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to<br>you.”<br><br>Count Rostóv approved of this suggestion, appreciating its<br>reasonableness. If the old man came round it would be all the better to<br>visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the wedding,<br>against his wishes, could only be arranged at Otrádnoe.<br><br>“That is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see him and took<br>her,” said the old count.<br><br>“No, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. But if he<br>won’t—that’s his affair,” said Márya Dmítrievna, looking for<br>something in her reticule. “Besides, the trousseau is ready, so there<br>is nothing to wait for; and what is not ready I’ll send after you.<br>Though I don’t like letting you go, it is the best way. So go, with<br>God’s blessing!”<br><br>Having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to<br>Natásha. It was a letter from Princess Mary.<br><br>“She has written to you. How she torments herself, poor thing! She’s<br>afraid you might think that she does not like you.”<br><br>“But she doesn’t like me,” said Natásha.<br><br>“Don’t talk nonsense!” cried Márya Dmítrievna.<br><br>“I shan’t believe anyone, I know she doesn’t like me,” replied<br>Natásha boldly as she took the letter, and her face expressed a cold<br>and angry resolution that caused Márya Dmítrievna to look at her more<br>intently and to frown.<br><br>“Don’t answer like that, my good girl!” she said. “What I say is<br>true! Write an answer!”<br><br>Natásha did not reply and went to her own room to read Princess<br>Mary’s letter.<br><br>Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that<br>had occurred between them. Whatever her father’s feelings might be,<br>she begged Natásha to believe that she could not help loving her as<br>the one chosen by her brother, for whose happiness she was ready to<br>sacrifice everything.<br><br>“Do not think, however,” she wrote, “that my father is<br>ill-disposed toward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be<br>forgiven; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his<br>son happy.” Princess Mary went on to ask Natásha to fix a time when<br>she could see her again.<br><br>After reading the letter Natásha sat down at the writing table<br>to answer it. “Dear Princess,” she wrote in French quickly and<br>mechanically, and then paused. What more could she write after all that<br>had happened the evening before? “Yes, yes! All that has happened, and<br>now all is changed,” she thought as she sat with the letter she had<br>begun before her. “Must I break off with him? Must I really? That’s<br>awful...” and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to<br>Sónya and began sorting patterns with her.<br><br>After dinner Natásha went to her room and again took up Princess<br>Mary’s letter. “Can it be that it is all over?” she thought.<br>“Can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all<br>that went before?” She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its<br>former strength, and at the same time felt that she loved Kurágin. She<br>vividly pictured herself as Prince Andrew’s wife, and the scenes of<br>happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination, and<br>at the same time, aglow with excitement, recalled every detail of<br>yesterday’s interview with Anatole.<br><br>“Why could that not be as well?” she sometimes asked herself in<br>complete bewilderment. “Only so could I be completely happy; but now I<br>have to choose, and I can’t be happy without either of them. Only,”<br>she thought, “to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide<br>it from him are both equally impossible. But with that one nothing is<br>spoiled. But am I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew’s<br>love, in which I have lived so long?”<br><br>“Please, Miss!” whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious<br>air. “A man told me to give you this—” and she handed Natásha a<br>letter.<br><br>“Only, for Christ’s sake...” the girl went on, as Natásha,<br>without thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter<br>from Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only<br>that it was a letter from him—from the man she loved. Yes, she loved<br>him, or else how could that have happened which had happened? And how<br>could she have a love letter from him in her hand?<br><br>With trembling hands Natásha held that passionate love letter which<br>Dólokhov had composed for Anatole, and as she read it she found in it<br>an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling.<br><br>“Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you<br>or to die. There is no other way for me,” the letter began. Then he<br>went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him—for<br>this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her—but that if<br>she loved him she need only say the word yes, and no human power could<br>hinder their bliss. Love would conquer all. He would steal her away and<br>carry her off to the ends of the earth.<br><br>“Yes, yes! I love him!” thought Natásha, reading the letter for the<br>twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of<br>it.<br><br>That evening Márya Dmítrievna was going to the Akhárovs’ and<br>proposed to take the girls with her. Natásha, pleading a headache,<br>remained at home.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>On returning late in the evening Sónya went to Natásha’s room, and<br>to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa. Open on<br>the table, beside her lay Anatole’s letter. Sónya picked it up and<br>read it.<br><br>As she read she glanced at the sleeping Natásha, trying to find in her<br>face an explanation of what she was reading, but did not find it. Her<br>face was calm, gentle, and happy. Clutching her breast to keep herself<br>from choking, Sónya, pale and trembling with fear and agitation, sat<br>down in an armchair and burst into tears.<br><br>“How was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far? Can she have<br>left off loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let Kurágin go to<br>such lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, that’s plain! What will<br>Nicholas, dear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is<br>the meaning of her excited, resolute, unnatural look the day before<br>yesterday, yesterday, and today,” thought Sónya. “But it can’t be<br>that she loves him! She probably opened the letter without knowing who<br>it was from. Probably she is offended by it. She could not do such a<br>thing!”<br><br>Sónya wiped away her tears and went up to Natásha, again scanning her<br>face.<br><br>“Natásha!” she said, just audibly.<br><br>Natásha awoke and saw Sónya.<br><br>“Ah, you’re back?”<br><br>And with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of<br>awakening, she embraced her friend, but noticing Sónya’s look of<br>embarrassment, her own face expressed confusion and suspicion.<br><br>“Sónya, you’ve read that letter?” she demanded.<br><br>“Yes,” answered Sónya softly.<br><br>Natásha smiled rapturously.<br><br>“No, Sónya, I can’t any longer!” she said. “I can’t hide it<br>from you any longer. You know, we love one another! Sónya, darling, he<br>writes... Sónya...”<br><br>Sónya stared open-eyed at Natásha, unable to believe her ears.<br><br>“And Bolkónski?” she asked.<br><br>“Ah, Sónya, if you only knew how happy I am!” cried Natásha.<br>“You don’t know what love is....”<br><br>“But, Natásha, can that be all over?”<br><br>Natásha looked at Sónya with wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp<br>the question.<br><br>“Well, then, are you refusing Prince Andrew?” said Sónya.<br><br>“Oh, you don’t understand anything! Don’t talk nonsense, just<br>listen!” said Natásha, with momentary vexation.<br><br>“But I can’t believe it,” insisted Sónya. “I don’t<br>understand. How is it you have loved a man for a whole year and<br>suddenly... Why, you have only seen him three times! Natásha, I don’t<br>believe you, you’re joking! In three days to forget everything and<br>so...”<br><br>“Three days?” said Natásha. “It seems to me I’ve loved him a<br>hundred years. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You<br>can’t understand it.... Sónya, wait a bit, sit here,” and Natásha<br>embraced and kissed her.<br><br>“I had heard that it happens like this, and you must have heard it<br>too, but it’s only now that I feel such love. It’s not the same as<br>before. As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave,<br>and that I could not help loving him. Yes, his slave! Whatever he orders<br>I shall do. You don’t understand that. What can I do? What can I do,<br>Sónya?” cried Natásha with a happy yet frightened expression.<br><br>“But think what you are doing,” cried Sónya. “I can’t leave<br>it like this. This secret correspondence... How could you let him go so<br>far?” she went on, with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal.<br><br>“I told you that I have no will,” Natásha replied. “Why can’t<br>you understand? I love him!”<br><br>“Then I won’t let it come to that... I shall tell!” cried Sónya,<br>bursting into tears.<br><br>“What do you mean? For God’s sake... If you tell, you are my<br>enemy!” declared Natásha. “You want me to be miserable, you want us<br>to be separated....”<br><br>When she saw Natásha’s fright, Sónya shed tears of shame and pity<br>for her friend.<br><br>“But what has happened between you?” she asked. “What has he said<br>to you? Why doesn’t he come to the house?”<br><br>Natásha did not answer her questions.<br><br>“For God’s sake, Sónya, don’t tell anyone, don’t torture<br>me,” Natásha entreated. “Remember no one ought to interfere in such<br>matters! I have confided in you....”<br><br>“But why this secrecy? Why doesn’t he come to the house?” asked<br>Sónya. “Why doesn’t he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince<br>Andrew gave you complete freedom—if it is really so; but I don’t<br>believe it! Natásha, have you considered what these secret reasons can<br>be?”<br><br>Natásha looked at Sónya with astonishment. Evidently this question<br>presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how<br>to answer it.<br><br>“I don’t know what the reasons are. But there must be reasons!”<br><br>Sónya sighed and shook her head incredulously.<br><br>“If there were reasons...” she began.<br><br>But Natásha, guessing her doubts, interrupted her in alarm.<br><br>“Sónya, one can’t doubt him! One can’t, one can’t! Don’t you<br>understand?” she cried.<br><br>“Does he love you?”<br><br>“Does he love me?” Natásha repeated with a smile of pity at her<br>friend’s lack of comprehension. “Why, you have read his letter and<br>you have seen him.”<br><br>“But if he is dishonorable?”<br><br>“He! dishonorable? If you only knew!” exclaimed Natásha.<br><br>“If he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or<br>cease seeing you; and if you won’t do this, I will. I will write to<br>him, and I will tell Papa!” said Sónya resolutely.<br><br>“But I can’t live without him!” cried Natásha.<br><br>“Natásha, I don’t understand you. And what are you saying! Think of<br>your father and of Nicholas.”<br><br>“I don’t want anyone, I don’t love anyone but him. How dare you<br>say he is dishonorable? Don’t you know that I love him?” screamed<br>Natásha. “Go away, Sónya! I don’t want to quarrel with you, but<br>go, for God’s sake go! You see how I am suffering!” Natásha cried<br>angrily, in a voice of despair and repressed irritation. Sónya burst<br>into sobs and ran from the room.<br><br>Natásha went to the table and without a moment’s reflection wrote<br>that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all<br>the morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their<br>misunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the<br>magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her<br>freedom, she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her<br>if she had been to blame toward her, but that she could not be his<br>wife. At that moment this all seemed quite easy, simple, and clear to<br>Natásha.<br><br><br>On Friday the Rostóvs were to return to the country, but on Wednesday<br>the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow.<br><br>On the day the count left, Sónya and Natásha were invited to a big<br>dinner party at the Karágins’, and Márya Dmítrievna took them<br>there. At that party Natásha again met Anatole, and Sónya noticed<br>that she spoke to him, trying not to be overheard, and that all through<br>dinner she was more agitated than ever. When they got home Natásha was<br>the first to begin the explanation Sónya expected.<br><br>“There, Sónya, you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him,”<br>Natásha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be<br>praised. “We have had an explanation today.”<br><br>“Well, what happened? What did he say? Natásha, how glad I am<br>you’re not angry with me! Tell me everything—the whole truth. What<br>did he say?”<br><br>Natásha became thoughtful.<br><br>“Oh, Sónya, if you knew him as I do! He said... He asked me what I<br>had promised Bolkónski. He was glad I was free to refuse him.”<br><br>Sónya sighed sorrowfully.<br><br>“But you haven’t refused Bolkónski?” said she.<br><br>“Perhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkónski. Why do<br>you think so badly of me?”<br><br>“I don’t think anything, only I don’t understand this...”<br><br>“Wait a bit, Sónya, you’ll understand everything. You’ll see what<br>a man he is! Now don’t think badly of me or of him. I don’t think<br>badly of anyone: I love and pity everybody. But what am I to do?”<br><br>Sónya did not succumb to the tender tone Natásha used toward her.<br>The more emotional and ingratiating the expression of Natásha’s face<br>became, the more serious and stern grew Sónya’s.<br><br>“Natásha,” said she, “you asked me not to speak to you, and I<br>haven’t spoken, but now you yourself have begun. I don’t trust him,<br>Natásha. Why this secrecy?”<br><br>“Again, again!” interrupted Natásha.<br><br>“Natásha, I am afraid for you!”<br><br>“Afraid of what?”<br><br>“I am afraid you’re going to your ruin,” said Sónya resolutely,<br>and was herself horrified at what she had said.<br><br>Anger again showed in Natásha’s face.<br><br>“And I’ll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possible! It’s not<br>your business! It won’t be you, but I, who’ll suffer. Leave me<br>alone, leave me alone! I hate you!”<br><br>“Natásha!” moaned Sónya, aghast.<br><br>“I hate you, I hate you! You’re my enemy forever!” And Natásha<br>ran out of the room.<br><br>Natásha did not speak to Sónya again and avoided her. With the same<br>expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house,<br>taking up now one occupation, now another, and at once abandoning them.<br><br>Hard as it was for Sónya, she watched her friend and did not let her<br>out of her sight.<br><br>The day before the count was to return, Sónya noticed that Natásha sat<br>by the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and<br>that she made a sign to an officer who drove past, whom Sónya took to<br>be Anatole.<br><br>Sónya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that<br>at dinner and all that evening Natásha was in a strange and unnatural<br>state. She answered questions at random, began sentences she did not<br>finish, and laughed at everything.<br><br>After tea Sónya noticed a housemaid at Natásha’s door timidly<br>waiting to let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at<br>the door learned that another letter had been delivered.<br><br>Then suddenly it became clear to Sónya that Natásha had some dreadful<br>plan for that evening. Sónya knocked at her door. Natásha did not let<br>her in.<br><br>“She will run away with him!” thought Sónya. “She is capable of<br>anything. There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in<br>her face today. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle,” Sónya<br>remembered. “Yes, that’s it, she means to elope with him, but<br>what am I to do?” thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly<br>indicated that Natásha had some terrible intention. “The count is<br>away. What am I to do? Write to Kurágin demanding an explanation? But<br>what is there to oblige him to reply? Write to Pierre, as Prince Andrew<br>asked me to in case of some misfortune?... But perhaps she really<br>has already refused Bolkónski—she sent a letter to Princess Mary<br>yesterday. And Uncle is away....” To tell Márya Dmítrievna who had<br>such faith in Natásha seemed to Sónya terrible. “Well, anyway,”<br>thought Sónya as she stood in the dark passage, “now or never I must<br>prove that I remember the family’s goodness to me and that I love<br>Nicholas. Yes! If I don’t sleep for three nights I’ll not leave this<br>passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family<br>be disgraced,” thought she.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>Anatole had lately moved to Dólokhov’s. The plan for Natalie<br>Rostóva’s abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by<br>Dólokhov a few days before, and on the day that Sónya, after listening<br>at Natásha’s door, resolved to safeguard her, it was to have been<br>put into execution. Natásha had promised to come out to Kurágin at the<br>back porch at ten that evening. Kurágin was to put her into a troyka<br>he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of<br>Kámenka, where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a<br>marriage ceremony over them. At Kámenka a relay of horses was to wait<br>which would take them to the Warsaw highroad, and from there they would<br>hasten abroad with post horses.<br><br>Anatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand rubles<br>he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with<br>Dólokhov’s help.<br><br>Two witnesses for the mock marriage—Khvóstikov, a retired petty<br>official whom Dólokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and<br>Makárin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an unbounded<br>affection for Kurágin—were sitting at tea in Dólokhov’s front<br>room.<br><br>In his large study, the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with<br>Persian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat Dólokhov in a traveling cloak<br>and high boots, at an open desk on which lay an abacus and some bundles<br>of paper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to and fro from<br>the room where the witnesses were sitting, through the study to the room<br>behind, where his French valet and others were packing the last of his<br>things. Dólokhov was counting the money and noting something down.<br><br>“Well,” he said, “Khvóstikov must have two thousand.”<br><br>“Give it to him, then,” said Anatole.<br><br>“Makárka” (their name for Makárin) “will go through fire and<br>water for you for nothing. So here are our accounts all settled,” said<br>Dólokhov, showing him the memorandum. “Is that right?”<br><br>“Yes, of course,” returned Anatole, evidently not listening to<br>Dólokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not<br>leave his face.<br><br>Dólokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an<br>ironic smile:<br><br>“Do you know? You’d really better drop it all. There’s still<br>time!”<br><br>“Fool,” retorted Anatole. “Don’t talk nonsense! If you only<br>knew... it’s the devil knows what!”<br><br>“No, really, give it up!” said Dólokhov. “I am speaking<br>seriously. It’s no joke, this plot you’ve hatched.”<br><br>“What, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?” said Anatole, making a<br>grimace. “Really it’s no time for your stupid jokes,” and he left<br>the room.<br><br>Dólokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had<br>gone out.<br><br>“You wait a bit,” he called after him. “I’m not joking, I’m<br>talking sense. Come here, come here!”<br><br>Anatole returned and looked at Dólokhov, trying to give him his<br>attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily.<br><br>“Now listen to me. I’m telling you this for the last time. Why<br>should I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything for<br>you? Who found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the money? I<br>did it all.”<br><br>“Well, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?” And<br>Anatole sighed and embraced Dólokhov.<br><br>“I helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a<br>dangerous business, and if you think about it—a stupid business. Well,<br>you’ll carry her off—all right! Will they let it stop at that? It<br>will come out that you’re already married. Why, they’ll have you in<br>the criminal court....”<br><br>“Oh, nonsense, nonsense!” Anatole ejaculated and again made a<br>grimace. “Didn’t I explain to you? What?” And Anatole, with the<br>partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached<br>by their own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already put to<br>Dólokhov a hundred times. “Didn’t I explain to you that I have come<br>to this conclusion: if this marriage is invalid,” he went on, crooking<br>one finger, “then I have nothing to answer for; but if it is valid, no<br>matter! Abroad no one will know anything about it. Isn’t that so? And<br>don’t talk to me, don’t, don’t.”<br><br>“Seriously, you’d better drop it! You’ll only get yourself into a<br>mess!”<br><br>“Go to the devil!” cried Anatole and, clutching his hair, left the<br>room, but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of<br>Dólokhov with his feet turned under him. “It’s the very devil!<br>What? Feel how it beats!” He took Dólokhov’s hand and put it on his<br>heart. “What a foot, my dear fellow! What a glance! A goddess!” he<br>added in French. “What?”<br><br>Dólokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes<br>looked at him—evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him.<br><br>“Well and when the money’s gone, what then?”<br><br>“What then? Eh?” repeated Anatole, sincerely perplexed by a thought<br>of the future. “What then?... Then, I don’t know.... But why talk<br>nonsense!” He glanced at his watch. “It’s time!”<br><br>Anatole went into the back room.<br><br>“Now then! Nearly ready? You’re dawdling!” he shouted to the<br>servants.<br><br>Dólokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to bring<br>something for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went into<br>the room where Khvóstikov and Makárin were sitting.<br><br>Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling<br>pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself.<br><br>“Come and eat something. Have a drink!” Dólokhov shouted to him<br>from the other room.<br><br>“I don’t want to,” answered Anatole continuing to smile.<br><br>“Come! Balagá is here.”<br><br>Anatole rose and went into the dining room. Balagá was a famous troyka<br>driver who had known Dólokhov and Anatole some six years and had given<br>them good service with his troykas. More than once when Anatole’s<br>regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the<br>evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back again<br>the next night. More than once he had enabled Dólokhov to escape when<br>pursued. More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies<br>and “ladykins” as he called the cocottes. More than once in their<br>service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets<br>of Moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by “my<br>gentlemen” as he called them. He had ruined more than one horse in<br>their service. More than once they had beaten him, and more than once<br>they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira, which he loved; and<br>he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have<br>sent an ordinary man to Siberia. They often called Balagá into their<br>orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies’, and more than one<br>thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands. In their<br>service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year, and in<br>their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would<br>buy. But he liked them; liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour,<br>liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian, and flying at<br>full gallop through the Moscow streets. He liked to hear those wild,<br>tipsy shouts behind him: “Get on! Get on!” when it was impossible<br>to go any faster. He liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some<br>peasant who, more dead than alive, was already hurrying out of his way.<br>“Real gentlemen!” he considered them.<br><br>Anatole and Dólokhov liked Balagá too for his masterly driving and<br>because he liked the things they liked. With others Balagá bargained,<br>charging twenty-five rubles for a two hours’ drive, and rarely<br>drove himself, generally letting his young men do so. But with “his<br>gentlemen” he always drove himself and never demanded anything for<br>his work. Only a couple of times a year—when he knew from their valets<br>that they had money in hand—he would turn up of a morning quite sober<br>and with a deep bow would ask them to help him. The gentlemen always<br>made him sit down.<br><br>“Do help me out, Theodore Iványch, sir,” or “your excellency,”<br>he would say. “I am quite out of horses. Let me have what you can to<br>go to the fair.”<br><br>And Anatole and Dólokhov, when they had money, would give him a<br>thousand or a couple of thousand rubles.<br><br>Balagá was a fair-haired, short, and snub-nosed peasant of about<br>twenty-seven; red-faced, with a particularly red thick neck, glittering<br>little eyes, and a small beard. He wore a fine, dark-blue, silk-lined<br>cloth coat over a sheepskin.<br><br>On entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward the front<br>corner of the room, and went up to Dólokhov, holding out a small, black<br>hand.<br><br>“Theodore Iványch!” he said, bowing.<br><br>“How d’you do, friend? Well, here he is!”<br><br>“Good day, your excellency!” he said, again holding out his hand to<br>Anatole who had just come in.<br><br>“I say, Balagá,” said Anatole, putting his hands on the man’s<br>shoulders, “do you care for me or not? Eh? Now, do me a service....<br>What horses have you come with? Eh?”<br><br>“As your messenger ordered, your special beasts,” replied Balagá.<br><br>“Well, listen, Balagá! Drive all three to death but get me there in<br>three hours. Eh?”<br><br>“When they are dead, what shall I drive?” said Balagá with a wink.<br><br>“Mind, I’ll smash your face in! Don’t make jokes!” cried<br>Anatole, suddenly rolling his eyes.<br><br>“Why joke?” said the driver, laughing. “As if I’d grudge my<br>gentlemen anything! As fast as ever the horses can gallop, so fast<br>we’ll go!”<br><br>“Ah!” said Anatole. “Well, sit down.”<br><br>“Yes, sit down!” said Dólokhov.<br><br>“I’ll stand, Theodore Iványch.”<br><br>“Sit down; nonsense! Have a drink!” said Anatole, and filled a large<br>glass of Madeira for him.<br><br>The driver’s eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After refusing<br>it for manners’ sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk<br>handkerchief he took out of his cap.<br><br>“And when are we to start, your excellency?”<br><br>“Well...” Anatole looked at his watch. “We’ll start at once.<br>Mind, Balagá! You’ll get there in time? Eh?”<br><br>“That depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldn’t we be<br>there in time?” replied Balagá. “Didn’t we get you to Tver in<br>seven hours? I think you remember that, your excellency?”<br><br>“Do you know, one Christmas I drove from Tver,” said Anatole,<br>smilingly at the recollection and turning to Makárin who gazed<br>rapturously at him with wide-open eyes. “Will you believe it,<br>Makárka, it took one’s breath away, the rate we flew. We came across<br>a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them. Eh?”<br><br>“Those were horses!” Balagá continued the tale. “That time I’d<br>harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts,” he went<br>on, turning to Dólokhov. “Will you believe it, Theodore Iványch,<br>those animals flew forty miles? I couldn’t hold them in, my hands grew<br>numb in the sharp frost so that I threw down the reins—‘Catch hold<br>yourself, your excellency!’ says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom<br>of the sleigh and sprawled there. It wasn’t a case of urging them on,<br>there was no holding them in till we reached the place. The devils took<br>us there in three hours! Only the near one died of it.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVII<br><br>Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing<br>a fur coat girt with a silver belt, and a sable cap jauntily set on one<br>side and very becoming to his handsome face. Having looked in a mirror,<br>and standing before Dólokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it,<br>he lifted a glass of wine.<br><br>“Well, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for everything and farewell!” said<br>Anatole. “Well, comrades and friends...” he considered for a moment “...<br>of my youth, farewell!” he said, turning to Makárin and the others.<br><br>Though they were all going with him, Anatole evidently wished to make<br>something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades. He<br>spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed<br>one leg.<br><br>“All take glasses; you too, Balagá. Well, comrades and friends of my<br>youth, we’ve had our fling and lived and reveled. Eh? And now, when<br>shall we meet again? I am going abroad. We have had a good time—now<br>farewell, lads! To our health! Hurrah!...” he cried, and emptying his<br>glass flung it on the floor.<br><br>“To your health!” said Balagá who also emptied his glass, and wiped his<br>mouth with his handkerchief.<br><br>Makárin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes.<br><br>“Ah, Prince, how sorry I am to part from you!<br><br>“Let’s go. Let’s go!” cried Anatole.<br><br>Balagá was about to leave the room.<br><br>“No, stop!” said Anatole. “Shut the door; we have first to sit down.<br>That’s the way.”<br><br>They shut the door and all sat down.<br><br>“Now, quick march, lads!” said Anatole, rising.<br><br>Joseph, his valet, handed him his sabretache and saber, and they all<br>went out into the vestibule.<br><br>“And where’s the fur cloak?” asked Dólokhov. “Hey, Ignátka! Go to<br>Matrëna Matrévna and ask her for the sable cloak. I have heard what<br>elopements are like,” continued Dólokhov with a wink. “Why, she’ll rush<br>out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing; if you delay<br>at all there’ll be tears and ‘Papa’ and ‘Mamma,’ and she’s frozen in a<br>minute and must go back—but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing<br>and carry her to the sleigh.”<br><br>The valet brought a woman’s fox-lined cloak.<br><br>“Fool, I told you the sable one! Hey, Matrëna, the sable!” he shouted so<br>that his voice rang far through the rooms.<br><br>A handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes<br>and curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a sable<br>mantle on her arm.<br><br>“Here, I don’t grudge it—take it!” she said, evidently afraid of her<br>master and yet regretful of her cloak.<br><br>Dólokhov, without answering, took the cloak, threw it over Matrëna, and<br>wrapped her up in it.<br><br>“That’s the way,” said Dólokhov, “and then so!” and he turned the collar<br>up round her head, leaving only a little of the face uncovered. “And<br>then so, do you see?” and he pushed Anatole’s head forward to meet the<br>gap left by the collar, through which Matrëna’s brilliant smile was<br>seen.<br><br>“Well, good-by, Matrëna,” said Anatole, kissing her. “Ah, my revels here<br>are over. Remember me to Stëshka. There, good-by! Good-by, Matrëna, wish<br>me luck!”<br><br>“Well, Prince, may God give you great luck!” said Matrëna in her gypsy<br>accent.<br><br>Two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were<br>holding the horses. Balagá took his seat in the front one and holding<br>his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately. Anatole and Dólokhov<br>got in with him. Makárin, Khvóstikov, and a valet seated themselves in<br>the other sleigh.<br><br>“Well, are you ready?” asked Balagá.<br><br>“Go!” he cried, twisting the reins round his hands, and the troyka tore<br>down the Nikítski Boulevard.<br><br>“Tproo! Get out of the way! Hi!... Tproo!...” The shouting of Balagá<br>and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could<br>be heard. On the Arbát Square the troyka caught against a carriage;<br>something cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the<br>Arbát Street.<br><br>After taking a turn along the Podnovínski Boulevard, Balagá began to<br>rein in, and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old Konyúsheny<br>Street.<br><br>The young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and Anatole<br>and Dólokhov went along the pavement. When they reached the gate<br>Dólokhov whistled. The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out.<br><br>“Come into the courtyard or you’ll be seen; she’ll come out directly,”<br>said she.<br><br>Dólokhov stayed by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the<br>courtyard, turned the corner, and ran up into the porch.<br><br>He was met by Gabriel, Márya Dmítrievna’s gigantic footman.<br><br>“Come to the mistress, please,” said the footman in his deep bass,<br>intercepting any retreat.<br><br>“To what Mistress? Who are you?” asked Anatole in a breathless whisper.<br><br>“Kindly step in, my orders are to bring you in.”<br><br>“Kurágin! Come back!” shouted Dólokhov. “Betrayed! Back!”<br><br>Dólokhov, after Anatole entered, had remained at the wicket gate and was<br>struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it. With a last<br>desperate effort Dólokhov pushed the porter aside, and when Anatole ran<br>back seized him by the arm, pulled him through the wicket, and ran back<br>with him to the troyka.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>Márya Dmítrievna, having found Sónya weeping in the corridor, made her<br>confess everything, and intercepting the note to Natásha she read it and<br>went into Natásha’s room with it in her hand.<br><br>“You shameless good-for-nothing!” said she. “I won’t hear a word.”<br><br>Pushing back Natásha who looked at her with astonished but tearless<br>eyes, she locked her in; and having given orders to the yard porter to<br>admit the persons who would be coming that evening, but not to let them<br>out again, and having told the footman to bring them up to her, she<br>seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors.<br><br>When Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run<br>away again, she rose frowning, and clasping her hands behind her paced<br>through the rooms a long time considering what she should do. Toward<br>midnight she went to Natásha’s room fingering the key in her pocket.<br>Sónya was sitting sobbing in the corridor. “Márya Dmítrievna, for God’s<br>sake let me in to her!” she pleaded, but Márya Dmítrievna unlocked<br>the door and went in without giving her an answer.... “Disgusting,<br>abominable... In my house... horrid girl, hussy! I’m only sorry for her<br>father!” thought she, trying to restrain her wrath. “Hard as it may<br>be, I’ll tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the<br>count.” She entered the room with resolute steps. Natásha lying on the<br>sofa, her head hidden in her hands, and she did not stir. She was in<br>just the same position in which Márya Dmítrievna had left her.<br><br>“A nice girl! Very nice!” said Márya Dmítrievna. “Arranging meetings<br>with lovers in my house! It’s no use pretending: you listen when I speak<br>to you!” And Márya Dmítrievna touched her arm. “Listen when I speak!<br>You’ve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies. I’d treat you<br>differently, but I’m sorry for your father, so I will conceal it.”<br><br>Natásha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved with<br>noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her. Márya Dmítrievna glanced<br>round at Sónya and seated herself on the sofa beside Natásha.<br><br>“It’s lucky for him that he escaped me; but I’ll find him!” she said in<br>her rough voice. “Do you hear what I am saying or not?” she added.<br><br>She put her large hand under Natásha’s face and turned it toward her.<br>Both Márya Dmítrievna and Sónya were amazed when they saw how Natásha<br>looked. Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed, her<br>cheeks sunken.<br><br>“Let me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!” she muttered,<br>wrenching herself from Márya Dmítrievna’s hands with a vicious effort<br>and sinking down again into her former position.<br><br>“Natalie!” said Márya Dmítrievna. “I wish for your good. Lie still,<br>stay like that then, I won’t touch you. But listen. I won’t tell you how<br>guilty you are. You know that yourself. But when your father comes back<br>tomorrow what am I to tell him? Eh?”<br><br>Again Natásha’s body shook with sobs.<br><br>“Suppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?”<br><br>“I have no betrothed: I have refused him!” cried Natásha.<br><br>“That’s all the same,” continued Márya Dmítrievna. “If they hear of<br>this, will they let it pass? He, your father, I know him... if he<br>challenges him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?”<br><br>“Oh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why? Who asked<br>you to?” shouted Natásha, raising herself on the sofa and looking<br>malignantly at Márya Dmítrievna.<br><br>“But what did you want?” cried Márya Dmítrievna, growing angry again.<br>“Were you kept under lock and key? Who hindered his coming to the house?<br>Why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl?... Well, if he<br>had carried you off... do you think they wouldn’t have found him?<br>Your father, or brother, or your betrothed? And he’s a scoundrel, a<br>wretch—that’s a fact!”<br><br>“He is better than any of you!” exclaimed Natásha getting up. “If you<br>hadn’t interfered... Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it? Sónya,<br>why?... Go away!”<br><br>And she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people<br>bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned. Márya<br>Dmítrievna was to speak again but Natásha cried out:<br><br>“Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!” and she threw herself<br>back on the sofa.<br><br>Márya Dmítrievna went on admonishing her for some time, enjoining on her<br>that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody<br>would know anything about it if only Natásha herself would undertake<br>to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened.<br>Natásha did not reply, nor did she sob any longer, but she grew cold<br>and had a shivering fit. Márya Dmítrievna put a pillow under her head,<br>covered her with two quilts, and herself brought her some lime-flower<br>water, but Natásha did not respond to her.<br><br>“Well, let her sleep,” said Márya Dmítrievna as she went out of the room<br>supposing Natásha to be asleep.<br><br>But Natásha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open eyes she<br>looked straight before her. All that night she did not sleep or weep and<br>did not speak to Sónya who got up and went to her several times.<br><br>Next day Count Rostóv returned from his estate near Moscow in time for<br>lunch as he had promised. He was in very good spirits; the affair with<br>the purchaser was going on satisfactorily, and there was nothing to keep<br>him any longer in Moscow, away from the countess whom he missed. Márya<br>Dmítrievna met him and told him that Natásha had been very unwell the<br>day before and that they had sent for the doctor, but that she was<br>better now. Natásha had not left her room that morning. With compressed<br>and parched lips and dry fixed eyes, she sat at the window, uneasily<br>watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at<br>anyone who entered the room. She was evidently expecting news of him and<br>that he would come or would write to her.<br><br>When the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound<br>of a man’s footstep, and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent<br>expression. She did not even get up to greet him. “What is the matter<br>with you, my angel? Are you ill?” asked the count.<br><br>After a moment’s silence Natásha answered: “Yes, ill.”<br><br>In reply to the count’s anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected<br>and whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she assured him<br>that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry. Márya Dmítrievna<br>confirmed Natásha’s assurances that nothing had happened. From<br>the pretense of illness, from his daughter’s distress, and by the<br>embarrassed faces of Sónya and Márya Dmítrievna, the count saw clearly<br>that something had gone wrong during his absence, but it was so terrible<br>for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved<br>daughter, and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity, that he<br>avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly<br>had happened; and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition<br>delayed their return to the country.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIX<br><br>From the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to go<br>away somewhere, so as not to be near her. Soon after the Rostóvs came<br>to Moscow the effect Natásha had on him made him hasten to carry out<br>his intention. He went to Tver to see Joseph Alexéevich’s widow, who<br>had long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased<br>husband’s.<br><br>When he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from Márya<br>Dmítrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great<br>importance relating to Andrew Bolkónski and his betrothed. Pierre had<br>been avoiding Natásha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her<br>was stronger than a married man’s should be for his friend’s fiancée.<br>Yet some fate constantly threw them together.<br><br>“What can have happened? And what can they want with me?” thought he<br>as he dressed to go to Márya Dmítrievna’s. “If only Prince Andrew would<br>hurry up and come and marry her!” thought he on his way to the house.<br><br>On the Tverskóy Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.<br><br>“Pierre! Been back long?” someone shouted. Pierre raised his head. In<br>a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the<br>dashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion Makárin dashed<br>past. Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military<br>dandies, the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his<br>head slightly bent. His face was fresh and rosy, his white-plumed hat,<br>tilted to one side, disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled<br>with powdery snow.<br><br>“Yes, indeed, that’s a true sage,” thought Pierre. “He sees nothing<br>beyond the pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles him and so he is<br>always cheerful, satisfied, and serene. What wouldn’t I give to be like<br>him!” he thought enviously.<br><br>In Márya Dmítrievna’s anteroom the footman who helped him off with his<br>fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom.<br><br>When he opened the ballroom door Pierre saw Natásha sitting at the<br>window, with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced round at him,<br>frowned, and left the room with an expression of cold dignity.<br><br>“What has happened?” asked Pierre, entering Márya Dmítrievna’s room.<br><br>“Fine doings!” answered Dmítrievna. “For fifty-eight years have I lived<br>in this world and never known anything so disgraceful!”<br><br>And having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him,<br>Márya Dmítrievna informed him that Natásha had refused Prince Andrew<br>without her parents’ knowledge and that the cause of this was Anatole<br>Kurágin into whose society Pierre’s wife had thrown her and with whom<br>Natásha had tried to elope during her father’s absence, in order to be<br>married secretly.<br><br>Pierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to what was told<br>him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince Andrew’s<br>deeply loved affianced wife—the same Natásha Rostóva who used to be so<br>charming—should give up Bolkónski for that fool Anatole who was already<br>secretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in love with him as<br>to agree to run away with him, was something Pierre could not conceive<br>and could not imagine.<br><br>He could not reconcile the charming impression he had of Natásha, whom<br>he had known from a child, with this new conception of her baseness,<br>folly, and cruelty. He thought of his wife. “They are all alike!” he<br>said to himself, reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate<br>enough to be tied to a bad woman. But still he pitied Prince Andrew to<br>the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride, and the more<br>he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with<br>disgust of that Natásha who had just passed him in the ballroom with<br>such a look of cold dignity. He did not know that Natásha’s soul was<br>overflowing with despair, shame, and humiliation, and that it was not<br>her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity<br>and severity.<br><br>“But how get married?” said Pierre, in answer to Márya Dmítrievna. “He<br>could not marry—he is married!”<br><br>“Things get worse from hour to hour!” ejaculated Márya Dmítrievna. “A<br>nice youth! What a scoundrel! And she’s expecting him—expecting him<br>since yesterday. She must be told! Then at least she won’t go on<br>expecting him.”<br><br>After hearing the details of Anatole’s marriage from Pierre, and giving<br>vent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse, Márya Dmítrievna<br>told Pierre why she had sent for him. She was afraid that the count or<br>Bolkónski, who might arrive at any moment, if they knew of this affair<br>(which she hoped to hide from them) might challenge Anatole to a duel,<br>and she therefore asked Pierre to tell his brother-in-law in her name to<br>leave Moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again. Pierre—only<br>now realizing the danger to the old count, Nicholas, and Prince<br>Andrew—promised to do as she wished. Having briefly and exactly<br>explained her wishes to him, she let him go to the drawing room.<br><br>“Mind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing either,”<br>she said. “And I will go and tell her it is no use expecting him! And<br>stay to dinner if you care to!” she called after Pierre.<br><br>Pierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset. That morning<br>Natásha had told him that she had rejected Bolkónski.<br><br>“Troubles, troubles, my dear fellow!” he said to Pierre. “What troubles<br>one has with these girls without their mother! I do so regret having<br>come here.... I will be frank with you. Have you heard she has broken<br>off her engagement without consulting anybody? It’s true this engagement<br>never was much to my liking. Of course he is an excellent man, but<br>still, with his father’s disapproval they wouldn’t have been happy, and<br>Natásha won’t lack suitors. Still, it has been going on so long, and<br>to take such a step without father’s or mother’s consent! And now she’s<br>ill, and God knows what! It’s hard, Count, hard to manage daughters in<br>their mother’s absence....”<br><br>Pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the<br>subject, but the count returned to his troubles.<br><br>Sónya entered the room with an agitated face.<br><br>“Natásha is not quite well; she’s in her room and would like to see you.<br>Márya Dmítrievna is with her and she too asks you to come.”<br><br>“Yes, you are a great friend of Bolkónski’s, no doubt she wants to send<br>him a message,” said the count. “Oh dear! Oh dear! How happy it all<br>was!”<br><br>And clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the<br>room.<br><br>When Márya Dmítrievna told Natásha that Anatole was married, Natásha<br>did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by Pierre<br>himself. Sónya told Pierre this as she led him along the corridor to<br>Natásha’s room.<br><br>Natásha, pale and stern, was sitting beside Márya Dmítrievna, and her<br>eyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look the<br>moment he entered. She did not smile or nod, but only gazed fixedly at<br>him, and her look asked only one thing: was he a friend, or like the<br>others an enemy in regard to Anatole? As for Pierre, he evidently did<br>not exist for her.<br><br>“He knows all about it,” said Márya Dmítrievna pointing to Pierre and<br>addressing Natásha. “Let him tell you whether I have told the truth.”<br><br>Natásha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal<br>looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.<br><br>“Natálya Ilyníchna,” Pierre began, dropping his eyes with a feeling of<br>pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do, “whether it is<br>true or not should make no difference to you, because...”<br><br>“Then it is not true that he’s married!”<br><br>“Yes, it is true.”<br><br>“Has he been married long?” she asked. “On your honor?...”<br><br>Pierre gave his word of honor.<br><br>“Is he still here?” she asked, quickly.<br><br>“Yes, I have just seen him.”<br><br>She was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that<br>they should leave her alone.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XX<br><br>Pierre did not stay for dinner, but left the room and went away at once.<br>He drove through the town seeking Anatole Kurágin, at the thought of<br>whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in<br>breathing. He was not at the ice hills, nor at the gypsies’, nor at<br>Komoneno’s. Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all was going on as<br>usual. The members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about<br>in groups; they greeted Pierre and spoke of the town news. The footman<br>having greeted him, knowing his habits and his acquaintances, told him<br>there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that Prince<br>Michael Zakhárych was in the library, but Paul Timoféevich had not yet<br>arrived. One of Pierre’s acquaintances, while they were talking about<br>the weather, asked if he had heard of Kurágin’s abduction of Rostóva<br>which was talked of in the town, and was it true? Pierre laughed and<br>said it was nonsense for he had just come from the Rostóvs’. He asked<br>everyone about Anatole. One man told him he had not come yet, and<br>another that he was coming to dinner. Pierre felt it strange to see this<br>calm, indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his<br>soul. He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come, and<br>as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home.<br><br>Anatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with Dólokhov,<br>consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to<br>him essential to see Natásha. In the evening he drove to his sister’s<br>to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home<br>after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince<br>Anatole was with the countess. The countess’ drawing room was full of<br>guests.<br><br>Pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his<br>return—at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever—entered<br>the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him.<br><br>“Ah, Pierre,” said the countess going up to her husband. “You don’t know<br>what a plight our Anatole...”<br><br>She stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband’s head, in his<br>glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that<br>rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his<br>duel with Dólokhov.<br><br>“Where you are, there is vice and evil!” said Pierre to his wife.<br>“Anatole, come with me! I must speak to you,” he added in French.<br><br>Anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to<br>follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself<br>and was leading him from the room.<br><br>“If you allow yourself in my drawing room...” whispered Hélène, but<br>Pierre did not reply and went out of the room.<br><br>Anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed<br>anxiety.<br><br>Having entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole<br>without looking at him.<br><br>“You promised Countess Rostóva to marry her and were about to elope with<br>her, is that so?”<br><br>“Mon cher,” answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in French),<br>“I don’t consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that<br>tone.”<br><br>Pierre’s face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized Anatole<br>by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side<br>to side till Anatole’s face showed a sufficient degree of terror.<br><br>“When I tell you that I must talk to you!...” repeated Pierre.<br><br>“Come now, this is stupid. What?” said Anatole, fingering a button of<br>his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth.<br><br>“You’re a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don’t know what deprives<br>me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!” said Pierre,<br>expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French.<br><br>He took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once put<br>it back in its place.<br><br>“Did you promise to marry her?”<br><br>“I... I didn’t think of it. I never promised, because...”<br><br>Pierre interrupted him.<br><br>“Have you any letters of hers? Any letters?” he said, moving toward<br>Anatole.<br><br>Anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket<br>and drew out his pocketbook.<br><br>Pierre took the letter Anatole handed him and, pushing aside a table<br>that stood in his way, threw himself on the sofa.<br><br>“I shan’t be violent, don’t be afraid!” said Pierre in answer to a<br>frightened gesture of Anatole’s. “First, the letters,” said he, as if<br>repeating a lesson to himself. “Secondly,” he continued after a short<br>pause, again rising and again pacing the room, “tomorrow you must get<br>out of Moscow.”<br><br>“But how can I?...”<br><br>“Thirdly,” Pierre continued without listening to him, “you must never<br>breathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess Rostóva.<br>I know I can’t prevent your doing so, but if you have a spark of<br>conscience...” Pierre paced the room several times in silence.<br><br>Anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.<br><br>“After all, you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such<br>a thing as other people’s happiness and peace, and that you are ruining<br>a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself! Amuse yourself with women<br>like my wife—with them you are within your rights, for they know what<br>you want of them. They are armed against you by the same experience<br>of debauchery; but to promise a maid to marry her... to deceive, to<br>kidnap.... Don’t you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man<br>or a child?...”<br><br>Pierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with a<br>questioning look.<br><br>“I don’t know about that, eh?” said Anatole, growing more confident as<br>Pierre mastered his wrath. “I don’t know that and don’t want to,” he<br>said, not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw,<br>“but you have used such words to me—‘mean’ and so on—which as a man of<br>honor I can’t allow anyone to use.”<br><br>Pierre glanced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he<br>wanted.<br><br>“Though it was tête-à-tête,” Anatole continued, “still I can’t...”<br><br>“Is it satisfaction you want?” said Pierre ironically.<br><br>“You could at least take back your words. What? If you want me to do as<br>you wish, eh?”<br><br>“I take them back, I take them back!” said Pierre, “and I ask you to<br>forgive me.” Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button. “And if<br>you require money for your journey...”<br><br>Anatole smiled. The expression of that base and cringing smile, which<br>Pierre knew so well in his wife, revolted him.<br><br>“Oh, vile and heartless brood!” he exclaimed, and left the room.<br><br>Next day Anatole left for Petersburg.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXI<br><br>Pierre drove to Márya Dmítrievna’s to tell her of the fulfillment of her<br>wish that Kurágin should be banished from Moscow. The whole house was in<br>a state of alarm and commotion. Natásha was very ill, having, as Márya<br>Dmítrievna told him in secret, poisoned herself the night after she had<br>been told that Anatole was married, with some arsenic she had stealthily<br>procured. After swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she<br>woke Sónya and told her what she had done. The necessary antidotes had<br>been administered in time and she was now out of danger, though still so<br>weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country, and<br>so the countess had been sent for. Pierre saw the distracted count, and<br>Sónya, who had a tear-stained face, but he could not see Natásha.<br><br>Pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about<br>the attempted abduction of Rostóva. He resolutely denied these<br>rumors, assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his<br>brother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused. It seemed to<br>Pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and re-establish<br>Natásha’s reputation.<br><br>He was awaiting Prince Andrew’s return with dread and went every day to<br>the old prince’s for news of him.<br><br>Old Prince Bolkónski heard all the rumors current in the town from<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which<br>Natásha had broken off her engagement. He seemed in better spirits than<br>usual and awaited his son with great impatience.<br><br>Some days after Anatole’s departure Pierre received a note from Prince<br>Andrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him.<br><br>As soon as he reached Moscow, Prince Andrew had received from his<br>father Natásha’s note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement<br>(Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and given<br>it to the old prince), and he heard from him the story of Natásha’s<br>elopement, with additions.<br><br>Prince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to see him next<br>morning. Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost the same state<br>as Natásha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room<br>to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some<br>intrigue going on in Petersburg. The old prince’s voice and another now<br>and then interrupted him. Princess Mary came out to meet Pierre. She<br>sighed, looking toward the door of the room where Prince Andrew was,<br>evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow, but Pierre<br>saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the<br>way her brother had taken the news of Natásha’s faithlessness.<br><br>“He says he expected it,” she remarked. “I know his pride will not let<br>him express his feelings, but still he has taken it better, far better,<br>than I expected. Evidently it had to be....”<br><br>“But is it possible that all is really ended?” asked Pierre.<br><br>Princess Mary looked at him with astonishment. She did not understand<br>how he could ask such a question. Pierre went into the study. Prince<br>Andrew, greatly changed and plainly in better health, but with a fresh<br>horizontal wrinkle between his brows, stood in civilian dress facing<br>his father and Prince Meshchérski, warmly disputing and vigorously<br>gesticulating. The conversation was about Speránski—the news of whose<br>sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached Moscow.<br><br>“Now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him<br>a month ago,” Prince Andrew was saying, “and by those who were unable to<br>understand his aims. To judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on<br>him all the blame of other men’s mistakes is very easy, but I maintain<br>that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by<br>him, by him alone.”<br><br>He paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and immediately<br>assumed a vindictive expression.<br><br>“Posterity will do him justice,” he concluded, and at once turned to<br>Pierre.<br><br>“Well, how are you? Still getting stouter?” he said with animation, but<br>the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. “Yes, I am well,” he said in<br>answer to Pierre’s question, and smiled.<br><br>To Pierre that smile said plainly: “I am well, but my health is now of<br>no use to anyone.”<br><br>After a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish<br>frontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre, and<br>about M. Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his son’s<br>tutor, Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about<br>Speránski which was still going on between the two old men.<br><br>“If there were treason, or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon,<br>they would have been made public,” he said with warmth and haste. “I do<br>not, and never did, like Speránski personally, but I like justice!”<br><br>Pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too<br>familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters<br>in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate.<br>When Prince Meshchérski had left, Prince Andrew took Pierre’s arm and<br>asked him into the room that had been assigned him. A bed had been made<br>up there, and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about. Prince<br>Andrew went to one and took out a small casket, from which he drew a<br>packet wrapped in paper. He did it all silently and very quickly. He<br>stood up and coughed. His face was gloomy and his lips compressed.<br><br>“Forgive me for troubling you....”<br><br>Pierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Natásha, and his<br>broad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated Prince<br>Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he continued:<br><br>“I have received a refusal from Countess Rostóva and have heard reports<br>of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that<br>kind. Is that true?”<br><br>“Both true and untrue,” Pierre began; but Prince Andrew interrupted him.<br><br>“Here are her letters and her portrait,” said he.<br><br>He took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.<br><br>“Give this to the countess... if you see her.”<br><br>“She is very ill,” said Pierre.<br><br>“Then she is here still?” said Prince Andrew. “And Prince Kurágin?” he<br>added quickly.<br><br>“He left long ago. She has been at death’s door.”<br><br>“I much regret her illness,” said Prince Andrew; and he smiled like his<br>father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly.<br><br>“So Monsieur Kurágin has not honored Countess Rostóva with his hand?”<br>said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times.<br><br>“He could not marry, for he was married already,” said Pierre.<br><br>Prince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father.<br><br>“And where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?” he said.<br><br>“He has gone to Peters... But I don’t know,” said Pierre.<br><br>“Well, it doesn’t matter,” said Prince Andrew. “Tell Countess Rostóva<br>that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is<br>good.”<br><br>Pierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember whether<br>he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would say<br>anything, looked fixedly at him.<br><br>“I say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?” asked Pierre,<br>“about...”<br><br>“Yes,” returned Prince Andrew hastily. “I said that a fallen woman<br>should be forgiven, but I didn’t say I could forgive her. I can’t.”<br><br>“But can this be compared...?” said Pierre.<br><br>Prince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: “Yes, ask her hand<br>again, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very noble, but<br>I am unable to follow in that gentleman’s footsteps. If you wish to be<br>my friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well, good-by. So<br>you’ll give her the packet?”<br><br>Pierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary.<br><br>The old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same as<br>always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed her<br>satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at them<br>Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the<br>Rostóvs, and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention<br>the name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone else.<br><br>At dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was becoming<br>evident. Prince Andrew talked incessantly, arguing now with his father,<br>now with the Swiss tutor Dessalles, and showing an unnatural animation,<br>the cause of which Pierre so well understood.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXII<br><br>That same evening Pierre went to the Rostóvs’ to fulfill the commission<br>entrusted to him. Natásha was in bed, the count at the club, and Pierre,<br>after giving the letters to Sónya, went to Márya Dmítrievna who was<br>interested to know how Prince Andrew had taken the news. Ten minutes<br>later Sónya came to Márya Dmítrievna.<br><br>“Natásha insists on seeing Count Peter Kirílovich,” said she.<br><br>“But how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there has not been<br>tidied up.”<br><br>“No, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room,” said Sónya.<br><br>Márya Dmítrievna only shrugged her shoulders.<br><br>“When will her mother come? She has worried me to death! Now mind, don’t<br>tell her everything!” said she to Pierre. “One hasn’t the heart to scold<br>her, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be pitied.”<br><br>Natásha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated, with<br>a pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected to find<br>her. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently undecided<br>whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.<br><br>Pierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her hand as<br>usual; but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, her arms<br>hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she<br>went to the middle of the ballroom to sing, but with quite a different<br>expression of face.<br><br>“Peter Kirílovich,” she began rapidly, “Prince Bolkónski was your<br>friend—is your friend,” she corrected herself. (It seemed to her that<br>everything that had once been must now be different.) “He told me once<br>to apply to you...”<br><br>Pierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did not speak. Till then he had<br>reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her, but he now felt so<br>sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach.<br><br>“He is here now: tell him... to for... forgive me!” She stopped and<br>breathed still more quickly, but did not shed tears.<br><br>“Yes... I will tell him,” answered Pierre; “but...”<br><br>He did not know what to say.<br><br>Natásha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she<br>had meant.<br><br>“No, I know all is over,” she said hurriedly. “No, that can never be.<br>I’m only tormented by the wrong I have done him. Tell him only that I<br>beg him to forgive, forgive, forgive me for everything....”<br><br>She trembled all over and sat down on a chair.<br><br>A sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierre’s heart.<br><br>“I will tell him, I will tell him everything once more,” said Pierre.<br>“But... I should like to know one thing....”<br><br>“Know what?” Natásha’s eyes asked.<br><br>“I should like to know, did you love...” Pierre did not know how to<br>refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of him—“did you love that<br>bad man?”<br><br>“Don’t call him bad!” said Natásha. “But I don’t know, don’t know at<br>all....”<br><br>She began to cry and a still greater sense of pity, tenderness, and love<br>welled up in Pierre. He felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and<br>hoped they would not be noticed.<br><br>“We won’t speak of it any more, my dear,” said Pierre, and his gentle,<br>cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to Natásha.<br><br>“We won’t speak of it, my dear—I’ll tell him everything; but one thing<br>I beg of you, consider me your friend and if you want help, advice,<br>or simply to open your heart to someone—not now, but when your mind is<br>clearer think of me!” He took her hand and kissed it. “I shall be happy<br>if it’s in my power...”<br><br>Pierre grew confused.<br><br>“Don’t speak to me like that. I am not worth it!” exclaimed Natásha and<br>turned to leave the room, but Pierre held her hand.<br><br>He knew he had something more to say to her. But when he said it he was<br>amazed at his own words.<br><br>“Stop, stop! You have your whole life before you,” said he to her.<br><br>“Before me? No! All is over for me,” she replied with shame and<br>self-abasement.<br><br>“All over?” he repeated. “If I were not myself, but the handsomest,<br>cleverest, and best man in the world, and were free, I would this moment<br>ask on my knees for your hand and your love!”<br><br>For the first time for many days Natásha wept tears of gratitude and<br>tenderness, and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room.<br><br>Pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom, restraining<br>tears of tenderness and joy that choked him, and without finding the<br>sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh.<br><br>“Where to now, your excellency?” asked the coachman.<br><br>“Where to?” Pierre asked himself. “Where can I go now? Surely not to the<br>Club or to pay calls?” All men seemed so pitiful, so poor, in comparison<br>with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced: in comparison<br>with that softened, grateful, last look she had given him through her<br>tears.<br><br>“Home!” said Pierre, and despite twenty-two degrees of frost Fahrenheit<br>he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the<br>air with joy.<br><br>It was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the<br>black roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking up at the sky<br>did Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane<br>things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised.<br>At the entrance to the Arbát Square an immense expanse of dark starry<br>sky presented itself to his eyes. Almost in the center of it, above the<br>Prechístenka Boulevard, surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars<br>but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth, its white<br>light, and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous and brilliant<br>comet of 1812—the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes<br>and the end of the world. In Pierre, however, that comet with its long<br>luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the contrary he gazed<br>joyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright comet which, having<br>traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable<br>space, seemed suddenly—like an arrow piercing the earth—to remain<br>fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its tail erect, shining and<br>displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars. It<br>seemed to Pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in<br>his own softened and uplifted soul, now blossoming into a new life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK NINE: 1812<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>From the close of the year 1811 intensified arming and concentrating of<br>the forces of Western Europe began, and in 1812 these forces—millions<br>of men, reckoning those transporting and feeding the army—moved from the<br>west eastwards to the Russian frontier, toward which since 1811 Russian<br>forces had been similarly drawn. On the twelfth of June, 1812, the<br>forces of Western Europe crossed the Russian frontier and war began,<br>that is, an event took place opposed to human reason and to human<br>nature. Millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable<br>crimes, frauds, treacheries, thefts, forgeries, issues of false money,<br>burglaries, incendiarisms, and murders as in whole centuries are not<br>recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world, but which<br>those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes.<br><br>What produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its causes? The<br>historians tell us with naïve assurance that its causes were the wrongs<br>inflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the Continental<br>System, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of Alexander, the<br>mistakes of the diplomatists, and so on.<br><br>Consequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich,<br>Rumyántsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to have<br>taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for Napoleon to<br>have written to Alexander: “My respected Brother, I consent to restore<br>the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburg”—and there would have been no war.<br><br>We can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries.<br>It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by England’s<br>intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St. Helena). It naturally<br>seemed to members of the English Parliament that the cause of the war<br>was Napoleon’s ambition; to the Duke of Oldenburg, that the cause of the<br>war was the violence done to him; to businessmen that the cause of the<br>war was the Continental System which was ruining Europe; to the generals<br>and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of<br>giving them employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the<br>need of re-establishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of<br>that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between<br>Russia and Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed<br>from Napoleon, and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178. It<br>is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other<br>reasons, the number depending on the endless diversity of points<br>of view, presented themselves to the men of that day; but to us, to<br>posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and<br>perceive its plain and terrible meaning, these causes seem insufficient.<br>To us it is incomprehensible that millions of Christian men killed and<br>tortured each other either because Napoleon was ambitious or Alexander<br>was firm, or because England’s policy was astute or the Duke of<br>Oldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances<br>have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the<br>Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed<br>and ruined the people of Smolénsk and Moscow and were killed by them.<br><br>To us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried<br>away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event<br>with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present<br>themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of<br>them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears<br>to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance<br>compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence—apart<br>from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes—to occasion the<br>event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to<br>serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon’s refusal to<br>withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of<br>Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third,<br>and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have<br>been so many less men in Napoleon’s army and the war could not have<br>occurred.<br><br>Had Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw<br>beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would<br>have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second<br>term then also there could have been no war. Nor could there have been<br>a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and<br>had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic<br>government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent<br>dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French<br>Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have<br>happened. So all these causes—myriads of causes—coincided to bring it<br>about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had<br>to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human<br>feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows,<br>just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east<br>to the west, slaying their fellows.<br><br>The actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed<br>to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was<br>drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not be<br>otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom<br>the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of<br>innumerable circumstances was needed without anyone of which the event<br>could not have taken place. It was necessary that millions of men in<br>whose hands lay the real power—the soldiers who fired, or transported<br>provisions and guns—should consent to carry out the will of these weak<br>individuals, and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number<br>of diverse and complex causes.<br><br>We are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational<br>events (that is to say, events the reasonableness of which we do<br>not understand). The more we try to explain such events in history<br>reasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to<br>us.<br><br>Each man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his personal<br>aims, and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from<br>doing this or that action; but as soon as he has done it, that action<br>performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to<br>history, in which it has not a free but a predestined significance.<br><br>There are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life, which<br>is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his elemental hive<br>life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him.<br><br>Man lives consciously for himself, but is an unconscious instrument in<br>the attainment of the historic, universal, aims of humanity. A deed done<br>is irrevocable, and its result coinciding in time with the actions of<br>millions of other men assumes an historic significance. The higher a man<br>stands on the social ladder, the more people he is connected with<br>and the more power he has over others, the more evident is the<br>predestination and inevitability of his every action.<br><br>“The king’s heart is in the hands of the Lord.”<br><br>A king is history’s slave.<br><br>History, that is, the unconscious, general, hive life of mankind, uses<br>every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes.<br><br>Though Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was more convinced than ever that<br>it depended on him, verser (ou ne pas verser) le sang de ses peuples<br>*—as Alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him—he had never<br>been so much in the grip of inevitable laws, which compelled him, while<br>thinking that he was acting on his own volition, to perform for the hive<br>life—that is to say, for history—whatever had to be performed.<br><br>    * “To shed (or not to shed) the blood of his peoples.”<br><br><br>The people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men, and<br>by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and<br>co-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches for the<br>nonobservance of the Continental System, the Duke of Oldenburg’s<br>wrongs, the movement of troops into Prussia—undertaken (as it seemed to<br>Napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace, the<br>French Emperor’s love and habit of war coinciding with his people’s<br>inclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the preparations, and the<br>expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages<br>to compensate for that expenditure, the intoxicating honors he received<br>in Dresden, the diplomatic negotiations which, in the opinion of<br>contemporaries, were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace,<br>but which only wounded the self-love of both sides, and millions of<br>other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or<br>coincided with it.<br><br>When an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of its<br>attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it is dried<br>by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes it, or<br>because the boy standing below wants to eat it?<br><br>Nothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions in<br>which all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the botanist<br>who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so<br>forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says<br>the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it. Equally<br>right or wrong is he who says that Napoleon went to Moscow because he<br>wanted to, and perished because Alexander desired his destruction, and<br>he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because<br>the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock. In historic<br>events the so-called great men are labels giving names to events, and<br>like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself.<br><br>Every act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will, is<br>in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of<br>history and predestined from eternity.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>On the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden, where he had spent<br>three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes, dukes, kings,<br>and even an emperor. Before leaving, Napoleon showed favor to the<br>emperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings<br>and princes with whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and diamonds<br>of his own—that is, which he had taken from other kings—to the Empress<br>of Austria, and having, as his historian tells us, tenderly embraced the<br>Empress Marie Louise—who regarded him as her husband, though he had left<br>another wife in Paris—left her grieved by the parting which she seemed<br>hardly able to bear. Though the diplomatists still firmly believed in<br>the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end, and though<br>the Emperor Napoleon himself wrote a letter to Alexander, calling him<br>Monsieur mon frère, and sincerely assured him that he did not want war<br>and would always love and honor him—yet he set off to join his army,<br>and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his<br>troops from west to east. He went in a traveling coach with six horses,<br>surrounded by pages, aides-de-camp, and an escort, along the road to<br>Posen, Thorn, Danzig, and Königsberg. At each of these towns thousands<br>of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm.<br><br>The army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses carried<br>him in the same direction. On the tenth of June, * coming up with the<br>army, he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of<br>a Polish count in the Vilkavisski forest.<br><br>    * Old style.<br><br>Next day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the Niemen, and,<br>changing into a Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank in order to<br>select a place for the crossing.<br><br>Seeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (les Cosaques) and the<br>wide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of Moscow<br>(Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the Scythia<br>into which Alexander the Great had marched—Napoleon unexpectedly, and<br>contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations, ordered an<br>advance, and the next day his army began to cross the Niemen.<br><br>Early in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of his tent,<br>which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and<br>looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of<br>the Vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across<br>the river. The troops, knowing of the Emperor’s presence, were on the<br>lookout for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat<br>and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on<br>the hill, they threw up their caps and shouted: “Vive l’Empereur!” and<br>one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest<br>that had concealed them and, separating, flowed on and on by the three<br>bridges to the other side.<br><br>“Now we’ll go into action. Oh, when he takes it in hand himself, things<br>get hot... by heaven!... There he is!... Vive l’Empereur! So these<br>are the steppes of Asia! It’s a nasty country all the same. Au revoir,<br>Beauché; I’ll keep the best palace in Moscow for you! Au revoir. Good<br>luck!... Did you see the Emperor? Vive l’Empereur!... preur!—If<br>they make me Governor of India, Gérard, I’ll make you Minister of<br>Kashmir—that’s settled. Vive l’Empereur! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! The<br>Cossacks—those rascals—see how they run! Vive l’Empereur! There he<br>is, do you see him? I’ve seen him twice, as I see you now. The little<br>corporal... I saw him give the cross to one of the veterans.... Vive<br>l’Empereur!” came the voices of men, old and young, of most diverse<br>characters and social positions. On the faces of all was one common<br>expression of joy at the commencement of the long-expected campaign and<br>of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on<br>the hill.<br><br>On the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab horse was<br>brought to Napoleon. He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the<br>bridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by incessant and rapturous<br>acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible<br>to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting,<br>but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and<br>distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the<br>time he joined the army. He rode across one of the swaying pontoon<br>bridges to the farther side, turned sharply to the left, and galloped in<br>the direction of Kóvno, preceded by enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the<br>Guard who, breathless with delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for<br>him through the troops. On reaching the broad river Víliya, he stopped<br>near a regiment of Polish Uhlans stationed by the river.<br><br>“Vivat!” shouted the Poles, ecstatically, breaking their ranks and<br>pressing against one another to see him.<br><br>Napoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a log<br>that lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope was handed<br>him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him,<br>and he gazed at the opposite bank. Then he became absorbed in a map laid<br>out on the logs. Without lifting his head he said something, and two of<br>his aides-de-camp galloped off to the Polish Uhlans.<br><br>“What? What did he say?” was heard in the ranks of the Polish Uhlans<br>when one of the aides-de-camp rode up to them.<br><br>The order was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel of the<br>Polish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in his speech<br>from excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether he would be permitted<br>to swim the river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a ford. In evident<br>fear of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse, he<br>begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the Emperor’s<br>eyes. The aide-de-camp replied that probably the Emperor would not be<br>displeased at this excess of zeal.<br><br>As soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached officer,<br>with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted “Vivat!”<br>and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse and galloped<br>into the river. He gave an angry thrust to his horse, which had grown<br>restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest<br>part where the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans galloped in after<br>him. It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the<br>stream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their<br>horses. Some of the horses were drowned and some of the men; the others<br>tried to swim on, some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses’<br>manes. They tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and,<br>though there was a ford one third of a mile away, were proud that they<br>were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who<br>sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing. When<br>the aide-de-camp, having returned and choosing an opportune moment,<br>ventured to draw the Emperor’s attention to the devotion of the Poles<br>to his person, the little man in the gray overcoat got up and, having<br>summoned Berthier, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving<br>him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the<br>drowning Uhlans who distracted his attention.<br><br>For him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of<br>the world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough to<br>dumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion. He called for<br>his horse and rode to his quarters.<br><br>Some forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were sent to<br>their assistance. The majority struggled back to the bank from which<br>they had started. The colonel and some of his men got across and with<br>difficulty clambered out on the further bank. And as soon as they had<br>got out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted “Vivat!”<br>and looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been but where he<br>no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy.<br><br>That evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian paper<br>money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as quickly as<br>possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a letter<br>containing information about the orders to the French army had been<br>found, Napoleon also gave instructions that the Polish colonel who<br>had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the Légion<br>d’honneur of which Napoleon was himself the head.<br><br>Quos vult perdere dementat. *<br><br>    * Those whom (God) wishes to destroy he drives mad.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>The Emperor of Russia had, meanwhile, been in Vílna for more than a<br>month, reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. Nothing was ready for the<br>war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor had come<br>from Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The vacillation<br>between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after<br>the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month. Each of the three<br>armies had its own commander in chief, but there was no supreme<br>commander of all the forces, and the Emperor did not assume that<br>responsibility himself.<br><br>The longer the Emperor remained in Vílna the less did everybody—tired of<br>waiting—prepare for the war. All the efforts of those who surrounded the<br>sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly<br>and forget that war was impending.<br><br>In June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by the<br>courtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the Polish<br>aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for<br>the Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly received.<br>The Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected money by<br>subscription. The lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the<br>Emperor was invited to act as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a<br>landowner in the Vílna province, offered his country house for the fete,<br>and the thirteenth of June was fixed for a ball, dinner, regatta, and<br>fireworks at Zakret, Count Bennigsen’s country seat.<br><br>The very day that Napoleon issued the order to cross the Niemen, and<br>his vanguard, driving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian frontier,<br>Alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his<br>aides-de-camp at Bennigsen’s country house.<br><br>It was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs of such matters declared<br>that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place.<br>Countess Bezúkhova was present among other Russian ladies who had<br>followed the sovereign from Petersburg to Vílna and eclipsed the refined<br>Polish ladies by her massive, so-called Russian type of beauty. The<br>Emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance.<br><br>Borís Drubetskóy, having left his wife in Moscow and being for the<br>present en garçon (as he phrased it), was also there and, though not an<br>aide-de-camp, had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses. Borís<br>was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought<br>patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his<br>own age. He was meeting Hélène in Vílna after not having seen her for<br>a long time and did not recall the past, but as Hélène was enjoying<br>the favors of a very important personage and Borís had only recently<br>married, they met as good friends of long standing.<br><br>At midnight dancing was still going on. Hélène, not having a suitable<br>partner, herself offered to dance the mazurka with Borís. They were the<br>third couple. Borís, coolly looking at Hélène’s dazzling bare shoulders<br>which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze gown, talked to her<br>of old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware of it himself and<br>unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased to observe the Emperor<br>who was in the same room. The Emperor was not dancing, he stood in the<br>doorway, stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which<br>he alone knew how to utter.<br><br>As the mazurka began, Borís saw that Adjutant General Balashëv, one of<br>those in closest attendance on the Emperor, went up to him and contrary<br>to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a Polish<br>lady. Having finished speaking to her, the Emperor looked inquiringly<br>at Balashëv and, evidently understanding that he only acted thus because<br>there were important reasons for so doing, nodded slightly to the lady<br>and turned to him. Hardly had Balashëv begun to speak before a look of<br>amazement appeared on the Emperor’s face. He took Balashëv by the arm<br>and crossed the room with him, unconsciously clearing a path seven<br>yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him. Borís noticed<br>Arakchéev’s excited face when the sovereign went out with Balashëv.<br>Arakchéev looked at the Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with<br>his red nose, stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor<br>to address him. (Borís understood that Arakchéev envied Balashëv and<br>was displeased that evidently important news had reached the Emperor<br>otherwise than through himself.)<br><br>But the Emperor and Balashëv passed out into the illuminated garden<br>without noticing Arakchéev who, holding his sword and glancing<br>wrathfully around, followed some twenty paces behind them.<br><br>All the time Borís was going through the figures of the mazurka, he was<br>worried by the question of what news Balashëv had brought and how he<br>could find it out before others. In the figure in which he had to choose<br>two ladies, he whispered to Hélène that he meant to choose Countess<br>Potocka who, he thought, had gone out onto the veranda, and glided over<br>the parquet to the door opening into the garden, where, seeing Balashëv<br>and the Emperor returning to the veranda, he stood still. They were<br>moving toward the door. Borís, fluttering as if he had not had time to<br>withdraw, respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head.<br><br>The Emperor, with the agitation of one who has been personally<br>affronted, was finishing with these words:<br><br>“To enter Russia without declaring war! I will not make peace as long as<br>a single armed enemy remains in my country!” It seemed to Borís that it<br>gave the Emperor pleasure to utter these words. He was satisfied with<br>the form in which he had expressed his thoughts, but displeased that<br>Borís had overheard it.<br><br>“Let no one know of it!” the Emperor added with a frown.<br><br>Borís understood that this was meant for him and, closing his eyes,<br>slightly bowed his head. The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and<br>remained there about another half-hour.<br><br>Borís was thus the first to learn the news that the French army had<br>crossed the Niemen and, thanks to this, was able to show certain<br>important personages that much that was concealed from others was<br>usually known to him, and by this means he rose higher in their<br>estimation.<br><br><br>The unexpected news of the French having crossed the Niemen was<br>particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations, and at<br>a ball. On first receiving the news, under the influence of indignation<br>and resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that pleased him, fully<br>expressed his feelings, and has since become famous. On returning home<br>at two o’clock that night he sent for his secretary, Shishkóv, and told<br>him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to Field Marshal<br>Prince Saltykóv, in which he insisted on the words being inserted that<br>he would not make peace so long as a single armed Frenchman remained on<br>Russian soil.<br><br>Next day the following letter was sent to Napoleon:<br><br>Monsieur mon frère,<br><br>Yesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty with which I have kept<br>my engagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed the Russian<br>frontier, and I have this moment received from Petersburg a note, in<br>which Count Lauriston informs me, as a reason for this aggression, that<br>Your Majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me<br>from the time Prince Kurákin asked for his passports. The reasons on<br>which the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would<br>never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for<br>aggression. In fact, the ambassador, as he himself has declared, was<br>never authorized to make that demand, and as soon as I was informed of<br>it I let him know how much I disapproved of it and ordered him to remain<br>at his post. If Your Majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our<br>peoples for such a misunderstanding, and consents to withdraw your<br>troops from Russian territory, I will regard what has passed as not<br>having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible. In<br>the contrary case, Your Majesty, I shall see myself forced to repel an<br>attack that nothing on my part has provoked. It still depends on Your<br>Majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war.<br><br>I am, etc.,<br><br>(signed) Alexander<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>At two in the morning of the fourteenth of June, the Emperor, having<br>sent for Balashëv and read him his letter to Napoleon, ordered him to<br>take it and hand it personally to the French Emperor. When dispatching<br>Balashëv, the Emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make<br>peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on Russian soil and told<br>him to transmit those words to Napoleon. Alexander did not insert them<br>in his letter to Napoleon, because with his characteristic tact he felt<br>it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at<br>reconciliation was being made, but he definitely instructed Balashëv to<br>repeat them personally to Napoleon.<br><br>Having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied by a<br>bugler and two Cossacks, Balashëv reached the French outposts at the<br>village of Rykónty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, by dawn. There he<br>was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.<br><br>A French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform and a<br>shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching Balashëv to halt. Balashëv did<br>not do so at once, but continued to advance along the road at a walking<br>pace.<br><br>The noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of abuse,<br>advanced his horse’s chest against Balashëv, put his hand to his saber,<br>and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: was he deaf that<br>he did not do as he was told? Balashëv mentioned who he was. The<br>noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental<br>matters without looking at the Russian general.<br><br>After living at the seat of the highest authority and power, after<br>conversing with the Emperor less than three hours before, and in general<br>being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service, Balashëv<br>found it very strange here on Russian soil to encounter this hostile,<br>and still more this disrespectful, application of brute force to<br>himself.<br><br>The sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds, the air was<br>fresh and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along the road from<br>the village, and over the fields the larks rose trilling, one after<br>another, like bubbles rising in water.<br><br>Balashëv looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer from the<br>village. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French hussars looked<br>silently at one another from time to time.<br><br>A French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed, came<br>riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, accompanied<br>by two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their horses all looked<br>smart and well kept.<br><br>It was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full<br>trim, almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of<br>martial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spirit<br>of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign.<br><br>The French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn, but was polite and<br>evidently understood Balashëv’s importance. He led him past his soldiers<br>and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to<br>the Emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately, as the Emperor’s<br>quarters were, he believed, not far off.<br><br>They rode through the village of Rykónty, past tethered French hussar<br>horses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with<br>curiosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at the other end of the<br>village. The colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile<br>and a quarter away and would receive Balashëv and conduct him to his<br>destination.<br><br>The sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure.<br><br>They had hardly ridden up a hill, past a tavern, before they saw a group<br>of horsemen coming toward them. In front of the group, on a black horse<br>with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall man with plumes<br>in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders. He wore a red<br>mantle, and stretched his long legs forward in French fashion. This man<br>rode toward Balashëv at a gallop, his plumes flowing and his gems and<br>gold lace glittering in the bright June sunshine.<br><br>Balashëv was only two horses’ length from the equestrian with the<br>bracelets, plumes, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was galloping<br>toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when Julner, the<br>French colonel, whispered respectfully: “The King of Naples!” It was,<br>in fact, Murat, now called “King of Naples.” Though it was quite<br>incomprehensible why he should be King of Naples, he was called so,<br>and was himself convinced that he was so, and therefore assumed a more<br>solemn and important air than formerly. He was so sure that he really<br>was the King of Naples that when, on the eve of his departure from that<br>city, while walking through the streets with his wife, some Italians<br>called out to him: “Viva il re!” * he turned to his wife with a pensive<br>smile and said: “Poor fellows, they don’t know that I am leaving them<br>tomorrow!”<br><br>    * “Long live the king.”<br><br><br>But though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples and pitied<br>the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly, after he had<br>been ordered to return to military service—and especially since his last<br>interview with Napoleon in Danzig, when his august brother-in-law had<br>told him: “I made you King that you should reign in my way, but not in<br>yours!”—he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business, and—like a<br>well-fed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows<br>skittish between the shafts—he dressed up in clothes as variegated and<br>expensive as possible, and gaily and contentedly galloped along the<br>roads of Poland, without himself knowing why or whither.<br><br>On seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with its long hair<br>curling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal manner, and looked<br>inquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel respectfully informed His<br>Majesty of Balashëv’s mission, whose name he could not pronounce.<br><br>“De Bal-machève!” said the King (overcoming by his assurance the<br>difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). “Charmed to<br>make your acquaintance, General!” he added, with a gesture of kingly<br>condescension.<br><br>As soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity<br>instantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his<br>natural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his hand on the<br>withers of Balashëv’s horse and said:<br><br>“Well, General, it all looks like war,” as if regretting a circumstance<br>of which he was unable to judge.<br><br>“Your Majesty,” replied Balashëv, “my master, the Emperor, does not<br>desire war and as Your Majesty sees...” said Balashëv, using the words<br>Your Majesty at every opportunity, with the affectation unavoidable in<br>frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty.<br><br>Murat’s face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to “Monsieur<br>de Bal-machève.” But royauté oblige! * and he felt it incumbent on<br>him, as a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs with Alexander’s<br>envoy. He dismounted, took Balashëv’s arm, and moving a few steps away<br>from his suite, which waited respectfully, began to pace up and down<br>with him, trying to speak significantly. He referred to the fact that<br>the Emperor Napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his<br>troops from Prussia, especially when that demand became generally known<br>and the dignity of France was thereby offended.<br><br>    * “Royalty has its obligations.”<br><br><br>Balashëv replied that there was “nothing offensive in the demand,<br>because...” but Murat interrupted him.<br><br>“Then you don’t consider the Emperor Alexander the aggressor?” he asked<br>unexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.<br><br>Balashëv told him why he considered Napoleon to be the originator of the<br>war.<br><br>“Oh, my dear general!” Murat again interrupted him, “with all my heart I<br>wish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them, and that the war<br>begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible!” said he,<br>in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another<br>despite a quarrel between their masters.<br><br>And he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of his<br>health, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent<br>with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering his royal dignity,<br>Murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which he had stood<br>at his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:<br><br>“I won’t detain you longer, General. I wish success to your mission,”<br>and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers, and his<br>glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were respectfully<br>awaiting him.<br><br>Balashëv rode on, supposing from Murat’s words that he would very soon<br>be brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at the next<br>village the sentinels of Davout’s infantry corps detained him as<br>the pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the corps<br>commander, who was fetched, conducted him into the village to Marshal<br>Davout.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>Davout was to Napoleon what Arakchéev was to Alexander—though not a<br>coward like Arakchéev, he was as precise, as cruel, and as unable to<br>express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty.<br><br>In the organism of states such men are necessary, as wolves are<br>necessary in the organism of nature, and they always exist, always<br>appear and hold their own, however incongruous their presence and their<br>proximity to the head of the government may be. This inevitability alone<br>can explain how the cruel Arakchéev, who tore out a grenadier’s mustache<br>with his own hands, whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face<br>danger, and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier, was able to<br>maintain his powerful position with Alexander, whose own character was<br>chivalrous, noble, and gentle.<br><br>Balashëv found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasant’s hut,<br>writing—he was auditing accounts. Better quarters could have been<br>found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who purposely put<br>themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for<br>being gloomy. For the same reason they are always hard at work and in a<br>hurry. “How can I think of the bright side of life when, as you see, I<br>am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed?” the expression of<br>his face seemed to say. The chief pleasure and necessity of such men,<br>when they encounter anyone who shows animation, is to flaunt their own<br>dreary, persistent activity. Davout allowed himself that pleasure when<br>Balashëv was brought in. He became still more absorbed in his task when<br>the Russian general entered, and after glancing over his spectacles at<br>Balashëv’s face, which was animated by the beauty of the morning and<br>by his talk with Murat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still<br>more and sneered malevolently.<br><br>When he noticed in Balashëv’s face the disagreeable impression this<br>reception produced, Davout raised his head and coldly asked what he<br>wanted.<br><br>Thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because<br>Davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the Emperor<br>Alexander and even his envoy to Napoleon, Balashëv hastened to inform<br>him of his rank and mission. Contrary to his expectation, Davout, after<br>hearing him, became still surlier and ruder.<br><br>“Where is your dispatch?” he inquired. “Give it to me. I will send it to<br>the Emperor.”<br><br>Balashëv replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the<br>Emperor.<br><br>“Your Emperor’s orders are obeyed in your army, but here,” said Davout,<br>“you must do as you’re told.”<br><br>And, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his<br>dependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer<br>on duty.<br><br>Balashëv took out the packet containing the Emperor’s letter and laid it<br>on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it, laid<br>across two barrels). Davout took the packet and read the inscription.<br><br>“You are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not,”<br>protested Balashëv, “but permit me to observe that I have the honor to<br>be adjutant general to His Majesty....”<br><br>Davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the<br>signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on Balashëv’s face.<br><br>“You will be treated as is fitting,” said he and, putting the packet in<br>his pocket, left the shed.<br><br>A minute later the marshal’s adjutant, de Castrès, came in and conducted<br>Balashëv to the quarters assigned him.<br><br>That day he dined with the marshal, at the same board on the barrels.<br><br>Next day Davout rode out early and, after asking Balashëv to come to<br>him, peremptorily requested him to remain there, to move on with the<br>baggage train should orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one<br>except Monsieur de Castrès.<br><br>After four days of solitude, ennui, and consciousness of his impotence<br>and insignificance—particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of<br>power in which he had so lately moved—and after several marches with<br>the marshal’s baggage and the French army, which occupied the<br>whole district, Balashëv was brought to Vílna—now occupied by the<br>French—through the very gate by which he had left it four days<br>previously.<br><br>Next day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne, came<br>to Balashëv and informed him of the Emperor Napoleon’s wish to honor him<br>with an audience.<br><br>Four days before, sentinels of the Preobrazhénsk regiment had stood in<br>front of the house to which Balashëv was conducted, and now two French<br>grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with<br>shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a<br>brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting<br>for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle<br>horse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received Balashëv in the very<br>house in Vílna from which Alexander had dispatched him on his mission.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>Though Balashëv was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the luxury<br>and magnificence of Napoleon’s court.<br><br>The Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many<br>generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates—several of whom<br>Balashëv had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia—were waiting.<br>Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before going<br>for his ride.<br><br>After some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into<br>the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked Balashëv to follow<br>him.<br><br>Balashëv went into a small reception room, one door of which led into a<br>study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him<br>on his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. He heard hurried<br>footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened rapidly; all<br>was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps,<br>firm and resolute—they were those of Napoleon. He had just finished<br>dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform, opening in front over<br>a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach, white<br>leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs, and<br>Hessian boots. His short hair had evidently just been brushed, but one<br>lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead. His plump white neck<br>stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he smelled<br>of Eau de Cologne. His full face, rather young-looking, with its<br>prominent chin, wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial<br>welcome.<br><br>He entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head slightly<br>thrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad thick<br>shoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, had that<br>imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in<br>comfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spirits that<br>day.<br><br>He nodded in answer to Balashëv’s low and respectful bow, and coming up<br>to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his<br>time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure<br>he will always say the right thing and say it well.<br><br>“Good day, General!” said he. “I have received the letter you brought<br>from the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you.” He glanced with<br>his large eyes into Balashëv’s face and immediately looked past him.<br><br>It was plain that Balashëv’s personality did not interest him at all.<br>Evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him.<br>Nothing outside himself had any significance for him, because everything<br>in the world, it seemed to him, depended entirely on his will.<br><br>“I do not, and did not, desire war,” he continued, “but it has been<br>forced on me. Even now” (he emphasized the word) “I am ready to receive<br>any explanations you can give me.”<br><br>And he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for<br>dissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the calmly<br>moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, Balashëv<br>was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into<br>negotiations.<br><br>When Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the<br>Russian envoy, Balashëv began a speech he had prepared long before:<br>“Sire! The Emperor, my master...” but the sight of the Emperor’s eyes<br>bent on him confused him. “You are flurried—compose yourself!” Napoleon<br>seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at<br>Balashëv’s uniform and sword.<br><br>Balashëv recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the<br>Emperor Alexander did not consider Kurákin’s demand for his passports a<br>sufficient cause for war; that Kurákin had acted on his own initiative<br>and without his sovereign’s assent, that the Emperor Alexander did not<br>desire war, and had no relations with England.<br><br>“Not yet!” interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to his<br>feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that Balashëv might<br>proceed.<br><br>After saying all he had been instructed to say, Balashëv added that<br>the Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter into<br>negotiations except on condition that... Here Balashëv hesitated:<br>he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his<br>letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltykóv and had<br>told Balashëv to repeat to Napoleon. Balashëv remembered these words,<br>“So long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil,” but some<br>complex feeling restrained him. He could not utter them, though he<br>wished to do so. He grew confused and said: “On condition that the<br>French army retires beyond the Niemen.”<br><br>Napoleon noticed Balashëv’s embarrassment when uttering these last<br>words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver<br>rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began speaking in<br>a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the speech that<br>followed, Balashëv, who more than once lowered his eyes, involuntarily<br>noticed the quivering of Napoleon’s left leg which increased the more<br>Napoleon raised his voice.<br><br>“I desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,” he began. “Have<br>I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it? I<br>have waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to begin<br>negotiations, what is demanded of me?” he said, frowning and making an<br>energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand.<br><br>“The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,” replied Balashëv.<br><br>“The Niemen?” repeated Napoleon. “So now you want me to retire beyond<br>the Niemen—only the Niemen?” repeated Napoleon, looking straight at<br>Balashëv.<br><br>The latter bowed his head respectfully.<br><br>Instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from Pomerania,<br>only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded. Napoleon turned<br>quickly and began to pace the room.<br><br>“You say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen<br>before commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months ago<br>the demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the Oder,<br>and yet you are willing to negotiate.”<br><br>He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again<br>stopped in front of Balashëv. Balashëv noticed that his left leg was<br>quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern<br>expression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon was<br>conscious of. “The vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me,”<br>he remarked at a later date.<br><br>“Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be made to a<br>Prince of Baden, but not to me!” Napoleon almost screamed, quite to his<br>own surprise. “If you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept<br>such conditions. You say I have begun this war! But who first joined his<br>army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I<br>have expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when<br>your position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But what is the<br>aim of your alliance with England? What has she given you?” he continued<br>hurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace<br>and discuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and<br>power and Alexander’s errors and duplicity.<br><br>The commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the<br>intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing<br>that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had begun talking,<br>and the more he talked the less could he control his words.<br><br>The whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and<br>insult Alexander—just what he had least desired at the commencement of<br>the interview.<br><br>“I hear you have made peace with Turkey?”<br><br>Balashëv bowed his head affirmatively.<br><br>“Peace has been concluded...” he began.<br><br>But Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all the<br>talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and<br>unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone.<br><br>“Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining<br>Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those<br>provinces as I gave him Finland. Yes,” he went on, “I promised and would<br>have given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now he<br>won’t have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united them to<br>his empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia from the<br>Gulf of Bothnia to the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the Great could<br>not have done more,” said Napoleon, growing more and more excited as he<br>paced up and down the room, repeating to Balashëv almost the very words<br>he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. “All that, he would have<br>owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!” he repeated several<br>times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it to<br>his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.<br><br>“What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander’s might have been!”<br><br>He looked compassionately at Balashëv, and as soon as the latter tried<br>to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.<br><br>“What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained<br>through my friendship?” demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders<br>in perplexity. “But no, he has preferred to surround himself with<br>my enemies, and with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and<br>Wintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor expelled from his own country;<br>Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugitive French<br>subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but all<br>the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who<br>should awaken terrible memories in the Emperor Alexander’s mind....<br>Granted that were they competent they might be made use of,” continued<br>Napoleon—hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts<br>that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and strong he was (in his<br>perception the two were one and the same)—“but they are not even that!<br>They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to be the<br>most capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by his first<br>movements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel proposes,<br>Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called on to act,<br>does not know what to decide on, and time passes bringing no result.<br>Bagratión alone is a military man. He’s stupid, but he has experience,<br>a quick eye, and resolution.... And what role is your young monarch<br>playing in that monstrous crowd? They compromise him and throw on him<br>the responsibility for all that happens. A sovereign should not be with<br>the army unless he is a general!” said Napoleon, evidently uttering<br>these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander<br>desired to be a military commander.<br><br>“The campaign began only a week ago, and you haven’t even been able to<br>defend Vílna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of the Polish<br>provinces. Your army is grumbling.”<br><br>“On the contrary, Your Majesty,” said Balashëv, hardly able to remember<br>what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with<br>difficulty, “the troops are burning with eagerness...”<br><br>“I know everything!” Napoleon interrupted him. “I know everything. I<br>know the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You have<br>not two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number. I give<br>you my word of honor,” said Napoleon, forgetting that his word of honor<br>could carry no weight—“I give you my word of honor that I have five<br>hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula. The Turks will<br>be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making<br>peace with you. As for the Swedes—it is their fate to be governed by<br>mad kings. Their king was insane and they changed him for<br>another—Bernadotte, who promptly went mad—for no Swede would ally<br>himself with Russia unless he were mad.”<br><br>Napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose.<br><br>Balashëv knew how to reply to each of Napoleon’s remarks, and would<br>have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say<br>something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the alleged insanity<br>of the Swedes, Balashëv wished to reply that when Russia is on her side<br>Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation<br>to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which<br>a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is<br>in the right. Balashëv began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared<br>to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man,<br>he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently<br>seized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon<br>had any significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them<br>when he came to his senses. Balashëv stood with downcast eyes, looking<br>at the movements of Napoleon’s stout legs and trying to avoid meeting<br>his eyes.<br><br>“But what do I care about your allies?” said Napoleon. “I have<br>allies—the Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight like<br>lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.”<br><br>And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this<br>obvious falsehood, and that Balashëv still stood silently before him in<br>the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon abruptly turned<br>round, drew close to Balashëv’s face, and, gesticulating rapidly and<br>energetically with his white hands, almost shouted:<br><br>“Know that if you stir up Prussia against me, I’ll wipe it off the map<br>of Europe!” he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and he<br>struck one of his small hands energetically with the other. “Yes, I<br>will throw you back beyond the Dvína and beyond the Dnieper, and will<br>re-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of<br>Europe to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to you.<br>That is what you have gained by alienating me!” And he walked silently<br>several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders twitching.<br><br>He put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again, lifted<br>it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of Balashëv. He<br>paused, looked ironically straight into Balashëv’s eyes, and said in a<br>quiet voice:<br><br>“And yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!”<br><br>Balashëv, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the<br>Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon was<br>silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to<br>him. Balashëv said that in Russia the best results were expected from<br>the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to say, “I know it’s<br>your duty to say that, but you don’t believe it yourself. I have<br>convinced you.”<br><br>When Balashëv had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, sniffed<br>at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal. The door<br>opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully, handed the Emperor<br>his hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket handkerchief. Napoleon,<br>without giving them a glance, turned to Balashëv:<br><br>“Assure the Emperor Alexander from me,” said he, taking his hat, “that<br>I am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very highly<br>esteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer, General; you<br>shall receive my letter to the Emperor.”<br><br>And Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception room<br>rushed forward and descended the staircase.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>After all that Napoleon had said to him—those bursts of anger and the<br>last dryly spoken words: “I will detain you no longer, General; you<br>shall receive my letter,” Balashëv felt convinced that Napoleon would<br>not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with him—an<br>insulted envoy—especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger. But,<br>to his surprise, Balashëv received, through Duroc, an invitation to dine<br>with the Emperor that day.<br><br>Bessières, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.<br><br>Napoleon met Balashëv cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed no sign<br>of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning,<br>but, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balashëv. It was evident that<br>he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a<br>mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was right, not<br>because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but because he<br>did it.<br><br>The Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through Vílna, where<br>crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him. From all<br>the windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs, flags, and his<br>monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies, welcoming him, waved<br>their handkerchiefs to him.<br><br>At dinner, having placed Balashëv beside him, Napoleon not only treated<br>him amiably but behaved as if Balashëv were one of his own courtiers,<br>one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at<br>his success. In the course of conversation he mentioned Moscow and<br>questioned Balashëv about the Russian capital, not merely as an<br>interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit, but as<br>if convinced that Balashëv, as a Russian, must be flattered by his<br>curiosity.<br><br>“How many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it true<br>that Moscow is called ‘Holy Moscow’? How many churches are there in<br>Moscow?” he asked.<br><br>And receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches,<br>he remarked:<br><br>“Why such a quantity of churches?”<br><br>“The Russians are very devout,” replied Balashëv.<br><br>“But a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the<br>backwardness of a people,” said Napoleon, turning to Caulaincourt for<br>appreciation of this remark.<br><br>Balashëv respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.<br><br>“Every country has its own character,” said he.<br><br>“But nowhere in Europe is there anything like that,” said Napoleon.<br><br>“I beg your Majesty’s pardon,” returned Balashëv, “besides Russia there<br>is Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.”<br><br>This reply of Balashëv’s, which hinted at the recent defeats of the<br>French in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at Alexander’s<br>court, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleon’s dinner, where it<br>passed unnoticed.<br><br>The uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they<br>were puzzled as to what Balashëv’s tone suggested. “If there is a point<br>we don’t see it, or it is not at all witty,” their expressions seemed<br>to say. So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not<br>notice it at all and naïvely asked Balashëv through what towns the<br>direct road from there to Moscow passed. Balashëv, who was on the alert<br>all through the dinner, replied that just as “all roads lead to Rome,”<br>so all roads lead to Moscow: there were many roads, and “among them the<br>road through Poltáva, which Charles XII chose.” Balashëv involuntarily<br>flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply, but hardly had<br>he uttered the word Poltáva before Caulaincourt began speaking of the<br>badness of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and of his Petersburg<br>reminiscences.<br><br>After dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon’s study, which four<br>days previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander. Napoleon sat<br>down, toying with his Sèvres coffee cup, and motioned Balashëv to a<br>chair beside him.<br><br>Napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than<br>any reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to<br>consider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was surrounded<br>by men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after his dinner,<br>Balashëv too was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned to him with a<br>pleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.<br><br>“They tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied? Strange,<br>isn’t it, General?” he said, evidently not doubting that this remark<br>would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his, Napoleon’s,<br>superiority to Alexander.<br><br>Balashëv made no reply and bowed his head in silence.<br><br>“Yes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were<br>deliberating,” continued Napoleon with the same derisive and<br>self-confident smile. “What I can’t understand,” he went on, “is that<br>the Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies.<br>That I do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may do the same?”<br>and he turned inquiringly to Balashëv, and evidently this thought turned<br>him back on to the track of his morning’s anger, which was still fresh<br>in him.<br><br>“And let him know that I will do so!” said Napoleon, rising and pushing<br>his cup away with his hand. “I’ll drive all his Württemberg, Baden, and<br>Weimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. I’ll drive them out. Let him<br>prepare an asylum for them in Russia!”<br><br>Balashëv bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to<br>make his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help<br>hearing what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression;<br>he treated Balashëv not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man<br>now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master’s<br>humiliation.<br><br>“And why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies? What is<br>the good of that? War is my profession, but his business is to reign<br>and not to command armies! Why has he taken on himself such a<br>responsibility?”<br><br>Again Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up and down<br>the room in silence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly, went up to<br>Balashëv and with a slight smile, as confidently, quickly, and simply<br>as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to<br>Balashëv, he raised his hand to the forty-year-old Russian general’s<br>face and, taking him by the ear, pulled it gently, smiling with his lips<br>only.<br><br>To have one’s ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest<br>honor and mark of favor at the French court.<br><br>“Well, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why don’t you say<br>anything?” said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to be the<br>adorer and courtier of anyone but himself, Napoleon. “Are the horses<br>ready for the general?” he added, with a slight inclination of his head<br>in reply to Balashëv’s bow. “Let him have mine, he has a long way to<br>go!”<br><br>The letter taken by Balashëv was the last Napoleon sent to Alexander.<br>Every detail of the interview was communicated to the Russian monarch,<br>and the war began....<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>After his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to<br>Petersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to meet<br>Anatole Kurágin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On reaching<br>Petersburg he inquired for Kurágin but the latter had already left the<br>city. Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on<br>his track. Anatole Kurágin promptly obtained an appointment from<br>the Minister of War and went to join the army in Moldavia. While in<br>Petersburg Prince Andrew met Kutúzov, his former commander who was<br>always well disposed toward him, and Kutúzov suggested that he should<br>accompany him to the army in Moldavia, to which the old general had<br>been appointed commander in chief. So Prince Andrew, having received an<br>appointment on the headquarters staff, left for Turkey.<br><br>Prince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge Kurágin.<br>He thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might<br>compromise the young Countess Rostóva and so he wanted to meet Kurágin<br>personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel. But he again<br>failed to meet Kurágin in Turkey, for soon after Prince Andrew arrived,<br>the latter returned to Russia. In a new country, amid new conditions,<br>Prince Andrew found life easier to bear. After his betrothed had broken<br>faith with him—which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to<br>conceal its effects—the surroundings in which he had been happy became<br>trying to him, and the freedom and independence he had once prized<br>so highly were still more so. Not only could he no longer think the<br>thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the<br>field of Austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with Pierre, and which<br>had filled his solitude at Boguchárovo and then in Switzerland and Rome,<br>but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons<br>they had revealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical<br>matters unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more<br>eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if<br>that lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him<br>had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down, in<br>which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.<br><br>Of the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was the<br>simplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on Kutúzov’s staff,<br>he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised<br>Kutúzov by his willingness and accuracy in work. Not having found<br>Kurágin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it necessary to rush back<br>to Russia after him, but all the same he knew that however long it might<br>be before he met Kurágin, despite his contempt for him and despite all<br>the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping<br>to a conflict with him—he knew that when he did meet him he would not<br>be able to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help<br>snatching at food. And the consciousness that the insult was not yet<br>avenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his heart and<br>poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in<br>Turkey by means of restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and<br>ambitious activity.<br><br>In the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached<br>Bucharest—where Kutúzov had been living for two months, passing his<br>days and nights with a Wallachian woman—Prince Andrew asked Kutúzov<br>to transfer him to the Western Army. Kutúzov, who was already weary of<br>Bolkónski’s activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very<br>readily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly.<br><br>Before joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at<br>Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way,<br>being only two miles off the Smolénsk highroad. During the last three<br>years there had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt,<br>and seen so much (having traveled both in the east and the west), that<br>on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find<br>the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail.<br>He entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up<br>the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted,<br>sleeping castle. The same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the<br>same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture,<br>the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only<br>somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the same timid, plain maiden<br>getting on in years, uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of<br>her life in fear and constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was<br>the same coquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her<br>existence and full of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become<br>more self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had<br>brought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and<br>talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same narrowly<br>intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old prince<br>had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which left a<br>noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was the same as<br>ever, only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was<br>happening in the world. Little Nicholas alone had changed. He had grown,<br>become rosier, had curly dark hair, and, when merry and laughing, quite<br>unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just<br>as the little princess used to do. He alone did not obey the law of<br>immutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle. But though externally<br>all remained as of old, the inner relations of all these people had<br>changed since Prince Andrew had seen them last. The household was<br>divided into two alien and hostile camps, who changed their habits for<br>his sake and only met because he was there. To the one camp belonged<br>the old prince, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other<br>Princess Mary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and<br>maids.<br><br>During his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but they<br>were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose<br>sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all<br>feel awkward. Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day, he<br>was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb<br>and retired to his apartments directly after dinner. In the evening,<br>when Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse him, began to<br>tell him of the young Count Kámensky’s campaign, the old prince<br>began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for her<br>superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said,<br>was the only person really attached to him.<br><br>The old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of Princess<br>Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and that by<br>indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince Nicholas. The<br>old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her<br>life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not help tormenting<br>her and that she deserved it. “Why does Prince Andrew, who sees this,<br>say nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me a scoundrel, or an<br>old fool who, without any reason, keeps his own daughter at a distance<br>and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He doesn’t understand, so I<br>must explain it, and he must hear me out,” thought the old prince.<br>And he began explaining why he could not put up with his daughter’s<br>unreasonable character.<br><br>“If you ask me,” said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was<br>censuring his father for the first time in his life), “I did not wish to<br>speak about it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank opinion. If<br>there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and Mary, I can’t<br>blame her for it at all. I know how she loves and respects you. Since<br>you ask me,” continued Prince Andrew, becoming irritable—as he was<br>always liable to do of late—“I can only say that if there are any<br>misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman, who is not<br>fit to be my sister’s companion.”<br><br>The old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural smile<br>disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince Andrew could<br>not get accustomed.<br><br>“What companion, my dear boy? Eh? You’ve already been talking it over!<br>Eh?”<br><br>“Father, I did not want to judge,” said Prince Andrew, in a hard and<br>bitter tone, “but you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall<br>say, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blame—the one to blame—is<br>that Frenchwoman.”<br><br>“Ah, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!” said the old man in a<br>low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embarrassment,<br>but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: “Be off, be off! Let not a<br>trace of you remain here!...”<br><br><br>Prince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded him<br>to stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did not<br>leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne and<br>Tíkhon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. Next day,<br>before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his son’s rooms. The boy,<br>curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee,<br>and Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell<br>into a reverie without finishing the story. He thought not of this<br>pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. He<br>sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret<br>at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him,<br>and was horrified to find neither. What meant still more to him was that<br>he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son<br>which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on<br>his knee.<br><br>“Well, go on!” said his son.<br><br>Prince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went out<br>of the room.<br><br>As soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and<br>especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had<br>been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity,<br>and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as<br>soon as possible.<br><br>“So you’ve decided to go, Andrew?” asked his sister.<br><br>“Thank God that I can,” replied Prince Andrew. “I am very sorry you<br>can’t.”<br><br>“Why do you say that?” replied Princess Mary. “Why do you say that,<br>when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne says he has been asking about you....”<br><br>As soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears<br>began to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the room.<br><br>“Ah, my God! my God! When one thinks who and what—what trash—can cause<br>people misery!” he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess Mary.<br><br>She understood that when speaking of “trash” he referred not only to<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man who<br>had ruined his own happiness.<br><br>“Andrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!” she said, touching his<br>elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears. “I<br>understand you” (she looked down). “Don’t imagine that sorrow is the<br>work of men. Men are His tools.” She looked a little above Prince<br>Andrew’s head with the confident, accustomed look with which one looks<br>at the place where a familiar portrait hangs. “Sorrow is sent by Him,<br>not by men. Men are His instruments, they are not to blame. If you think<br>someone has wronged you, forget it and forgive! We have no right to<br>punish. And then you will know the happiness of forgiving.”<br><br>“If I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a woman’s virtue. But<br>a man should not and cannot forgive and forget,” he replied, and though<br>till that moment he had not been thinking of Kurágin, all his unexpended<br>anger suddenly swelled up in his heart.<br><br>“If Mary is already persuading me to forgive, it means that I ought long<br>ago to have punished him,” he thought. And giving her no further reply,<br>he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet<br>Kurágin who he knew was now in the army.<br><br>Princess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she knew how<br>unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being reconciled to<br>him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again<br>from the army and would certainly write to his father, but that the<br>longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become.<br><br>“Good-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from God, and men are<br>never to blame,” were the last words he heard from his sister when he<br>took leave of her.<br><br>“Then it must be so!” thought Prince Andrew as he drove out of the<br>avenue from the house at Bald Hills. “She, poor innocent creature, is<br>left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits. The old<br>man feels he is guilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is growing up<br>and rejoices in life, in which like everybody else he will deceive or be<br>deceived. And I am off to the army. Why? I myself don’t know. I want<br>to meet that man whom I despise, so as to give him a chance to kill and<br>laugh at me!”<br><br>These conditions of life had been the same before, but then they were<br>all connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only senseless<br>things, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after another to<br>Prince Andrew’s mind.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>Prince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of<br>June. The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied the fortified<br>camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying to effect a<br>junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by<br>large French forces. Everyone was dissatisfied with the general course<br>of affairs in the Russian army, but no one anticipated any danger of<br>invasion of the Russian provinces, and no one thought the war would<br>extend farther than the western, the Polish, provinces.<br><br>Prince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on<br>the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large<br>village in the vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals and<br>courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the<br>villages on both sides of the river, over a radius of six miles. Barclay<br>de Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. He received<br>Bolkónski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he<br>would mention him to the Emperor for a decision as to his employment,<br>but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff. Anatole Kurágin, whom<br>Prince Andrew had hoped to find with the army, was not there. He had<br>gone to Petersburg, but Prince Andrew was glad to hear this. His mind<br>was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting<br>a gigantic war, and he was glad to be free for a while from the<br>distraction caused by the thought of Kurágin. During the first four<br>days, while no duties were required of him, Prince Andrew rode round the<br>whole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own knowledge and by<br>talks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion about it. But the<br>question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained<br>for him undecided. Already from his military experience and what he had<br>seen in the Austrian campaign, he had come to the conclusion that in<br>war the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all<br>depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemy—that cannot be<br>foreseen—are met, and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled.<br>To clear up this last point for himself, Prince Andrew, utilizing his<br>position and acquaintances, tried to fathom the character of the control<br>of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it, and he deduced for<br>himself the following of the state of affairs.<br><br>While the Emperor had still been at Vílna, the forces had been divided<br>into three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the<br>army under Bagratión, and thirdly, the one commanded by Tormásov. The<br>Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander in chief. In the<br>orders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor would take command,<br>but only that he would be with the army. The Emperor, moreover, had<br>with him not a commander in chief’s staff but the imperial headquarters<br>staff. In attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff,<br>Quartermaster General Prince Volkónski, as well as generals, imperial<br>aides-de-camp, diplomatic officials, and a large number of foreigners,<br>but not the army staff. Besides these, there were in attendance on the<br>Emperor without any definite appointments: Arakchéev, the ex-Minister<br>of War; Count Bennigsen, the senior general in rank; the Grand Duke<br>Tsarévich Constantine Pávlovich; Count Rumyántsev, the Chancellor;<br>Stein, a former Prussian minister; Armfeldt, a Swedish general; Pfuel,<br>the chief author of the plan of campaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general<br>and Sardinian émigré; Wolzogen—and many others. Though these men had no<br>military appointment in the army, their position gave them influence,<br>and often a corps commander, or even the commander in chief, did not<br>know in what capacity he was questioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke,<br>Arakchéev, or Prince Volkónski, or was given this or that advice and did<br>not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated<br>from the man who gave it or from the Emperor and whether it had to be<br>executed or not. But this was only the external condition; the essential<br>significance of the presence of the Emperor and of all these people,<br>from a courtier’s point of view (and in an Emperor’s vicinity all became<br>courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this: the Emperor did not<br>assume the title of commander in chief, but disposed of all the armies;<br>the men around him were his assistants. Arakchéev was a faithful<br>custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereign’s bodyguard.<br>Bennigsen was a landlord in the Vílna province who appeared to be doing<br>the honors of the district, but was in reality a good general, useful<br>as an adviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke<br>was there because it suited him to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there<br>because his advice was useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high<br>esteem personally. Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general<br>full of self-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander.<br>Paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech. The<br>adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the<br>Emperor, and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up<br>the plan of campaign against Napoleon and, having induced Alexander to<br>believe in the efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole business<br>of the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuel’s thoughts in<br>a more comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a harsh, bookish<br>theorist, self-confident to the point of despising everyone else) was<br>able to do.<br><br>Besides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected<br>ideas every day—especially the foreigners, who did so with a boldness<br>characteristic of people employed in a country not their own—there were<br>many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals<br>were there.<br><br>Among the opinions and voices in this immense, restless, brilliant,<br>and proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following sharply defined<br>subdivisions of tendencies and parties:<br><br>The first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherents—military theorists<br>who believed in a science of war with immutable laws—laws of oblique<br>movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his adherents demanded<br>a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise<br>laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and they saw only barbarism,<br>ignorance, or evil intention in every deviation from that theory. To<br>this party belonged the foreign nobles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and<br>others, chiefly Germans.<br><br>The second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as<br>always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The members of<br>this party were those who had demanded an advance from Vílna into Poland<br>and freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides being advocates of bold<br>action, this section also represented nationalism, which made them still<br>more one-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: Bagratión, Ermólov<br>(who was beginning to come to the front), and others. At that time a<br>famous joke of Ermólov’s was being circulated, that as a great favor he<br>had petitioned the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party,<br>remembering Suvórov, said that what one had to do was not to reason,<br>or stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of<br>Russia, and not let the army get discouraged.<br><br>To the third party—in which the Emperor had most confidence—belonged the<br>courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two. The<br>members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakchéev belonged,<br>thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to<br>have some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war, particularly<br>against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now),<br>needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and<br>in that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time it had to be<br>acknowledged that the theorists are often one-sided, and therefore one<br>should not trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel’s<br>opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, and<br>then choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention of the camp<br>at Drissa, according to Pfuel’s plan, but on changing the movements of<br>the other armies. Though, by this course, neither one aim nor the other<br>could be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third<br>party.<br><br>Of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the<br>Tsarévich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz, where<br>he had ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and cavalry<br>uniform as to a review, expecting to crush the French gallantly; but<br>unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid<br>the general confusion. The men of this party had both the quality<br>and the defect of frankness in their opinions. They feared Napoleon,<br>recognized his strength and their own weakness, and frankly said so.<br>They said: “Nothing but sorrow, shame, and ruin will come of all this!<br>We have abandoned Vílna and Vítebsk and shall abandon Drissa. The only<br>reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible,<br>before we are turned out of Petersburg.”<br><br>This view was very general in the upper army circles and found support<br>also in Petersburg and from the chancellor, Rumyántsev, who, for other<br>reasons of state, was in favor of peace.<br><br>The fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay de<br>Tolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in<br>chief. “Be he what he may” (they always began like that), “he is an<br>honest, practical man and we have nobody better. Give him real power,<br>for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command, and<br>he will show what he can do, as he did in Finland. If our army is well<br>organized and strong and has withdrawn to Drissa without suffering<br>any defeats, we owe this entirely to Barclay. If Barclay is now to<br>be superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen showed his<br>incapacity already in 1807.”<br><br>The sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at any<br>rate there was no one more active and experienced than Bennigsen: “and<br>twist about as you may, you will have to come to Bennigsen eventually.<br>Let the others make mistakes now!” said they, arguing that our<br>retirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series<br>of blunders. “The more mistakes that are made the better. It will at any<br>rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this.<br>What is wanted is not some Barclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen,<br>who made his mark in 1807, and to whom Napoleon himself did justice—a<br>man whose authority would be willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the<br>only such man.”<br><br>The seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to<br>be found, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there were<br>particularly many round Alexander—generals and imperial aides-de-camp<br>passionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a monarch but as a<br>man, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as Rostóv had done<br>in 1805, and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human<br>capabilities as well. These men, though enchanted with the sovereign<br>for refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for such excessive<br>modesty, and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign<br>should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place<br>himself at the head of the army, gather round him a commander in chief’s<br>staff, and, consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where<br>necessary, would himself lead the troops, whose spirits would thereby be<br>raised to the highest pitch.<br><br>The eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to the<br>others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither<br>peace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa<br>or anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor<br>Bennigsen, but only the one most essential thing—as much advantage<br>and pleasure for themselves as possible. In the troubled waters of<br>conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperor’s<br>headquarters, it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at<br>other times. A man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would<br>today agree with Pfuel, tomorrow with his opponent, and the day after,<br>merely to avoid responsibility or to please the Emperor, would declare<br>that he had no opinion at all on the matter. Another who wished to<br>gain some advantage would attract the Emperor’s attention by loudly<br>advocating the very thing the Emperor had hinted at the day before,<br>and would dispute and shout at the council, beating his breast and<br>challenging those who did not agree with him to duels, thereby proving<br>that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good. A third,<br>in the absence of opponents, between two councils would simply solicit<br>a special gratuity for his faithful services, well knowing that at that<br>moment people would be too busy to refuse him. A fourth while seemingly<br>overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the Emperor’s<br>eye. A fifth, to achieve his long-cherished aim of dining with the<br>Emperor, would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some<br>newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more<br>or less forcible and correct.<br><br>All the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations, and<br>promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial<br>favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction, this whole<br>drone population of the army began blowing hard that way, so that it<br>was all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere. Amid the<br>uncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious danger giving<br>a peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid this vortex of<br>intrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings, and the diversity<br>of race among these people—this eighth and largest party of those<br>preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and<br>obscurity to the common task. Whatever question arose, a swarm of these<br>drones, without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme, flew<br>over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of<br>those who were disputing honestly.<br><br>From among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached<br>the army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning<br>to raise its voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men<br>experienced and capable in state affairs, who, without sharing any of<br>those conflicting opinions, were able to take a detached view of what<br>was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of<br>escape from this muddle, indecision, intricacy, and weakness.<br><br>The men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted<br>chiefly from the Emperor’s presence in the army with his military court<br>and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional,<br>and unsteady fluctuation of relations, which is in place at court but<br>harmful in an army; that a sovereign should reign but not command the<br>army, and that the only way out of the position would be for the Emperor<br>and his court to leave the army; that the mere presence of the Emperor<br>paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his<br>personal safety, and that the worst commander in chief, if independent,<br>would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and<br>authority of the monarch.<br><br>Just at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa,<br>Shishkóv, the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives of<br>this party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which Arakchéev and Balashëv<br>agreed to sign. In this letter, availing himself of permission given him<br>by the Emperor to discuss the general course of affairs, he respectfully<br>suggested—on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse<br>a warlike spirit in the people of the capital—that the Emperor should<br>leave the army.<br><br>That arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to<br>defend their country—the very incitement which was the chief cause of<br>Russia’s triumph in so far as it was produced by the Tsar’s personal<br>presence in Moscow—was suggested to the Emperor, and accepted by him, as<br>a pretext for quitting the army.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>This letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when Barclay, one<br>day at dinner, informed Bolkónski that the sovereign wished to see him<br>personally, to question him about Turkey, and that Prince Andrew was to<br>present himself at Bennigsen’s quarters at six that evening.<br><br>News was received at the Emperor’s quarters that very day of a fresh<br>movement by Napoleon which might endanger the army—news subsequently<br>found to be false. And that morning Colonel Michaud had ridden round the<br>Drissa fortifications with the Emperor and had pointed out to him that<br>this fortified camp constructed by Pfuel, and till then considered<br>a chef-d’oeuvre of tactical science which would ensure Napoleon’s<br>destruction, was an absurdity, threatening the destruction of the<br>Russian army.<br><br>Prince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen’s quarters—a country gentleman’s<br>house of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river. Neither<br>Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but Chernýshev, the Emperor’s<br>aide-de-camp, received Bolkónski and informed him that the Emperor,<br>accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had gone a second<br>time that day to inspect the fortifications of the Drissa camp, of the<br>suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt.<br><br>Chernýshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French novel<br>in his hand. This room had probably been a music room; there was still<br>an organ in it on which some rugs were piled, and in one corner stood<br>the folding bedstead of Bennigsen’s adjutant. This adjutant was also<br>there and sat dozing on the rolled-up bedding, evidently exhausted by<br>work or by feasting. Two doors led from the room, one straight on into<br>what had been the drawing room, and another, on the right, to the study.<br>Through the first door came the sound of voices conversing in German<br>and occasionally in French. In that drawing room were gathered, by<br>the Emperor’s wish, not a military council (the Emperor preferred<br>indefiniteness), but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in<br>view of the impending difficulties. It was not a council of war, but,<br>as it were, a council to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor<br>personally. To this semicouncil had been invited the Swedish General<br>Armfeldt, Adjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode (whom Napoleon had<br>referred to as a renegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, Count Stein<br>who was not a military man at all, and Pfuel himself, who, as Prince<br>Andrew had heard, was the mainspring of the whole affair. Prince Andrew<br>had an opportunity of getting a good look at him, for Pfuel arrived soon<br>after himself and, in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a<br>minute to speak to Chernýshev.<br><br>At first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian general,<br>which fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince<br>Andrew, though he saw him now for the first time. There was about<br>him something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German<br>theorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more<br>typical than any of them. Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German<br>theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to<br>such an extent.<br><br>Pfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust build,<br>broad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His face was<br>much wrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had evidently been hastily<br>brushed smooth in front of the temples, but stuck up behind in quaint<br>little tufts. He entered the room, looking restlessly and angrily<br>around, as if afraid of everything in that large apartment. Awkwardly<br>holding up his sword, he addressed Chernýshev and asked in German where<br>the Emperor was. One could see that he wished to pass through the rooms<br>as quickly as possible, finish with the bows and greetings, and sit down<br>to business in front of a map, where he would feel at home. He nodded<br>hurriedly in reply to Chernýshev, and smiled ironically on hearing that<br>the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he, Pfuel, had<br>planned in accord with his theory. He muttered something to himself<br>abruptly and in a bass voice, as self-assured Germans do—it might<br>have been “stupid fellow”... or “the whole affair will be ruined,” or<br>“something absurd will come of it.”... Prince Andrew did not catch<br>what he said and would have passed on, but Chernýshev introduced him to<br>Pfuel, remarking that Prince Andrew was just back from Turkey where the<br>war had terminated so fortunately. Pfuel barely glanced—not so much at<br>Prince Andrew as past him—and said, with a laugh: “That must have been a<br>fine tactical war”; and, laughing contemptuously, went on into the room<br>from which the sound of voices was heard.<br><br>Pfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly<br>disturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect<br>and criticize his camp in his absence. From this short interview with<br>Pfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to<br>form a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly<br>and immutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of<br>martyrdom as only Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident<br>on the basis of an abstract notion—science, that is, the supposed<br>knowledge of absolute truth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he<br>regards himself personally, both in mind and body, as irresistibly<br>attractive to men and women. An Englishman is self-assured, as being a<br>citizen of the best-organized state in the world, and therefore as an<br>Englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as<br>an Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because<br>he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian<br>is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know<br>anything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The<br>German’s self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more<br>repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the<br>truth—science—which he himself has invented but which is for him the<br>absolute truth.<br><br>Pfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science—the theory of oblique<br>movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the Great’s wars,<br>and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to<br>him absurd and barbarous—monstrous collisions in which so many blunders<br>were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars,<br>they did not accord with the theory, and therefore could not serve as<br>material for science.<br><br>In 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of<br>campaign that ended in Jena and Auerstädt, but he did not see the least<br>proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war. On<br>the contrary, the deviations made from his theory were, in his opinion,<br>the sole cause of the whole disaster, and with characteristically<br>gleeful sarcasm he would remark, “There, I said the whole affair would<br>go to the devil!” Pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love<br>their theory that they lose sight of the theory’s object—its practical<br>application. His love of theory made him hate everything practical, and<br>he would not listen to it. He was even pleased by failures, for failures<br>resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him<br>the accuracy of his theory.<br><br>He said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chernýshev about the present<br>war, with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong,<br>and who is not displeased that it should be so. The unbrushed tufts<br>of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples<br>expressed this most eloquently.<br><br>He passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of his<br>voice were at once heard from there.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>Prince Andrew’s eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when<br>Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolkónski, but not<br>pausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he<br>went. The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened on<br>to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign.<br>Chernýshev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the Emperor,<br>who looked fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was talking to<br>him with particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head bent to the<br>left, was listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward<br>evidently wishing to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited<br>Italian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak.<br><br>“And as for the man who advised forming this camp—the Drissa camp,” said<br>Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince Andrew<br>scanned his unfamiliar face, “as to that person, sire...” continued<br>Paulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain himself, “the man<br>who advised the Drissa camp—I see no alternative but the lunatic asylum<br>or the gallows!”<br><br>Without heeding the end of the Italian’s remarks, and as though<br>not hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing Bolkónski, addressed him<br>graciously.<br><br>“I am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are meeting, and wait<br>for me.”<br><br>The Emperor went into the study. He was followed by Prince Peter<br>Mikháylovich Volkónski and Baron Stein, and the door closed behind them.<br>Prince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperor’s permission, accompanied<br>Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing room where the<br>council was assembled.<br><br>Prince Peter Mikháylovich Volkónski occupied the position, as it were,<br>of chief of the Emperor’s staff. He came out of the study into the<br>drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table, and put<br>questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen<br>present. What had happened was that news (which afterwards proved to be<br>false) had been received during the night of a movement by the French to<br>outflank the Drissa camp.<br><br>The first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty that<br>presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position<br>away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this was<br>inexplicable (unless he wished to show that he, too, could have an<br>opinion), but he urged that at this point the army should unite and<br>there await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that<br>plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions<br>put—which, in fact, his plan did not answer—as to avail himself of the<br>opportunity to air it. It was one of the millions of proposals, one as<br>good as another, that could be made as long as it was quite unknown<br>what character the war would take. Some disputed his arguments, others<br>defended them. Young Count Toll objected to the Swedish general’s views<br>more warmly than anyone else, and in the course of the dispute drew from<br>his side pocket a well-filled notebook, which he asked permission to<br>read to them. In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme,<br>totally different from Armfeldt’s or Pfuel’s plan of campaign. In answer<br>to Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack, which, he urged,<br>could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap<br>(as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated.<br><br>During all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen<br>(his “bridge” in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted<br>contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean<br>himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when<br>Prince Volkónski, who was in the chair, called on him to give his<br>opinion, he merely said:<br><br>“Why ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an<br>exposed rear, or why not this Italian gentleman’s attack—very fine, or<br>a retreat, also good! Why ask me?” said he. “Why, you yourselves know<br>everything better than I do.”<br><br>But when Volkónski said, with a frown, that it was in the Emperor’s name<br>that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly growing animated,<br>began to speak:<br><br>“Everything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody thought they<br>knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How mend matters? There<br>is nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me must be strictly<br>adhered to,” said he, drumming on the table with his bony fingers. “What<br>is the difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!”<br><br>He went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no<br>eventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that<br>everything had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really going to<br>outflank it, the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.<br><br>Paulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in French.<br>Wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French badly,<br>and began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with Pfuel, who<br>was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened, but all<br>that could happen, had been foreseen in his scheme, and that if there<br>were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan<br>had not been precisely executed. He kept laughing sarcastically, he<br>demonstrated, and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate, like<br>a mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of<br>a problem that has already been proved. Wolzogen took his place and<br>continued to explain his views in French, every now and then turning to<br>Pfuel and saying, “Is it not so, your excellency?” But Pfuel, like a man<br>heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side, shouted angrily at<br>his own supporter, Wolzogen:<br><br>“Well, of course, what more is there to explain?”<br><br>Paulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in French.<br>Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to Volkónski in<br>Russian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.<br><br>Of all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry,<br>determined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those present,<br>evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself, nursed no<br>hatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan, formed on a<br>theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out. He was<br>ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary<br>respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides this, the remarks<br>of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable<br>at the council of war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleon’s<br>genius, which, though concealed, was noticeable in every rejoinder.<br>Everything was assumed to be possible for Napoleon, they expected him<br>from every side, and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other’s<br>proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to consider Napoleon a barbarian like<br>everyone else who opposed his theory. But besides this feeling of<br>respect, Pfuel evoked pity in Prince Andrew. From the tone in which<br>the courtiers addressed him and the way Paulucci had allowed himself to<br>speak of him to the Emperor, but above all from a certain desperation<br>in Pfuel’s own expressions, it was clear that the others knew, and Pfuel<br>himself felt, that his fall was at hand. And despite his self-confidence<br>and grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair smoothly<br>brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he<br>concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was<br>evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his<br>theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world<br>was slipping away from him.<br><br>The discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted<br>the more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and<br>personalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any general<br>conclusion from all that had been said. Prince Andrew, listening to this<br>polyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, refutations, and shouts,<br>felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying. A thought that had<br>long since and often occurred to him during his military activities—the<br>idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war, and that<br>therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius—now appeared<br>to him an obvious truth. “What theory and science is possible about a<br>matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot<br>be defined, especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be<br>ascertained? No one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or<br>the enemy’s armies will be in a day’s time, and no one can gauge the<br>force of this or that detachment. Sometimes—when there is not a coward<br>at the front to shout, ‘We are cut off!’ and start running, but a brave<br>and jolly lad who shouts, ‘Hurrah!’—a detachment of five thousand<br>is worth thirty thousand, as at Schön Grabern, while at times fifty<br>thousand run from eight thousand, as at Austerlitz. What science can<br>there be in a matter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing<br>can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions, the<br>significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives<br>no one knows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci<br>says we have got the French army between two fires; Michaud says that<br>the worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it,<br>and Pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength; Toll proposes<br>one plan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good and all bad, and the<br>advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial.<br>And why do they all speak of a ‘military genius’? Is a man a genius who<br>can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go<br>to the right and who to the left? It is only because military men are<br>invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power,<br>attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. The best<br>generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded<br>men. Bagratión was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that. And of<br>Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied face on the<br>field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander not need any<br>special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest<br>and best human attributes—love, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic<br>inquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly convinced that what he<br>is doing is very important (otherwise he will not have sufficient<br>patience), and only then will he be a brave leader. God forbid that he<br>should be humane, should love, or pity, or think of what is just<br>and unjust. It is understandable that a theory of their ‘genius’ was<br>invented for them long ago because they have power! The success of a<br>military action depends not on them, but on the man in the ranks who<br>shouts, ‘We are lost!’ or who shouts, ‘Hurrah!’ And only in the ranks<br>can one serve with assurance of being useful.”<br><br>So thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and he roused<br>himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving.<br><br>At the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he would<br>like to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court circles<br>forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereign’s person, but<br>for permission to serve in the army.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>Before the beginning of the campaign, Rostóv had received a letter from<br>his parents in which they told him briefly of Natásha’s illness and the<br>breaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew (which they explained by<br>Natásha’s having rejected him) and again asked Nicholas to retire from<br>the army and return home. On receiving this letter, Nicholas did not<br>even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the<br>army, but wrote to his parents that he was sorry Natásha was ill and her<br>engagement broken off, and that he would do all he could to meet their<br>wishes. To Sónya he wrote separately.<br><br>“Adored friend of my soul!” he wrote. “Nothing but honor could keep<br>me from returning to the country. But now, at the commencement of the<br>campaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comrades’ eyes but<br>in my own, if I preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the<br>Fatherland. But this shall be our last separation. Believe me, directly<br>the war is over, if I am still alive and still loved by you, I will<br>throw up everything and fly to you, to press you forever to my ardent<br>breast.”<br><br>It was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that prevented<br>Rostóv from returning home as he had promised and marrying Sónya. The<br>autumn in Otrádnoe with the hunting, and the winter with the Christmas<br>holidays and Sónya’s love, had opened out to him a vista of tranquil<br>rural joys and peace such as he had never known before, and which now<br>allured him. “A splendid wife, children, a good pack of hounds, a<br>dozen leashes of smart borzois, agriculture, neighbors, service by<br>election...” thought he. But now the campaign was beginning, and he had<br>to remain with his regiment. And since it had to be so, Nicholas Rostóv,<br>as was natural to him, felt contented with the life he led in the<br>regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life.<br><br>On his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully welcomed<br>by his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the<br>Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation<br>from his commanders. During his absence he had been promoted captain,<br>and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in<br>numbers, he was again allotted his old squadron.<br><br>The campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double pay,<br>new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody was<br>infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement<br>of a war, and Rostóv, conscious of his advantageous position in the<br>regiment, devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of<br>military service, though he knew that sooner or later he would have to<br>relinquish them.<br><br>The troops retired from Vílna for various complicated reasons of state,<br>political and strategic. Each step of the retreat was accompanied by<br>a complicated interplay of interests, arguments, and passions at<br>headquarters. For the Pávlograd hussars, however, the whole of this<br>retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies<br>was a very simple and agreeable business.<br><br>It was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness, and<br>intriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where<br>they were going or why. If they regretted having to retreat, it was only<br>because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to, or some<br>pretty young Polish lady. If the thought that things looked bad chanced<br>to enter anyone’s head, he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good<br>soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs, but only of<br>the task nearest to hand. First they camped gaily before Vílna, making<br>acquaintance with the Polish landowners, preparing for reviews and being<br>reviewed by the Emperor and other high commanders. Then came an order<br>to retreat to Sventsyáni and destroy any provisions they could not carry<br>away with them. Sventsyáni was remembered by the hussars only as the<br>drunken camp, a name the whole army gave to their encampment there,<br>and because many complaints were made against the troops, who, taking<br>advantage of the order to collect provisions, took also horses,<br>carriages, and carpets from the Polish proprietors. Rostóv remembered<br>Sventsyáni, because on the first day of their arrival at that small town<br>he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken<br>men of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five barrels<br>of old beer. From Sventsyáni they retired farther and farther to Drissa,<br>and thence again beyond Drissa, drawing near to the frontier of Russia<br>proper.<br><br>On the thirteenth of July the Pávlograds took part in a serious action<br>for the first time.<br><br>On the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there was a heavy<br>storm of rain and hail. In general, the summer of 1812 was remarkable<br>for its storms.<br><br>The two Pávlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye, which<br>was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and<br>horses. The rain was descending in torrents, and Rostóv, with a young<br>officer named Ilyín, his protégé, was sitting in a hastily constructed<br>shelter. An officer of their regiment, with long mustaches extending<br>onto his cheeks, who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the<br>rain, entered Rostóv’s shelter.<br><br>“I have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of Raévski’s<br>exploit?”<br><br>And the officer gave them details of the Saltánov battle, which he had<br>heard at the staff.<br><br>Rostóv, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water<br>trickled down his neck, listened inattentively, with an occasional<br>glance at Ilyín, who was pressing close to him. This officer, a lad<br>of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment, was now in the same<br>relation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to Denísov seven years<br>before. Ilyín tried to imitate Rostóv in everything and adored him as a<br>girl might have done.<br><br>Zdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke grandiloquently of<br>the Saltánov dam being “a Russian Thermopylae,” and of how a deed worthy<br>of antiquity had been performed by General Raévski. He recounted how<br>Raévski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had<br>charged with them beside him. Rostóv heard the story and not only said<br>nothing to encourage Zdrzhinski’s enthusiasm but, on the contrary,<br>looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing, though with no<br>intention of contradicting it. Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and<br>of 1807 Rostóv knew by experience that men always lie when describing<br>military exploits, as he himself had done when recounting them; besides<br>that, he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at<br>all as we can imagine or relate it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinski’s<br>tale, nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches<br>extending over his cheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, as was<br>his habit, and crowded Rostóv in the narrow shanty. Rostóv looked at him<br>in silence. “In the first place, there must have been such a confusion<br>and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Raévski did lead<br>his sons there, it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen<br>men nearest to him,” thought he, “the rest could not have seen how or<br>with whom Raévski came onto the dam. And even those who did see it<br>would not have been much stimulated by it, for what had they to do with<br>Raévski’s tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger?<br>And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did not depend on whether<br>they took the Saltánov dam or not, as we are told was the case at<br>Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a sacrifice? And why expose<br>his own children in the battle? I would not have taken my brother Pétya<br>there, or even Ilyín, who’s a stranger to me but a nice lad, but would<br>have tried to put them somewhere under cover,” Nicholas continued<br>to think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But he did not express his<br>thoughts, for in such matters, too, he had gained experience. He knew<br>that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to<br>pretend not to doubt it. And he acted accordingly.<br><br>“I can’t stand this any more,” said Ilyín, noticing that Rostóv did not<br>relish Zdrzhinski’s conversation. “My stockings and shirt... and the<br>water is running on my seat! I’ll go and look for shelter. The rain<br>seems less heavy.”<br><br>Ilyín went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.<br><br>Five minutes later Ilyín, splashing through the mud, came running back<br>to the shanty.<br><br>“Hurrah! Rostóv, come quick! I’ve found it! About two hundred yards away<br>there’s a tavern where ours have already gathered. We can at least get<br>dry there, and Mary Hendríkhovna’s there.”<br><br>Mary Hendríkhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a pretty young<br>German woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, whether from lack<br>of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in<br>the early days of their marriage, took her about with him wherever the<br>hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among<br>the hussar officers.<br><br>Rostóv threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to Lavrúshka to<br>follow with the things, and—now slipping in the mud, now splashing right<br>through it—set off with Ilyín in the lessening rain and the darkness<br>that was occasionally rent by distant lightning.<br><br>“Rostóv, where are you?”<br><br>“Here. What lightning!” they called to one another.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>In the tavern, before which stood the doctor’s covered cart, there were<br>already some five officers. Mary Hendríkhovna, a plump little blonde<br>German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bench<br>in the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep behind her.<br>Rostóv and Ilyín, on entering the room, were welcomed with merry shouts<br>and laughter.<br><br>“Dear me, how jolly we are!” said Rostóv laughing.<br><br>“And why do you stand there gaping?”<br><br>“What swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Don’t make our<br>drawing room so wet.”<br><br>“Don’t mess Mary Hendríkhovna’s dress!” cried other voices.<br><br>Rostóv and Ilyín hastened to find a corner where they could change into<br>dry clothes without offending Mary Hendríkhovna’s modesty. They were<br>going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but found it<br>completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light<br>of a solitary candle on an empty box, and these officers would on no<br>account yield their position. Mary Hendríkhovna obliged them with the<br>loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain, and behind that screen<br>Rostóv and Ilyín, helped by Lavrúshka who had brought their kits,<br>changed their wet things for dry ones.<br><br>A fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board was found,<br>fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small samovar was<br>produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and having asked Mary<br>Hendríkhovna to preside, they all crowded round her. One offered her a<br>clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands, another spread a jacket<br>under her little feet to keep them from the damp, another hung his coat<br>over the window to keep out the draft, and yet another waved the flies<br>off her husband’s face, lest he should wake up.<br><br>“Leave him alone,” said Mary Hendríkhovna, smiling timidly and happily.<br>“He is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night.”<br><br>“Oh, no, Mary Hendríkhovna,” replied the officer, “one must look after<br>the doctor. Perhaps he’ll take pity on me someday, when it comes to<br>cutting off a leg or an arm for me.”<br><br>There were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one could<br>not make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar held<br>only six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter to<br>take turns in order of seniority to receive one’s tumbler from Mary<br>Hendríkhovna’s plump little hands with their short and not overclean<br>nails. All the officers appeared to be, and really were, in love with<br>her that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition soon<br>left their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the general<br>mood of courting Mary Hendríkhovna. She, seeing herself surrounded by<br>such brilliant and polite young men, beamed with satisfaction, try as<br>she might to hide it, and perturbed as she evidently was each time her<br>husband moved in his sleep behind her.<br><br>There was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything<br>else, but it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary<br>Hendríkhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. Rostóv received<br>his tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary Hendríkhovna to stir<br>it.<br><br>“But you take it without sugar?” she said, smiling all the time, as if<br>everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and<br>had a double meaning.<br><br>“It is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should stir<br>my tea.”<br><br>Mary Hendríkhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone<br>meanwhile had pounced on.<br><br>“Use your finger, Mary Hendríkhovna, it will be still nicer,” said<br>Rostóv.<br><br>“Too hot!” she replied, blushing with pleasure.<br><br>Ilyín put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to<br>Mary Hendríkhovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.<br><br>“This is my cup,” said he. “Only dip your finger in it and I’ll drink it<br>all up.”<br><br>When they had emptied the samovar, Rostóv took a pack of cards and<br>proposed that they should play “Kings” with Mary Hendríkhovna. They drew<br>lots to settle who should make up her set. At Rostóv’s suggestion it<br>was agreed that whoever became “King” should have the right to kiss Mary<br>Hendríkhovna’s hand, and that the “Booby” should go to refill and reheat<br>the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.<br><br>“Well, but supposing Mary Hendríkhovna is ‘King’?” asked Ilyín.<br><br>“As it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!”<br><br>They had hardly begun to play before the doctor’s disheveled head<br>suddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendríkhovna. He had been awake for<br>some time, listening to what was being said, and evidently found nothing<br>entertaining or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad and<br>depressed. Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and asked<br>to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way. As soon as he<br>had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and Mary<br>Hendríkhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became<br>still more attractive to them. Returning from the yard, the doctor<br>told his wife (who had ceased to smile so happily, and looked at him in<br>alarm, awaiting her sentence) that the rain had ceased and they must go<br>to sleep in their covered cart, or everything in it would be stolen.<br><br>“But I’ll send an orderly.... Two of them!” said Rostóv. “What an idea,<br>doctor!”<br><br>“I’ll stand guard on it myself!” said Ilyín.<br><br>“No, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for two<br>nights,” replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his wife,<br>waiting for the game to end.<br><br>Seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers grew<br>still merrier, and some of them could not refrain from laughter, for<br>which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When he had gone, taking<br>his wife with him, and had settled down with her in their covered cart,<br>the officers lay down in the tavern, covering themselves with their<br>wet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long time; now they exchanged<br>remarks, recalling the doctor’s uneasiness and his wife’s delight, now<br>they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the<br>covered trap. Several times Rostóv, covering his head, tried to go<br>to sleep, but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be<br>resumed, to the accompaniment of unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>It was nearly three o’clock but no one was yet asleep, when the<br>quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town<br>of Ostróvna. Still laughing and talking, the officers began hurriedly<br>getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar. But<br>Rostóv went off to his squadron without waiting for tea. Day was<br>breaking, the rain had ceased, and the clouds were dispersing. It felt<br>damp and cold, especially in clothes that were still moist. As they left<br>the tavern in the twilight of the dawn, Rostóv and Ilyín both glanced<br>under the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctor’s cart, from<br>under the apron of which his feet were sticking out, and in the middle<br>of which his wife’s nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing<br>audible.<br><br>“She really is a dear little thing,” said Rostóv to Ilyín, who was<br>following him.<br><br>“A charming woman!” said Ilyín, with all the gravity of a boy of<br>sixteen.<br><br>Half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The command<br>was heard to “mount” and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted.<br>Rostóv riding in front gave the order “Forward!” and the hussars, with<br>clanking sabers and subdued talk, their horses’ hoofs splashing in the<br>mud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch<br>trees on each side, following the infantry and a battery that had gone<br>on in front.<br><br>Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding<br>before the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly grass<br>which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still<br>wet with the night’s rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also<br>wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one<br>side. The soldiers’ faces were more and more clearly visible. Rostóv,<br>always closely followed by Ilyín, rode along the side of the road<br>between two rows of birch trees.<br><br>When campaigning, Rostóv allowed himself the indulgence of riding not<br>a regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a sportsman,<br>he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, Donéts horse,<br>dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could<br>outgallop him. To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought<br>of the horse, of the morning, of the doctor’s wife, but not once of the<br>impending danger.<br><br>Formerly, when going into action, Rostóv had felt afraid; now he had<br>not the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had grown<br>used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because<br>he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He had grown<br>accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would<br>seem most likely to interest him—the impending danger. During the<br>first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached<br>himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time<br>it had come of itself. Now he rode beside Ilyín under the birch trees,<br>occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand, sometimes<br>touching his horse’s side with his foot, or, without turning round,<br>handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him, with as<br>calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride. He<br>glanced with pity at the excited face of Ilyín, who talked much and in<br>great agitation. He knew from experience the tormenting expectation of<br>terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could<br>help him.<br><br>As soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds,<br>the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning<br>after the storm; drops still continued to fall, but vertically now, and<br>all was still. The whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared<br>behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it. A few minutes later it<br>reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud, tearing its<br>edge. Everything grew bright and glittered. And with that light, and as<br>if in reply to it, came the sound of guns ahead of them.<br><br>Before Rostóv had had time to consider and determine the distance of<br>that firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstóy’s adjutant came galloping from<br>Vítebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.<br><br>The squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery—which had<br>also quickened their pace—rode down a hill, and passing through an empty<br>and deserted village again ascended. The horses began to lather and the<br>men to flush.<br><br>“Halt! Dress your ranks!” the order of the regimental commander was<br>heard ahead. “Forward by the left. Walk, march!” came the order from in<br>front.<br><br>And the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left flank of<br>our position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line. To<br>the right stood our infantry in a dense column: they were the reserve.<br>Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible through<br>the wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated by slanting morning<br>sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be seen the enemy’s<br>columns and guns. Our advanced line, already in action, could be heard<br>briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale.<br><br>At these sounds, long unheard, Rostóv’s spirits rose, as at the strains<br>of the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots, now together,<br>now several quickly one after another. Again all was silent and then<br>again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding<br>them.<br><br>The hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A cannonade<br>began. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron,<br>halted, spoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode up the hill to<br>the guns.<br><br>After Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.<br><br>“Form column! Prepare to charge!”<br><br>The infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry<br>to pass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their spears fluttering,<br>and trotted downhill toward the French cavalry which was seen below to<br>the left.<br><br>As soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered up<br>the hill to support the battery. As they took the places vacated by the<br>Uhlans, bullets came from the front, whining and whistling, but fell<br>spent without taking effect.<br><br>The sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an even more<br>pleasurable and exhilarating effect on Rostóv than the previous sounds<br>of firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening out<br>before him from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the movement<br>of the Uhlans. They swooped down close to the French dragoons, something<br>confused happened there amid the smoke, and five minutes later our<br>Uhlans were galloping back, not to the place they had occupied but more<br>to the left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans on chestnut horses and<br>behind them, in a large group, blue French dragoons on gray horses could<br>be seen.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>Rostóv, with his keen sportsman’s eye, was one of the first to catch<br>sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Nearer and<br>nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons<br>pursuing them. He could already see how these men, who looked so small<br>at the foot of the hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving their<br>arms and their sabers in the air.<br><br>Rostóv gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. He felt<br>instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons now, the<br>latter could not withstand them, but if a charge was to be made it must<br>be done now, at that very moment, or it would be too late. He looked<br>around. A captain, standing beside him, was gazing like himself with<br>eyes fixed on the cavalry below them.<br><br>“Andrew Sevastyánych!” said Rostóv. “You know, we could crush them....”<br><br>“A fine thing too!” replied the captain, “and really...”<br><br>Rostóv, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped to<br>the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the<br>word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following<br>him. Rostóv himself did not know how or why he did it. He acted as he<br>did when hunting, without reflecting or considering. He saw the dragoons<br>near and that they were galloping in disorder; he knew they could not<br>withstand an attack—knew there was only that moment and that if he let<br>it slip it would not return. The bullets were whining and whistling so<br>stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could<br>not restrain himself. He touched his horse, gave the word of command,<br>and immediately, hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his<br>deployed squadron, rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons.<br>Hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace<br>instinctively changed to a gallop, which grew faster and faster as they<br>drew nearer to our Uhlans and the French dragoons who galloped after<br>them. The dragoons were now close at hand. On seeing the hussars, the<br>foremost began to turn, while those behind began to halt. With the same<br>feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf, Rostóv<br>gave rein to his Donéts horse and galloped to intersect the path of the<br>dragoons’ disordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot<br>flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless<br>horse fell in among the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons were<br>galloping back. Rostóv, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed after<br>him. On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared it, and<br>almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would<br>immediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That Frenchman, by his<br>uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray horse<br>and urging it on with his saber. In another moment Rostóv’s horse dashed<br>its breast against the hindquarters of the officer’s horse, almost<br>knocking it over, and at the same instant Rostóv, without knowing why,<br>raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it.<br><br>The instant he had done this, all Rostóv’s animation vanished. The<br>officer fell, not so much from the blow—which had but slightly cut his<br>arm above the elbow—as from the shock to his horse and from fright.<br>Rostóv reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he<br>had vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on<br>the ground, the other being caught in the stirrup. His eyes, screwed<br>up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow, gazed up at<br>Rostóv with shrinking terror. His pale and mud-stained face—fair and<br>young, with a dimple in the chin and light-blue eyes—was not an enemy’s<br>face at all suited to a battlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike face.<br>Before Rostóv had decided what to do with him, the officer cried, “I<br>surrender!” He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the<br>stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rostóv’s face.<br>Some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the<br>saddle. On all sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was<br>wounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his<br>horse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him;<br>a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse. In front, the<br>French infantry were firing as they ran. The hussars galloped hastily<br>back with their prisoners. Rostóv galloped back with the rest, aware of<br>an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart. Something vague and<br>confused, which he could not at all account for, had come over him with<br>the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him.<br><br>Count Ostermann-Tolstóy met the returning hussars, sent for Rostóv,<br>thanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed to the Emperor<br>and would recommend him for a St. George’s Cross. When sent for by Count<br>Ostermann, Rostóv, remembering that he had charged without orders,<br>felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of<br>discipline. Ostermann’s flattering words and promise of a reward should<br>therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly, but he still felt<br>that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea. “But what<br>on earth is worrying me?” he asked himself as he rode back from the<br>general. “Ilyín? No, he’s safe. Have I disgraced myself in any way? No,<br>that’s not it.” Something else, resembling remorse, tormented him. “Yes,<br>oh yes, that French officer with the dimple. And I remember how my arm<br>paused when I raised it.”<br><br>Rostóv saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have<br>a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin. He was sitting in<br>his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about<br>him. The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound. He<br>glanced at Rostóv with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting.<br>Rostóv still had the same indefinite feeling, as of shame.<br><br>All that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that Rostóv,<br>without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and preoccupied.<br>He drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, and kept turning something<br>over in his mind.<br><br>Rostóv was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his, which to<br>his amazement had gained him the St. George’s Cross and even given him<br>a reputation for bravery, and there was something he could not at all<br>understand. “So others are even more afraid than I am!” he thought. “So<br>that’s all there is in what is called heroism! And did I do it for my<br>country’s sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes?<br>And how frightened he was! He thought that I should kill him. Why should<br>I kill him? My hand trembled. And they have given me a St. George’s<br>Cross.... I can’t make it out at all.”<br><br>But while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach<br>no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune in the<br>service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the affair at<br>Ostróvna he was brought into notice, received command of an hussar<br>battalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>On receiving news of Natásha’s illness, the countess, though not quite<br>well yet and still weak, went to Moscow with Pétya and the rest of the<br>household, and the whole family moved from Márya Dmítrievna’s house to<br>their own and settled down in town.<br><br>Natásha’s illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for<br>her parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness,<br>her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the<br>background. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider<br>in how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat<br>or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them<br>feel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to help<br>her. Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked much in<br>French, German, and Latin, blamed one another, and prescribed a great<br>variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them, but the simple<br>idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease<br>Natásha was suffering from, as no disease suffered by a live man can be<br>known, for every living person has his own peculiarities and always<br>has his own peculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown to<br>medicine—not a disease of the lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and so<br>on mentioned in medical books, but a disease consisting of one of the<br>innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs. This simple<br>thought could not occur to the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard<br>that he is unable to work his charms) because the business of their<br>lives was to cure, and they received money for it and had spent the best<br>years of their lives on that business. But, above all, that thought<br>was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were<br>really useful, as in fact they were to the whole Rostóv family. Their<br>usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for<br>the most part harmful (the harm was scarcely perceptible, as they<br>were given in small doses), but they were useful, necessary, and<br>indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and<br>of those who loved her—and that is why there are, and always will be,<br>pseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths. They satisfied<br>that eternal human need for hope of relief, for sympathy, and that<br>something should be done, which is felt by those who are suffering. They<br>satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child, when it<br>wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt. A child knocks itself<br>and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching<br>spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better when this is done. The child<br>cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no<br>remedy for its pain, and the hope of relief and the expression of its<br>mother’s sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it. The doctors were<br>of use to Natásha because they kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her<br>that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemist’s in<br>the Arbát and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble<br>and seventy kopeks, and if she took those powders in boiled water at<br>intervals of precisely two hours, neither more nor less.<br><br>What would Sónya and the count and countess have done, how would they<br>have looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been those pills<br>to give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken cutlets, and all the<br>other details of life ordered by the doctors, the carrying out of which<br>supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle? How would<br>the count have borne his dearly loved daughter’s illness had he not<br>known that it was costing him a thousand rubles, and that he would not<br>grudge thousands more to benefit her, or had he not known that if her<br>illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take<br>her abroad for consultations there, and had he not been able to explain<br>the details of how Métivier and Feller had not understood the symptoms,<br>but Frise had, and Múdrov had diagnosed them even better? What would the<br>countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid<br>for not strictly obeying the doctor’s orders?<br><br>“You’ll never get well like that,” she would say, forgetting her grief<br>in her vexation, “if you won’t obey the doctor and take your medicine at<br>the right time! You mustn’t trifle with it, you know, or it may turn to<br>pneumonia,” she would go on, deriving much comfort from the utterance of<br>that foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well as to herself.<br><br>What would Sónya have done without the glad consciousness that she had<br>not undressed during the first three nights, in order to be ready to<br>carry out all the doctor’s injunctions with precision, and that she<br>still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the<br>slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered?<br>Even to Natásha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices<br>were being made for her sake, and to know that she had to take medicine<br>at certain hours, though she declared that no medicine would cure her<br>and that it was all nonsense. And it was even pleasant to be able to<br>show, by disregarding the orders, that she did not believe in medical<br>treatment and did not value her life.<br><br>The doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and<br>regardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her. But when he had<br>gone into another room, to which the countess hurriedly followed him, he<br>assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though<br>there was danger, he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and<br>one must wait and see, that the malady was chiefly mental, but... And<br>the countess, trying to conceal the action from herself and from him,<br>slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient<br>with a more tranquil mind.<br><br>The symptoms of Natásha’s illness were that she ate little, slept<br>little, coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors said that<br>she could not get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in the<br>stifling atmosphere of the town, and the Rostóvs did not move to the<br>country that summer of 1812.<br><br>In spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out<br>of the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was fond of<br>such things made a large collection, and in spite of being deprived of<br>the country life to which she was accustomed, youth prevailed. Natásha’s<br>grief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life, it ceased<br>to press so painfully on her heart, it gradually faded into the past,<br>and she began to recover physically.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVII<br><br>Natásha was calmer but no happier. She not merely avoided all external<br>forms of pleasure—balls, promenades, concerts, and theaters—but she<br>never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She could not<br>sing. As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself, tears<br>choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those pure<br>times which could never return, tears of vexation that she should so<br>uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy.<br>Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy,<br>in face of her sorrow. Without any need of self-restraint, no wish to<br>coquet ever entered her head. She said and felt at that time that no<br>man was more to her than Nastásya Ivánovna, the buffoon. Something stood<br>sentinel within her and forbade her every joy. Besides, she had lost all<br>the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full<br>of hope. The previous autumn, the hunting, “Uncle,” and the Christmas<br>holidays spent with Nicholas at Otrádnoe were what she recalled oftenest<br>and most painfully. What would she not have given to bring back even a<br>single day of that time! But it was gone forever. Her presentiment at<br>the time had not deceived her—that that state of freedom and readiness<br>for any enjoyment would not return again. Yet it was necessary to live<br>on.<br><br>It comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly<br>imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the world. But<br>this was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself, “What next?”<br>But there was nothing to come. There was no joy in life, yet life was<br>passing. Natásha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to<br>anyone, but wanted nothing for herself. She kept away from everyone in<br>the house and felt at ease only with her brother Pétya. She liked to<br>be with him better than with the others, and when alone with him she<br>sometimes laughed. She hardly ever left the house and of those who came<br>to see them was glad to see only one person, Pierre. It would have been<br>impossible to treat her with more delicacy, greater care, and at the<br>same time more seriously than did Count Bezúkhov. Natásha unconsciously<br>felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society. But<br>she was not even grateful to him for it; nothing good on Pierre’s part<br>seemed to her to be an effort, it seemed so natural for him to be kind<br>to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness. Sometimes Natásha<br>noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence,<br>especially when he wanted to do something to please her, or feared that<br>something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her. She<br>noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness,<br>which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her.<br>After those involuntary words—that if he were free he would have asked<br>on his knees for her hand and her love—uttered at a moment when she was<br>so strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to Natásha of his feelings;<br>and it seemed plain to her that those words, which had then so comforted<br>her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort<br>a crying child. It was not because Pierre was a married man, but because<br>Natásha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of<br>which she had experienced with Kurágin that it never entered her head<br>that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her<br>part, still less on his, or even to the kind of tender, self-conscious,<br>romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known<br>several instances.<br><br>Before the end of the fast of St. Peter, Agraféna Ivánovna Belóva, a<br>country neighbor of the Rostóvs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions at<br>the shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that Natásha should fast<br>and prepare for Holy Communion, and Natásha gladly welcomed the idea.<br>Despite the doctor’s orders that she should not go out early in the<br>morning, Natásha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament,<br>not as they generally prepared for it in the Rostóv family by attending<br>three services in their own house, but as Agraféna Ivánovna did, by<br>going to church every day for a week and not once missing Vespers,<br>Matins, or Mass.<br><br>The countess was pleased with Natásha’s zeal; after the poor results of<br>the medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer<br>might help her daughter more than medicines and, though not without<br>fear and concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to Natásha’s wish and<br>entrusted her to Belóva. Agraféna Ivánovna used to come to wake Natásha<br>at three in the morning, but generally found her already awake. She was<br>afraid of being late for Matins. Hastily washing, and meekly putting on<br>her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla, Natásha, shivering in the fresh<br>air, went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn.<br>By Agraféna Ivánovna’s advice Natásha prepared herself not in their<br>own parish, but at a church where, according to the devout Agraféna<br>Ivánovna, the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were<br>never many people in the church; Natásha always stood beside Belóva in<br>the customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the<br>screen before the choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her, of<br>humility before something great and incomprehensible, seized her when<br>at that unusual morning hour, gazing at the dark face of the Virgin<br>illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light<br>falling from the window, she listened to the words of the service which<br>she tried to follow with understanding. When she understood them her<br>personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its<br>own. When she did not understand, it was sweeter still to think that<br>the wish to understand everything is pride, that it is impossible to<br>understand all, that it is only necessary to believe and to commit<br>oneself to God, whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments. She<br>crossed herself, bowed low, and when she did not understand, in horror<br>at her own vileness, simply asked God to forgive her everything,<br>everything, to have mercy upon her. The prayers to which she surrendered<br>herself most of all were those of repentance. On her way home at an<br>early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men<br>sweeping the street, and everybody within the houses was still asleep,<br>Natásha experienced a feeling new to her, a sense of the possibility<br>of correcting her faults, the possibility of a new, clean life, and of<br>happiness.<br><br>During the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every<br>day. And the happiness of taking communion, or “communing” as Agraféna<br>Ivánovna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to Natásha<br>so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.<br><br>But the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when, dressed in<br>white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the first time for<br>many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life<br>that lay before her.<br><br>The doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the<br>powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.<br><br>“She must certainly go on taking them morning and evening,” said<br>he, evidently sincerely satisfied with his success. “Only, please be<br>particular about it.<br><br>“Be quite easy,” he continued playfully, as he adroitly took the gold<br>coin in his palm. “She will soon be singing and frolicking about. The<br>last medicine has done her a very great deal of good. She has freshened<br>up very much.”<br><br>The countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked down at her<br>nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>At the beginning of July more and more disquieting reports about the war<br>began to spread in Moscow; people spoke of an appeal by the Emperor to<br>the people, and of his coming himself from the army to Moscow. And as<br>up to the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had been received,<br>exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of<br>Russia. It was said that the Emperor was leaving the army because it was<br>in danger, it was said that Smolénsk had surrendered, that Napoleon had<br>an army of a million and only a miracle could save Russia.<br><br>On the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was received<br>but was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the Rostóvs’, promised<br>to come to dinner next day, Sunday, and bring a copy of the manifesto<br>and appeal, which he would obtain from Count Rostopchín.<br><br>That Sunday, the Rostóvs went to Mass at the Razumóvskis’ private chapel<br>as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten o’clock, when the Rostóvs<br>got out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air, the shouts of<br>hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd, the dusty leaves<br>of the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of the band and the white<br>trousers of a battalion marching to parade, the rattling of wheels on<br>the cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot sunshine were all full of that<br>summer languor, that content and discontent with the present, which<br>is most strongly felt on a bright, hot day in town. All the Moscow<br>notabilities, all the Rostóvs’ acquaintances, were at the Razumóvskis’<br>chapel, for, as if expecting something to happen, many wealthy families<br>who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that<br>summer. As Natásha, at her mother’s side, passed through the crowd<br>behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them, she heard a<br>young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper.<br><br>“That’s Rostóva, the one who...”<br><br>“She’s much thinner, but all the same she’s pretty!”<br><br>She heard, or thought she heard, the names of Kurágin and Bolkónski. But<br>she was always imagining that. It always seemed to her that everyone<br>who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her. With a<br>sinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she found herself<br>in a crowd, Natásha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace<br>walked—as women can walk—with the more repose and stateliness the<br>greater the pain and shame in her soul. She knew for certain that she<br>was pretty, but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to.<br>On the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late, and<br>particularly so on this bright, hot summer day in town. “It’s Sunday<br>again—another week past,” she thought, recalling that she had been here<br>the Sunday before, “and always the same life that is no life, and the<br>same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live. I’m pretty,<br>I’m young, and I know that now I am good. I used to be bad, but now I<br>know I am good,” she thought, “but yet my best years are slipping by<br>and are no good to anyone.” She stood by her mother’s side and exchanged<br>nods with acquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the ladies’<br>dresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not<br>crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she thought<br>with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others,<br>and suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt horrified at her own<br>vileness, horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to<br>her.<br><br>A comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that<br>mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the<br>souls of the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary screen were closed,<br>the curtain was slowly drawn, and from behind it a soft mysterious voice<br>pronounced some words. Tears, the cause of which she herself did not<br>understand, made Natásha’s breast heave, and a joyous but oppressive<br>feeling agitated her.<br><br>“Teach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good<br>forever, forever!” she pleaded.<br><br>The deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and,<br>holding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his dalmatic<br>and, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a loud and<br>solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer....<br><br>“In peace let us pray unto the Lord.”<br><br>“As one community, without distinction of class, without enmity, united<br>by brotherly love—let us pray!” thought Natásha.<br><br>“For the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our souls.”<br><br>“For the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us,” prayed<br>Natásha.<br><br>When they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and<br>Denísov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she<br>remembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her<br>all the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed for those who love us,<br>she prayed for the members of her own family, her father and mother and<br>Sónya, realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward<br>them, and feeling all the strength of her love for them. When they<br>prayed for those who hate us, she tried to think of her enemies and<br>people who hated her, in order to pray for them. She included among her<br>enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her<br>father, and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she<br>remembered Anatole who had done her so much harm—and though he did not<br>hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy. Only at prayer did<br>she feel able to think clearly and calmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole,<br>as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and<br>devotion to God. When they prayed for the Imperial family and the Synod,<br>she bowed very low and made the sign of the cross, saying to herself<br>that even if she did not understand, still she could not doubt, and at<br>any rate loved the governing Synod and prayed for it.<br><br>When he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over his<br>breast and said, “Let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to Christ<br>the Lord!”<br><br>“Commit ourselves to God,” Natásha inwardly repeated. “Lord God, I<br>submit myself to Thy will!” she thought. “I want nothing, wish for<br>nothing; teach me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take<br>me!” prayed Natásha, with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing<br>herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some<br>invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself,<br>from her regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.<br><br>The countess looked round several times at her daughter’s softened face<br>and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.<br><br>Unexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual order<br>Natásha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool, the one he<br>knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it before the doors<br>of the sanctuary screen. The priest came out with his purple velvet<br>biretta on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down with an effort.<br>Everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in<br>surprise. Then came the prayer just received from the Synod—a prayer for<br>the deliverance of Russia from hostile invasion.<br><br>“Lord God of might, God of our salvation!” began the priest in that<br>voice, clear, not grandiloquent but mild, in which only the Slav clergy<br>read and which acts so irresistibly on a Russian heart.<br><br>“Lord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day in mercy and<br>blessing on Thy humble people, and graciously hear us, spare us, and<br>have mercy upon us! This foe confounding Thy land, desiring to lay<br>waste the whole world, rises against us; these lawless men are gathered<br>together to overthrow Thy kingdom, to destroy Thy dear Jerusalem, Thy<br>beloved Russia; to defile Thy temples, to overthrow Thine altars, and to<br>desecrate our holy shrines. How long, O Lord, how long shall the wicked<br>triumph? How long shall they wield unlawful power?<br><br>“Lord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with Thy might<br>our most gracious sovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander Pávlovich; be<br>mindful of his uprightness and meekness, reward him according to his<br>righteousness, and let it preserve us, Thy chosen Israel! Bless his<br>counsels, his undertakings, and his work; strengthen his kingdom by<br>Thine almighty hand, and give him victory over his enemy, even as Thou<br>gavest Moses the victory over Amalek, Gideon over Midian, and David over<br>Goliath. Preserve his army, put a bow of brass in the hands of those who<br>have armed themselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins with strength<br>for the fight. Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us;<br>confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us, may<br>they be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust before the<br>wind, and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them to flight; may<br>they be ensnared when they know it not, and may the plots they have laid<br>in secret be turned against them; let them fall before Thy servants’<br>feet and be laid low by our hosts! Lord, Thou art able to save both<br>great and small; Thou art God, and man cannot prevail against Thee!<br><br>“God of our fathers! Remember Thy bounteous mercy and loving-kindness<br>which are from of old; turn not Thy face from us, but be gracious to our<br>unworthiness, and in Thy great goodness and Thy many mercies regard not<br>our transgressions and iniquities! Create in us a clean heart and renew<br>a right spirit within us, strengthen us all in Thy faith, fortify our<br>hope, inspire us with true love one for another, arm us with unity of<br>spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest to us and<br>to our fathers, and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against<br>the destiny of those Thou hast sanctified.<br><br>“O Lord our God, in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust, let us<br>not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy, and give us a token of Thy<br>blessing, that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see it and<br>be put to shame and perish, and may all the nations know that Thou art<br>the Lord and we are Thy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this day, O Lord,<br>and grant us Thy salvation; make the hearts of Thy servants to rejoice<br>in Thy mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath<br>the feet of Thy faithful servants! For Thou art the defense, the succor,<br>and the victory of them that put their trust in Thee, and to Thee be all<br>glory, to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and forever, world without<br>end. Amen.”<br><br>In Natásha’s receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her<br>strongly. She listened to every word about the victory of Moses over<br>Amalek, of Gideon over Midian, and of David over Goliath, and about<br>the destruction of “Thy Jerusalem,” and she prayed to God with the<br>tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing, but without<br>fully understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer. She<br>shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness,<br>for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope, and its animation<br>by love. But she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under<br>foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more<br>of them that she might pray for them. But neither could she doubt the<br>righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees. She<br>felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the<br>punishment that overtakes men for their sins, and especially of her own<br>sins, and she prayed to God to forgive them all, and her too, and to<br>give them all, and her too, peace and happiness. And it seemed to her<br>that God heard her prayer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIX<br><br>From the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rostóvs’ with Natásha’s<br>grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that seemed to<br>be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own<br>horizon—from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all<br>earthly things, that had incessantly tormented him, no longer presented<br>itself. That terrible question “Why?” “Wherefore?” which had come to him<br>amid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question or by a<br>reply to the former question, but by her image. When he listened to, or<br>himself took part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of<br>human baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did<br>not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so<br>transient and incomprehensible—but he remembered her as he had last<br>seen her, and all his doubts vanished—not because she had answered<br>the questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of her<br>transferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of spiritual<br>activity in which no one could be justified or guilty—a realm of beauty<br>and love which it was worth living for. Whatever worldly baseness<br>presented itself to him, he said to himself:<br><br>“Well, supposing N. N. has swindled the country and the Tsar, and the<br>country and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter? She<br>smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her, and<br>no one will ever know it.” And his soul felt calm and peaceful.<br><br>Pierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same idle<br>and dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the Rostóvs’<br>there were other hours he had to spend somehow, and the habits and<br>acquaintances he had made in Moscow formed a current that bore him along<br>irresistibly. But latterly, when more and more disquieting reports came<br>from the seat of war and Natásha’s health began to improve and she<br>no longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity, an<br>ever-increasing restlessness, which he could not explain, took<br>possession of him. He felt that the condition he was in could not<br>continue long, that a catastrophe was coming which would change his<br>whole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that<br>approaching catastrophe. One of his brother Masons had revealed to<br>Pierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon, drawn from the<br>Revelation of St. John.<br><br>In chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:<br><br>Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of<br>the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred<br>threescore and six.<br><br>And in the fifth verse of the same chapter:<br><br>And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and<br>blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two<br>months.<br><br><br>The French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values as the<br>Hebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and the others<br>tens, will have the following significance:<br><br>      a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k<br>      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10<br>       l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s<br>      20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90<br>             t    u    v    w    x    y<br>            100  110  120  130  140  150<br>                        z<br>                       160<br><br>Writing the words L’Empereur Napoléon in numbers, it appears that the<br>sum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold<br>in the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the words<br>quarante-deux, * which was the term allowed to the beast that “spoke<br>great things and blasphemies,” the same number 666 was obtained; from<br>which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon’s power had come<br>in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy<br>pleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an<br>end to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the<br>same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an<br>answer to the question that engrossed him. He wrote the words L’Empereur<br>Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers, but the sums<br>were either more or less than 666. Once when making such calculations he<br>wrote down his own name in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the<br>sum of the numbers did not come right. Then he changed the spelling,<br>substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le, still<br>without obtaining the desired result. Then it occurred to him: if the<br>answer to the question were contained in his name, his nationality would<br>also be given in the answer. So he wrote Le russe Besuhof and adding<br>up the numbers got 671. This was only five too much, and five was<br>represented by e, the very letter elided from the article le before the<br>word Empereur. By omitting the e, though incorrectly, Pierre got the<br>answer he sought. L’russe Besuhof made 666. This discovery excited him.<br>How, or by what means, he was connected with the great event foretold in<br>the Apocalypse he did not know, but he did not doubt that connection for<br>a moment. His love for Natásha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion, the<br>comet, 666, L’Empereur Napoléon, and L’russe Besuhof—all this had to<br>mature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere<br>of Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a<br>great achievement and great happiness.<br><br>    * Forty-two.<br><br><br>On the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, Pierre had<br>promised the Rostóvs to bring them, from Count Rostopchín whom he knew<br>well, both the appeal to the people and the news from the army. In the<br>morning, when he went to call at Rostopchín’s he met there a courier<br>fresh from the army, an acquaintance of his own, who often danced at<br>Moscow balls.<br><br>“Do, please, for heaven’s sake, relieve me of something!” said the<br>courier. “I have a sackful of letters to parents.”<br><br>Among these letters was one from Nicholas Rostóv to his father. Pierre<br>took that letter, and Rostopchín also gave him the Emperor’s appeal to<br>Moscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders, and his own<br>most recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders, Pierre found in<br>one of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and rewarded, the name of<br>Nicholas Rostóv, awarded a St. George’s Cross of the Fourth Class for<br>courage shown in the Ostróvna affair, and in the same order the name<br>of Prince Andrew Bolkónski, appointed to the command of a regiment of<br>Chasseurs. Though he did not want to remind the Rostóvs of Bolkónski,<br>Pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their<br>son’s having received a decoration, so he sent that printed army order<br>and Nicholas’ letter to the Rostóvs, keeping the appeal, the bulletin,<br>and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner.<br><br>His conversation with Count Rostopchín and the latter’s tone of anxious<br>hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly<br>things were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of spies in<br>Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that Napoleon promised<br>to be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn, and the talk of the<br>Emperor’s being expected to arrive next day—all aroused with fresh force<br>that feeling of agitation and expectation in Pierre which he had been<br>conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet, and especially<br>since the beginning of the war.<br><br>He had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so<br>had he not been hindered, first, by his membership of the Society of<br>Freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual<br>peace and the abolition of war, and secondly, by the fact that when he<br>saw the great mass of Muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking<br>patriotism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step. But the chief<br>reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the<br>vague idea that he was L’russe Besuhof who had the number of the beast,<br>666; that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the<br>power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been<br>predestined from eternity, and that therefore he ought not to undertake<br>anything, but wait for what was bound to come to pass.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XX<br><br>A few intimate friends were dining with the Rostóvs that day, as usual<br>on Sundays.<br><br>Pierre came early so as to find them alone.<br><br>He had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he<br>not been so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that he carried his<br>bulk with evident ease.<br><br>He went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something. His coachman did<br>not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his master was<br>at the Rostóvs’ he stayed till midnight. The Rostóvs’ footman rushed<br>eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and<br>stick. Pierre, from club habit, always left both hat and stick in the<br>anteroom.<br><br>The first person he saw in the house was Natásha. Even before he saw<br>her, while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was practicing solfa<br>exercises in the music room. He knew that she had not sung since her<br>illness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him. He<br>opened the door softly and saw her, in the lilac dress she had worn at<br>church, walking about the room singing. She had her back to him when he<br>opened the door, but when, turning quickly, she saw his broad, surprised<br>face, she blushed and came rapidly up to him.<br><br>“I want to try to sing again,” she said, adding as if by way of excuse,<br>“it is, at least, something to do.”<br><br>“That’s capital!”<br><br>“How glad I am you’ve come! I am so happy today,” she said, with the old<br>animation Pierre had not seen in her for a long time. “You know Nicholas<br>has received a St. George’s Cross? I am so proud of him.”<br><br>“Oh yes, I sent that announcement. But I don’t want to interrupt you,”<br>he added, and was about to go to the drawing room.<br><br>Natásha stopped him.<br><br>“Count, is it wrong of me to sing?” she said blushing, and fixing her<br>eyes inquiringly on him.<br><br>“No... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?”<br><br>“I don’t know myself,” Natásha answered quickly, “but I should not like<br>to do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely. You<br>don’t know how important you are to me, how much you’ve done for me....”<br>She spoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her words. “I<br>saw in that same army order that he, Bolkónski” (she whispered the name<br>hastily), “is in Russia, and in the army again. What do you think?”—she<br>was speaking hurriedly, evidently afraid her strength might fail<br>her—“Will he ever forgive me? Will he not always have a bitter feeling<br>toward me? What do you think? What do you think?”<br><br>“I think...” Pierre replied, “that he has nothing to forgive.... If I<br>were in his place...”<br><br>By association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the day<br>when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not himself but<br>the best man in the world and free, he would ask on his knees for her<br>hand; and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took possession<br>of him and the same words rose to his lips. But she did not give him<br>time to say them.<br><br>“Yes, you... you...” she said, uttering the word you rapturously—“that’s<br>a different thing. I know no one kinder, more generous, or better than<br>you; nobody could be! Had you not been there then, and now too, I don’t<br>know what would have become of me, because...”<br><br>Tears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music<br>before her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and<br>down the room.<br><br>Just then Pétya came running in from the drawing room.<br><br>Pétya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and<br>resembled Natásha. He was preparing to enter the university, but he and<br>his friend Obolénski had lately, in secret, agreed to join the hussars.<br><br>Pétya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair.<br>He had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the<br>hussars.<br><br>Pierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what Pétya<br>was saying.<br><br>Pétya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.<br><br>“Well, what about my plan? Peter Kirílych, for heaven’s sake! You are my<br>only hope,” said Pétya.<br><br>“Oh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I’ll mention it, I’ll bring it<br>all up today.”<br><br>“Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?” asked the old count. “The<br>countess has been to Mass at the Razumóvskis’ and heard the new prayer.<br>She says it’s very fine.”<br><br>“Yes, I’ve got it,” said Pierre. “The Emperor is to be here tomorrow...<br>there’s to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility, and they are<br>talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me congratulate<br>you!”<br><br>“Yes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?”<br><br>“We are again retreating. They say we’re already near Smolénsk,” replied<br>Pierre.<br><br>“O Lord, O Lord!” exclaimed the count. “Where is the manifesto?”<br><br>“The Emperor’s appeal? Oh yes!”<br><br>Pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not find<br>them. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the countess<br>who entered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently expecting<br>Natásha, who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing<br>room.<br><br>“On my word, I don’t know what I’ve done with it,” he said.<br><br>“There he is, always losing everything!” remarked the countess.<br><br>Natásha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and<br>sat down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered, Pierre’s<br>features, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and while still<br>searching for the papers he glanced at her several times.<br><br>“No, really! I’ll drive home, I must have left them there. I’ll<br>certainly...”<br><br>“But you’ll be late for dinner.”<br><br>“Oh! And my coachman has gone.”<br><br>But Sónya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom, had<br>found them in Pierre’s hat, where he had carefully tucked them under the<br>lining. Pierre was about to begin reading.<br><br>“No, after dinner,” said the old count, evidently expecting much<br>enjoyment from that reading.<br><br>At dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new<br>chevalier of St. George, Shinshín told them the town news, of the<br>illness of the old Georgian princess, of Métivier’s disappearance from<br>Moscow, and of how some German fellow had been brought to Rostopchín<br>and accused of being a French “spyer” (so Count Rostopchín had told the<br>story), and how Rostopchín let him go and assured the people that he was<br>“not a spire at all, but only an old German ruin.”<br><br>“People are being arrested...” said the count. “I’ve told the countess<br>she should not speak French so much. It’s not the time for it now.”<br><br>“And have you heard?” Shinshín asked. “Prince Golítsyn has engaged a<br>master to teach him Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak French in<br>the streets.”<br><br>“And how about you, Count Peter Kirílych? If they call up the militia,<br>you too will have to mount a horse,” remarked the old count, addressing<br>Pierre.<br><br>Pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming not<br>to grasp what was said. He looked at the count.<br><br>“Oh yes, the war,” he said. “No! What sort of warrior should I make? And<br>yet everything is so strange, so strange! I can’t make it out. I don’t<br>know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these times no<br>one can answer for himself.”<br><br>After dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and<br>with a serious face asked Sónya, who was considered an excellent reader,<br>to read the appeal.<br><br>“To Moscow, our ancient Capital!<br><br>“The enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He<br>comes to despoil our beloved country.”<br><br>Sónya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count listened<br>with closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages.<br><br>Natásha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her father and<br>now at Pierre.<br><br>Pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The countess<br>shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression<br>in the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that the danger<br>threatening her son would not soon be over. Shinshín, with a sarcastic<br>smile on his lips, was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that<br>gave him the opportunity: Sónya’s reading, any remark of the count’s, or<br>even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself.<br><br>After reading about the dangers that threatened Russia, the hopes the<br>Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility,<br>Sónya, with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was<br>being paid to her, read the last words:<br><br>“We ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that Capital<br>and in other parts of our realm for consultation, and for the direction<br>of all our levies, both those now barring the enemy’s path and those<br>freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear. May the ruin he<br>hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may Europe delivered<br>from bondage glorify the name of Russia!”<br><br><br>“Yes, that’s it!” cried the count, opening his moist eyes and sniffing<br>repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he<br>added, “Let the Emperor but say the word and we’ll sacrifice everything<br>and begrudge nothing.”<br><br>Before Shinshín had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the<br>count’s patriotism, Natásha jumped up from her place and ran to her<br>father.<br><br>“What a darling our Papa is!” she cried, kissing him, and she again<br>looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her<br>with her better spirits.<br><br>“There! Here’s a patriot for you!” said Shinshín.<br><br>“Not a patriot at all, but simply...” Natásha replied in an injured<br>tone. “Everything seems funny to you, but this isn’t at all a joke....”<br><br>“A joke indeed!” put in the count. “Let him but say the word and we’ll<br>all go.... We’re not Germans!”<br><br>“But did you notice, it says, ‘for consultation’?” said Pierre.<br><br>“Never mind what it’s for....”<br><br>At this moment, Pétya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, came up<br>to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice<br>that was now deep and now shrill:<br><br>“Well, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, it’s as you please,<br>but I say definitely that you must let me enter the army, because I<br>can’t... that’s all....”<br><br>The countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her hands, and<br>turned angrily to her husband.<br><br>“That comes of your talking!” said she.<br><br>But the count had already recovered from his excitement.<br><br>“Come, come!” said he. “Here’s a fine warrior! No! Nonsense! You must<br>study.”<br><br>“It’s not nonsense, Papa. Fédya Obolénski is younger than I, and he’s<br>going too. Besides, all the same I can’t study now when...” Pétya<br>stopped short, flushed till he perspired, but still got out the words,<br>“when our Fatherland is in danger.”<br><br>“That’ll do, that’ll do—nonsense....”<br><br>“But you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything.”<br><br>“Pétya! Be quiet, I tell you!” cried the count, with a glance at his<br>wife, who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son.<br><br>“And I tell you—Peter Kirílych here will also tell you...”<br><br>“Nonsense, I tell you. Your mother’s milk has hardly dried on your lips<br>and you want to go into the army! There, there, I tell you,” and the<br>count moved to go out of the room, taking the papers, probably to reread<br>them in his study before having a nap.<br><br>“Well, Peter Kirílych, let’s go and have a smoke,” he said.<br><br>Pierre was agitated and undecided. Natásha’s unwontedly brilliant eyes,<br>continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, had reduced<br>him to this condition.<br><br>“No, I think I’ll go home.”<br><br>“Home? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... You don’t<br>often come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine,” said the count<br>good-naturedly, pointing to Natásha, “only brightens up when you’re<br>here.”<br><br>“Yes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business...” said<br>Pierre hurriedly.<br><br>“Well, then, au revoir!” said the count, and went out of the room.<br><br>“Why are you going? Why are you upset?” asked Natásha, and she looked<br>challengingly into Pierre’s eyes.<br><br>“Because I love you!” was what he wanted to say, but he did not say it,<br>and only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes.<br><br>“Because it is better for me to come less often... because... No, simply<br>I have business....”<br><br>“Why? No, tell me!” Natásha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.<br><br>They looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces. He tried<br>to smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he silently<br>kissed her hand and went out.<br><br>Pierre made up his mind not to go to the Rostóvs’ any more.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXI<br><br>After the definite refusal he had received, Pétya went to his room<br>and there locked himself in and wept bitterly. When he came in to tea,<br>silent, morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to<br>notice anything.<br><br>Next day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the Rostóvs’<br>domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him. That<br>morning Pétya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and<br>collar to look like a grown-up man. He frowned before his looking glass,<br>gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and finally, without saying a word<br>to anyone, took his cap and left the house by the back door, trying to<br>avoid notice. Pétya decided to go straight to where the Emperor was and<br>to explain frankly to some gentleman-in-waiting (he imagined the Emperor<br>to be always surrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count Rostóv,<br>in spite of his youth wished to serve his country; that youth could be<br>no hindrance to loyalty, and that he was ready to... While<br>dressing, Pétya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the<br>gentleman-in-waiting.<br><br>It was on the very fact of being so young that Pétya counted for success<br>in reaching the Emperor—he even thought how surprised everyone would be<br>at his youthfulness—and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair<br>and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown-up man.<br>But the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the<br>ever-increasing crowds moving toward the Krémlin, the less he remembered<br>to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man. As he approached<br>the Krémlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck<br>out his elbows in a menacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he<br>was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the<br>patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his<br>determination he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in,<br>rumbling beneath the archway. Beside Pétya stood a peasant woman, a<br>footman, two tradesmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing some<br>time in the gateway, Pétya tried to move forward in front of the others<br>without waiting for all the carriages to pass, and he began resolutely<br>working his way with his elbows, but the woman just in front of him, who<br>was the first against whom he directed his efforts, angrily shouted at<br>him:<br><br>“What are you shoving for, young lordling? Don’t you see we’re all<br>standing still? Then why push?”<br><br>“Anybody can shove,” said the footman, and also began working his elbows<br>to such effect that he pushed Pétya into a very filthy corner of the<br>gateway.<br><br>Pétya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp<br>collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a man’s.<br><br>He felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that if he were<br>now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would not be<br>admitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible to smarten oneself up<br>or move to another place, because of the crowd. One of the generals who<br>drove past was an acquaintance of the Rostóvs’, and Pétya thought of<br>asking his help, but came to the conclusion that that would not be a<br>manly thing to do. When the carriages had all passed in, the crowd,<br>carrying Pétya with it, streamed forward into the Krémlin Square which<br>was already full of people. There were people not only in the square,<br>but everywhere—on the slopes and on the roofs. As soon as Pétya found<br>himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous<br>voices of the crowd that filled the whole Krémlin.<br><br>For a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were bared,<br>and everyone rushed forward in one direction. Pétya was being pressed so<br>that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted, “Hurrah! hurrah!<br>hurrah!” Pétya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but could see<br>nothing except the people about him.<br><br>All the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm. A<br>tradesman’s wife standing beside Pétya sobbed, and the tears ran down<br>her cheeks.<br><br>“Father! Angel! Dear one!” she kept repeating, wiping away her tears<br>with her fingers.<br><br>“Hurrah!” was heard on all sides.<br><br>For a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush<br>forward.<br><br>Quite beside himself, Pétya, clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes<br>ferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting “hurrah!” as<br>if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else, but<br>on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed<br>forward and everybody shouted “hurrah!”<br><br>“So this is what the Emperor is!” thought Pétya. “No, I can’t petition<br>him myself—that would be too bold.” But in spite of this he continued<br>to struggle desperately forward, and from between the backs of those<br>in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth<br>spread out on it; but just then the crowd swayed back—the police<br>in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the<br>procession: the Emperor was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of<br>the Assumption—and Pétya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side<br>and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim<br>before his eyes and he lost consciousness. When he came to himself, a<br>man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of<br>his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock—probably a church clerk and<br>chanter—was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off<br>the pressure of the crowd with the other.<br><br>“You’ve crushed the young gentleman!” said the clerk. “What are you up<br>to? Gently!... They’ve crushed him, crushed him!”<br><br>The Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd spread<br>out again more evenly, and the clerk led Pétya—pale and breathless—to<br>the Tsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for Pétya, and suddenly a<br>crowd turned toward him and pressed round him. Those who stood nearest<br>him attended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him on the raised<br>platform of the cannon, and reproached those others (whoever they might<br>be) who had crushed him.<br><br>“One might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it? Killing<br>people! Poor dear, he’s as white as a sheet!”—various voices were heard<br>saying.<br><br>Pétya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain had<br>passed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained<br>a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who<br>would be returning that way. Pétya no longer thought of presenting his<br>petition. If he could only see the Emperor he would be happy!<br><br>While the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the Assumption—it<br>was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the Emperor’s<br>arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the<br>Turks—the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared, selling kvas,<br>gingerbread, and poppyseed sweets (of which Pétya was particularly<br>fond), and ordinary conversation could again be heard. A tradesman’s<br>wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had<br>cost; another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear. The clerk<br>who had rescued Pétya was talking to a functionary about the priests who<br>were officiating that day with the bishop. The clerk several times used<br>the word “plenary” (of the service), a word Pétya did not understand.<br>Two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking<br>nuts. All these conversations, especially the joking with the girls,<br>were such as might have had a particular charm for Pétya at his age, but<br>they did not interest him now. He sat on his elevation—the pedestal of<br>the cannon—still agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and by<br>his love for him. The feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when<br>he was being crushed, together with that of rapture, still further<br>intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion.<br><br>Suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment,<br>to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and the crowd rushed<br>impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing. Pétya too would<br>have run there, but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under<br>his protection stopped him. The firing was still proceeding when<br>officers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the<br>cathedral, and after them others in a more leisurely manner: caps were<br>again raised, and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back<br>again. At last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the<br>cathedral doors. “Hurrah! hurrah!” shouted the crowd again.<br><br>“Which is he? Which?” asked Pétya in a tearful voice, of those around<br>him, but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and Pétya,<br>fixing on one of those four men, whom he could not clearly see for the<br>tears of joy that filled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm<br>on him—though it happened not to be the Emperor—frantically shouted<br>“Hurrah!” and resolved that tomorrow, come what might, he would join the<br>army.<br><br>The crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, and began<br>to disperse. It was already late, and Pétya had not eaten anything and<br>was drenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home but stood with<br>that diminishing, but still considerable, crowd before the palace while<br>the Emperor dined—looking in at the palace windows, expecting he knew<br>not what, and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance<br>to dine with the Emperor and the court footmen who served at table,<br>glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows.<br><br>While the Emperor was dining, Valúev, looking out of the window, said:<br><br>“The people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again.”<br><br>The dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit, rose<br>and went out onto the balcony. The people, with Pétya among them, rushed<br>toward the balcony.<br><br>“Angel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!...” cried the crowd, and Pétya with<br>it, and again the women and men of weaker mold, Pétya among them, wept<br>with joy.<br><br>A largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand broke<br>off, fell on the balcony parapet, and then to the ground. A coachman in<br>a jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward and snatched it up. Several<br>people in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this the Emperor had<br>a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from<br>the balcony. Pétya’s eyes grew bloodshot, and still more excited by the<br>danger of being crushed, he rushed at the biscuits. He did not know why,<br>but he had to have a biscuit from the Tsar’s hand and he felt that he<br>must not give way. He sprang forward and upset an old woman who was<br>catching at a biscuit; the old woman did not consider herself defeated<br>though she was lying on the ground—she grabbed at some biscuits but<br>her hand did not reach them. Pétya pushed her hand away with his knee,<br>seized a biscuit, and as if fearing to be too late, again shouted<br>“Hurrah!” with a voice already hoarse.<br><br>The Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd began<br>to disperse.<br><br>“There! I said if only we waited—and so it was!” was being joyfully said<br>by various people.<br><br>Happy as Pétya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all<br>the enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home from<br>the Krémlin, but called on his friend Obolénski, who was fifteen and was<br>also entering the regiment. On returning home Pétya announced resolutely<br>and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would<br>run away. And next day, Count Ilyá Rostóv—though he had not yet quite<br>yielded—went to inquire how he could arrange for Pétya to serve where<br>there would be least danger.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXII<br><br>Two days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense number of carriages<br>were standing outside the Slobóda Palace.<br><br>The great halls were full. In the first were the nobility and gentry in<br>their uniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats<br>of blue cloth and wearing medals. In the noblemen’s hall there was<br>an incessant movement and buzz of voices. The chief magnates sat on<br>high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the Emperor,<br>but most of the gentry were strolling about the room.<br><br>All these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in their own<br>houses, were in uniform—some in that of Catherine’s day, others in that<br>of Emperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms of Alexander’s time or<br>the ordinary uniform of the nobility, and the general characteristic<br>of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these<br>diverse and familiar personalities, both old and young. The old men,<br>dim-eyed, toothless, bald, sallow, and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled,<br>were especially striking. For the most part they sat quietly in their<br>places and were silent, or, if they walked about and talked, attached<br>themselves to someone younger. On all these faces, as on the faces<br>of the crowd Pétya had seen in the Square, there was a striking<br>contradiction: the general expectation of a solemn event, and at the<br>same time the everyday interests in a boston card party, Peter the cook,<br>Zinaída Dmítrievna’s health, and so on.<br><br>Pierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman’s<br>uniform that had become too tight for him. He was agitated;<br>this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the<br>merchant-class—les états généraux (States-General)—evoked in him a whole<br>series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in<br>his soul: thoughts of the Contrat Social and the French Revolution. The<br>words that had struck him in the Emperor’s appeal—that the sovereign was<br>coming to the capital for consultation with his people—strengthened this<br>idea. And imagining that in this direction something important which<br>he had long awaited was drawing near, he strolled about watching and<br>listening to conversations, but nowhere finding any confirmation of the<br>ideas that occupied him.<br><br>The Emperor’s manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all moved<br>about discussing it. Besides the ordinary topics of conversation, Pierre<br>heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when<br>the Emperor entered, when a ball should be given in the Emperor’s<br>honor, whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole<br>provinces... and so on; but as soon as the war was touched on, or<br>what the nobility had been convened for, the talk became undecided and<br>indefinite. Then all preferred listening to speaking.<br><br>A middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of a retired<br>naval officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and a small crowd was<br>pressing round him. Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round<br>the speaker and listened. Count Ilyá Rostóv, in a military uniform of<br>Catherine’s time, was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd,<br>with all of whom he was acquainted. He too approached that group and<br>listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval, as he always did,<br>to what the speaker was saying. The retired naval man was speaking very<br>boldly, as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners<br>and from the fact that some people Pierre knew as the meekest and<br>quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement<br>with him. Pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group, listened,<br>and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal, but of views<br>quite different from his own. The naval officer spoke in a particularly<br>sonorous, musical, and aristocratic baritone voice, pleasantly<br>swallowing his r’s and generally slurring his consonants: the voice of<br>a man calling out to his servant, “Heah! Bwing me my pipe!” It was<br>indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority.<br><br>“What if the Smolénsk people have offahd to waise militia for the<br>Empewah? Ah we to take Smolénsk as our patte’n? If the noble awistocwacy<br>of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its loyalty to our<br>sov’weign the Empewah in other ways. Have we fo’gotten the waising of<br>the militia in the yeah ‘seven? All that did was to enwich the pwiests’<br>sons and thieves and wobbahs....”<br><br>Count Ilyá Rostóv smiled blandly and nodded approval.<br><br>“And was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at all! It only wuined<br>our farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... o’ ou’ men will wetu’n<br>neithah soldiers no’ peasants, and we’ll get only depwavity fwom them.<br>The nobility don’t gwudge theah lives—evewy one of us will go and bwing<br>in more wecwuits, and the sov’weign” (that was the way he referred to<br>the Emperor) “need only say the word and we’ll all die fo’ him!” added<br>the orator with animation.<br><br>Count Rostóv’s mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but<br>Pierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred,<br>but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had he<br>opened his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in his<br>head, with a shrewd though angry expression, standing near the first<br>speaker, interrupted him. Evidently accustomed to managing debates and<br>to maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct tones:<br><br>“I imagine, sir,” said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth, “that we<br>have been summoned here not to discuss whether it’s best for the empire<br>at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia.<br>We have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign<br>the Emperor has honored us. But to judge what is best—conscription or<br>the militia—we can leave to the supreme authority....”<br><br>Pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened his heart<br>against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude<br>into the deliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped forward and<br>interrupted him. He himself did not yet know what he would say, but he<br>began to speak eagerly, occasionally lapsing into French or expressing<br>himself in bookish Russian.<br><br>“Excuse me, your excellency,” he began. (He was well acquainted with<br>the senator, but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him<br>formally.) “Though I don’t agree with the gentleman...” (he hesitated:<br>he wished to say, “Mon très honorable préopinant”—“My very honorable<br>opponent”) “with the gentleman... whom I have not the honor of knowing,<br>I suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express<br>their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which<br>we can assist our Fatherland! I imagine,” he went on, warming to his<br>subject, “that the Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us<br>merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service, and<br>chair à canon * we are ready to make of ourselves—and not to obtain from<br>us any co-co-counsel.”<br><br>    * “Food for cannon.”<br><br><br>Many persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senator’s sarcastic<br>smile and the freedom of Pierre’s remarks. Only Count Rostóv was pleased<br>with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer, the<br>senator, and in general with whatever speech he had last heard.<br><br>“I think that before discussing these questions,” Pierre continued, “we<br>should ask the Emperor—most respectfully ask His Majesty—to let us know<br>the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our<br>forces now are, and then...”<br><br>But scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from<br>three sides. The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance,<br>a boston player who had always been well disposed toward him, Stepán<br>Stepánovich Adráksin. Adráksin was in uniform, and whether as a result<br>of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a<br>different man. With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face,<br>Adráksin shouted at Pierre:<br><br>“In the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor<br>about that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that right, the<br>Emperor could not answer such a question. The troops are moved<br>according to the enemy’s movements and the number of men increases and<br>decreases....”<br><br>Another voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years<br>of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies’ and knew as a bad<br>cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to Pierre,<br>interrupted Adráksin.<br><br>“Yes, and this is not a time for discussing,” he continued, “but for<br>acting: there is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy<br>Russia, to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our wives<br>and children.” The nobleman smote his breast. “We will all arise,<br>everyone of us will go, for our father the Tsar!” he shouted, rolling<br>his bloodshot eyes. Several approving voices were heard in the crowd.<br>“We are Russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith,<br>the throne, and the Fatherland! We must cease raving if we are sons of<br>our Fatherland! We will show Europe how Russia rises to the defense of<br>Russia!”<br><br>Pierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt that his<br>words, apart from what meaning they conveyed, were less audible than the<br>sound of his opponent’s voice.<br><br>Count Rostóv at the back of the crowd was expressing approval; several<br>persons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a<br>phrase, said:<br><br>“That’s right, quite right! Just so!”<br><br>Pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his<br>serfs, or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in<br>order to be able to improve it, but he was unable to speak. Many voices<br>shouted and talked at the same time, so that Count Rostóv had not time<br>to signify his approval of them all, and the group increased, dispersed,<br>re-formed, and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and<br>to the big table. Not only was Pierre’s attempt to speak unsuccessful,<br>but he was rudely interrupted, pushed aside, and people turned away<br>from him as from a common enemy. This happened not because they were<br>displeased by the substance of his speech, which had even been forgotten<br>after the many subsequent speeches, but to animate it the crowd needed a<br>tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate. Pierre became the<br>latter. Many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman, and all in<br>the same tone. Many spoke eloquently and with originality.<br><br>Glínka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized (cries<br>of “author! author!” were heard in the crowd), said that “hell must be<br>repulsed by hell,” and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning<br>flashes and thunderclaps, but “we will not be that child.”<br><br>“Yes, yes, at thunderclaps!” was repeated approvingly in the back rows<br>of the crowd.<br><br>The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald<br>seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed almost all of whom<br>Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing<br>boston at the clubs. With an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced<br>to the table. Pressed by the throng against the high backs of the<br>chairs, the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together.<br>Those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened<br>to supply it. Others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find<br>some thought and hastened to utter it. The old magnates, whom Pierre<br>knew, sat and turned to look first at one and then at another, and their<br>faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very<br>hot. Pierre, however, felt excited, and the general desire to show that<br>they were ready to go to all lengths—which found expression in the tones<br>and looks more than in the substance of the speeches—infected him too.<br>He did not renounce his opinions, but felt himself in some way to blame<br>and wished to justify himself.<br><br>“I only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices<br>when we know what is needed!” said he, trying to be heard above the<br>other voices.<br><br>One of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention was<br>immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table.<br><br>“Yes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!” shouted<br>one man.<br><br>“He is the enemy of mankind!” cried another. “Allow me to speak....”<br>“Gentlemen, you are crushing me!...”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXIII<br><br>At that moment Count Rostopchín with his protruding chin and alert eyes,<br>wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder, entered<br>the room, stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry.<br><br>“Our sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment,” said Rostopchín.<br>“I am straight from the palace. Seeing the position we are in, I think<br>there is little need for discussion. The Emperor has deigned to summon<br>us and the merchants. Millions will pour forth from there”—he pointed<br>to the merchants’ hall—“but our business is to supply men and not spare<br>ourselves.... That is the least we can do!”<br><br>A conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table.<br>The whole consultation passed more than quietly. After all the preceding<br>noise the sound of their old voices saying one after another, “I<br>agree,” or for variety, “I too am of that opinion,” and so on had even a<br>mournful effect.<br><br>The secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow<br>nobility and gentry, that they would furnish ten men, fully equipped,<br>out of every thousand serfs, as the Smolénsk gentry had done. Their<br>chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose<br>with apparent relief, and began walking up and down, arm in arm, to<br>stretch their legs and converse in couples.<br><br>“The Emperor! The Emperor!” a sudden cry resounded through the halls and<br>the whole throng hurried to the entrance.<br><br>The Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of<br>nobles. Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck curiosity. Pierre<br>stood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said. From<br>what he did hear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger<br>threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow<br>nobility. He was answered by a voice which informed him of the<br>resolution just arrived at.<br><br>“Gentlemen!” said the Emperor with a quivering voice.<br><br>There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so that<br>Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor saying<br>with emotion:<br><br>“I never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it has<br>surpassed my expectations. I thank you in the name of the Fatherland!<br>Gentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious....”<br><br>The Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and<br>rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.<br><br>“Yes, most precious... a royal word,” said Count Rostóv, with a sob. He<br>stood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything, understood<br>everything in his own way.<br><br>From the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the merchants.<br>There he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was among those who saw him<br>come out from the merchants’ hall with tears of emotion in his eyes.<br>As became known later, he had scarcely begun to address the merchants<br>before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling<br>voice. When Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out accompanied by two<br>merchants, one of whom Pierre knew, a fat otkupshchík. The other was<br>the mayor, a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard. Both were<br>weeping. Tears filled the thin man’s eyes, and the fat otkupshchík<br>sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating:<br><br>“Our lives and property—take them, Your Majesty!”<br><br>Pierre’s one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was<br>ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything. He now<br>felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought<br>an opportunity of effacing it. Having heard that Count Mamónov was<br>furnishing a regiment, Bezúkhov at once informed Rostopchín that he<br>would give a thousand men and their maintenance.<br><br>Old Rostóv could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears, and<br>at once consented to Pétya’s request and went himself to enter his name.<br><br>Next day the Emperor left Moscow. The assembled nobles all took off<br>their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs, and not<br>without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment,<br>feeling amazed themselves at what they had done.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK TEN: 1812<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>Napoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going<br>to Dresden, could not help having his head turned by the homage he<br>received, could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to the<br>stimulating influence of a June morning, and could not refrain from<br>bursts of anger in the presence of Kurákin and then of Balashëv.<br><br>Alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally<br>insulted. Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the best<br>way, because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great<br>commander. Rostóv charged the French because he could not restrain<br>his wish for a gallop across a level field; and in the same way the<br>innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their<br>personal characteristics, habits, circumstances, and aims. They were<br>moved by fear or vanity, rejoiced or were indignant, reasoned, imagining<br>that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will,<br>but they all were involuntary tools of history, carrying on a work<br>concealed from them but comprehensible to us. Such is the inevitable<br>fate of men of action, and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy<br>the less are they free.<br><br>The actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal<br>interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of that<br>time but its historic results.<br><br>Providence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal aims, to<br>further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all<br>expected—neither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still less any of those<br>who did the actual fighting.<br><br>The cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear to us<br>now. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand, its advance<br>into the heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for<br>a winter campaign and, on the other, the character given to the war<br>by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused<br>among the Russian people. But no one at the time foresaw (what now seems<br>so evident) that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand<br>men—the best in the world and led by the best general—could be destroyed<br>in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength, and led by<br>inexperienced commanders as the Russian army was. Not only did no one<br>see this, but on the Russian side every effort was made to hinder the<br>only thing that could save Russia, while on the French side, despite<br>Napoleon’s experience and so-called military genius, every effort was<br>directed to pushing on to Moscow at the end of the summer, that is, to<br>doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction.<br><br>In historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of<br>saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he<br>sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolénsk,<br>and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign<br>was even then understood. Russian authors are still fonder of telling<br>us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was<br>adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this plan some<br>of them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others to<br>Toll, and others again to Alexander himself—pointing to notes, projects,<br>and letters which contain hints of such a line of action. But all these<br>hints at what happened, both from the French side and the Russian, are<br>advanced only because they fit in with the event. Had that event not<br>occurred these hints would have been forgotten, as we have forgotten the<br>thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary<br>which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event<br>falsified them. There are always so many conjectures as to the issue of<br>any event that however it may end there will always be people to say:<br>“I said then that it would be so,” quite forgetting that amid their<br>innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect.<br><br>Conjectures as to Napoleon’s awareness of the danger of extending his<br>line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the depths<br>of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can<br>historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals,<br>or such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts are in flat<br>contradiction to such conjectures. During the whole period of the war<br>not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French<br>into the heart of the country, but from their first entry into Russia<br>everything was done to stop them. And not only was Napoleon not afraid<br>to extend his line, but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and<br>did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns, but very lazily.<br><br>At the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, and our sole<br>aim was to unite them, though uniting the armies was no advantage if we<br>meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country. Our<br>Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian<br>soil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuel’s<br>plan, and there was no intention of retiring farther. The Emperor<br>reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired. He could<br>not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach Smolénsk, still less<br>could he contemplate the burning of Moscow, and when our armies did<br>unite he was displeased that Smolénsk was abandoned and burned without a<br>general engagement having been fought under its walls.<br><br>So thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were still<br>more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the<br>depths of the country.<br><br>Napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and<br>missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he was at<br>Smolénsk and thought only of how to advance farther, though as we now<br>see that advance was evidently ruinous to him.<br><br>The facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the<br>advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then<br>think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring of<br>Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan,<br>for no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most complex<br>interplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who took part in<br>the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable, or of the one<br>way of saving Russia. Everything came about fortuitously. The armies<br>were divided at the commencement of the campaign. We tried to unite<br>them, with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the<br>enemy’s advance, and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle<br>with a much stronger enemy, and necessarily withdrawing the armies at<br>an acute angle—we led the French on to Smolénsk. But we withdrew at an<br>acute angle not only because the French advanced between our two armies;<br>the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther, because<br>Barclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by Bagratión (who<br>would come under his command), and Bagratión—being in command of the<br>second army—tried to postpone joining up and coming under Barclay’s<br>command as long as he could. Bagratión was slow in effecting the<br>junction—though that was the chief aim of all at headquarters—because,<br>as he alleged, he exposed his army to danger on this march, and it was<br>best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south, worrying<br>the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for<br>his army; and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under<br>the command of the detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank was inferior<br>to his own.<br><br>The Emperor was with the army to encourage it, but his presence and<br>ignorance of what steps to take, and the enormous number of advisers and<br>plans, destroyed the first army’s energy and it retired.<br><br>The intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but Paulucci,<br>aiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed his energy<br>to influence Alexander, and Pfuel’s whole plan was abandoned and the<br>command entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay did not inspire confidence<br>his power was limited. The armies were divided, there was no unity of<br>command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from this confusion, division,<br>and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief, there resulted<br>on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle (which we could<br>not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else,<br>instead of Barclay, been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing<br>indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal.<br><br>At last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and indeed<br>the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary<br>for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in<br>general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow<br>the strength of the Russian army was trebled.<br><br>He left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief’s undivided<br>control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action would then<br>be taken, but the command of the armies became still more confused and<br>enfeebled. Bennigsen, the Tsarévich, and a swarm of adjutants general<br>remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation<br>and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling less free than ever under<br>the observation of all these “eyes of the Emperor,” became still more<br>cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle.<br><br>Barclay stood for caution. The Tsarévich hinted at treachery and<br>demanded a general engagement. Lubomírski, Bronnítski, Wlocki, and the<br>others of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay, under<br>pretext of sending papers to the Emperor, dispatched these Polish<br>adjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with<br>Bennigsen and the Tsarévich.<br><br>At Smolénsk the armies at last reunited, much as Bagratión disliked it.<br><br>Bagratión drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by Barclay.<br>Barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior<br>officer Bagratión.<br><br>Despite his seniority in rank Bagratión, in this contest of magnanimity,<br>took his orders from Barclay, but, having submitted, agreed with him<br>less than ever. By the Emperor’s orders Bagratión reported direct to<br>him. He wrote to Arakchéev, the Emperor’s confidant: “It must be as<br>my sovereign pleases, but I cannot work with the Minister (meaning<br>Barclay). For God’s sake send me somewhere else if only in command of<br>a regiment. I cannot stand it here. Headquarters are so full of Germans<br>that a Russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything. I thought<br>I was really serving my sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out<br>that I am serving Barclay. I confess I do not want to.”<br><br>The swarm of Bronnítskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still further<br>embittered the relations between the commanders in chief, and even<br>less unity resulted. Preparations were made to fight the French before<br>Smolénsk. A general was sent to survey the position. This general,<br>hating Barclay, rode to visit a friend of his own, a corps commander,<br>and, having spent the day with him, returned to Barclay and condemned,<br>as unsuitable from every point of view, the battleground he had not<br>seen.<br><br>While disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of<br>battle, and while we were looking for the French—having lost touch with<br>them—the French stumbled upon Nevérovski’s division and reached the<br>walls of Smolénsk.<br><br>It was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smolénsk to save our<br>lines of communication. The battle was fought and thousands were killed<br>on both sides.<br><br>Smolénsk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and of the<br>whole people. But Smolénsk was burned by its own inhabitants who had<br>been misled by their governor. And these ruined inhabitants, setting<br>an example to other Russians, went to Moscow thinking only of their own<br>losses but kindling hatred of the foe. Napoleon advanced farther and we<br>retired, thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>The day after his son had left, Prince Nicholas sent for Princess Mary<br>to come to his study.<br><br>“Well? Are you satisfied now?” said he. “You’ve made me quarrel with my<br>son! Satisfied, are you? That’s all you wanted! Satisfied?... It hurts<br>me, it hurts. I’m old and weak and this is what you wanted. Well then,<br>gloat over it! Gloat over it!”<br><br>After that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week. He was<br>ill and did not leave his study.<br><br>Princess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the<br>old prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne either. Tíkhon alone attended him.<br><br>At the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way<br>of life, devoting himself with special activity to building operations<br>and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his<br>relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne. His looks and cold tone to his<br>daughter seemed to say: “There, you see? You plotted against me, you<br>lied to Prince Andrew about my relations with that Frenchwoman and made<br>me quarrel with him, but you see I need neither her nor you!”<br><br>Princess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas, watching<br>his lessons, teaching him Russian and music herself, and talking to<br>Dessalles; the rest of the day she spent over her books, with her old<br>nurse, or with “God’s folk” who sometimes came by the back door to see<br>her.<br><br>Of the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars. She<br>feared for her brother who was in it, was horrified by and amazed at<br>the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another, but she did not<br>understand the significance of this war, which seemed to her like all<br>previous wars. She did not realize the significance of this war, though<br>Dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested<br>in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her,<br>and though the “God’s folk” who came to see her reported, in their own<br>way, the rumors current among the people of an invasion by Antichrist,<br>and though Julie (now Princess Drubetskáya), who had resumed<br>correspondence with her, wrote patriotic letters from Moscow.<br><br>“I write you in Russian, my good friend,” wrote Julie in her Frenchified<br>Russian, “because I have a detestation for all the French, and the<br>same for their language which I cannot support to hear spoken.... We in<br>Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor.<br><br>“My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but the<br>news which I have inspires me yet more.<br><br>“You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Raévski, embracing his two<br>sons and saying: ‘I will perish with them but we will not be shaken!’<br>And truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we were<br>unshakable. We pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The<br>princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy<br>widows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our charpie, only<br>you, my friend, are missing...” and so on.<br><br>The chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance of<br>this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not recognize<br>it, and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner.<br>The prince’s tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary<br>unhesitatingly believed him.<br><br>All that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated.<br>He planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic<br>serfs. The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that<br>he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual,<br>changed his sleeping place every day. One day he would order his camp<br>bed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he remained on the<br>couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without<br>undressing, while—instead of Mademoiselle Bourienne—a serf boy read to<br>him. Then again he would spend a night in the dining room.<br><br>On August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his<br>first letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had<br>dutifully asked his father’s forgiveness for what he had allowed himself<br>to say and begged to be restored to his favor. To this letter the old<br>prince had replied affectionately, and from that time had kept the<br>Frenchwoman at a distance. Prince Andrew’s second letter, written near<br>Vítebsk after the French had occupied that town, gave a brief account of<br>the whole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts<br>as to the further progress of the war. In this letter Prince Andrew<br>pointed out to his father the danger of staying at Bald Hills, so near<br>the theater of war and on the army’s direct line of march, and advised<br>him to move to Moscow.<br><br>At dinner that day, on Dessalles’ mentioning that the French were said<br>to have already entered Vítebsk, the old prince remembered his son’s<br>letter.<br><br>“There was a letter from Prince Andrew today,” he said to Princess<br>Mary—“Haven’t you read it?”<br><br>“No, Father,” she replied in a frightened voice.<br><br>She could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had<br>arrived.<br><br>“He writes about this war,” said the prince, with the ironic smile that<br>had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war.<br><br>“That must be very interesting,” said Dessalles. “Prince Andrew is in a<br>position to know...”<br><br>“Oh, very interesting!” said Mademoiselle Bourienne.<br><br>“Go and get it for me,” said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne.<br>“You know—under the paperweight on the little table.”<br><br>Mademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.<br><br>“No, don’t!” he exclaimed with a frown. “You go, Michael Ivánovich.”<br><br>Michael Ivánovich rose and went to the study. But as soon as he had left<br>the room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down his napkin<br>and went himself.<br><br>“They can’t do anything... always make some muddle,” he muttered.<br><br>While he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and<br>even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The old prince returned<br>with quick steps, accompanied by Michael Ivánovich, bringing the letter<br>and a plan. These he put down beside him—not letting anyone read them at<br>dinner.<br><br>On moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary and,<br>spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his<br>eyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. When she had done so<br>Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father. He was examining the<br>plan, evidently engrossed in his own ideas.<br><br>“What do you think of it, Prince?” Dessalles ventured to ask.<br><br>“I? I?...” said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, and not taking<br>his eyes from the plan of the building.<br><br>“Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that...”<br><br>“Ha ha ha! The theater of war!” said the prince. “I have said and still<br>say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get<br>beyond the Niemen.”<br><br>Dessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of the<br>Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess Mary,<br>forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that what<br>her father was saying was correct.<br><br>“When the snow melts they’ll sink in the Polish swamps. Only they<br>could fail to see it,” the prince continued, evidently thinking of the<br>campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent. “Bennigsen should have<br>advanced into Prussia sooner, then things would have taken a different<br>turn...”<br><br>“But, Prince,” Dessalles began timidly, “the letter mentions<br>Vítebsk....”<br><br>“Ah, the letter? Yes...” replied the prince peevishly. “Yes... yes...”<br>His face suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused. “Yes, he<br>writes that the French were beaten at... at... what river is it?”<br><br>Dessalles dropped his eyes.<br><br>“The prince says nothing about that,” he remarked gently.<br><br>“Doesn’t he? But I didn’t invent it myself.”<br><br>No one spoke for a long time.<br><br>“Yes... yes... Well, Michael Ivánovich,” he suddenly went on, raising<br>his head and pointing to the plan of the building, “tell me how you mean<br>to alter it....”<br><br>Michael Ivánovich went up to the plan, and the prince after speaking to<br>him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and<br>went to his own room.<br><br>Princess Mary saw Dessalles’ embarrassed and astonished look fixed on<br>her father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that her<br>father had forgotten his son’s letter on the drawing room table; but she<br>was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his<br>confusion and silence, but was afraid even to think about it.<br><br>In the evening Michael Ivánovich, sent by the prince, came to Princess<br>Mary for Prince Andrew’s letter which had been forgotten in the drawing<br>room. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to her to do so,<br>ventured to ask him what her father was doing.<br><br>“Always busy,” replied Michael Ivánovich with a respectfully ironic<br>smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. “He’s worrying very much<br>about the new building. He has been reading a little, but now”—Michael<br>Ivánovich went on, lowering his voice—“now he’s at his desk, busy with<br>his will, I expect.” (One of the prince’s favorite occupations of late<br>had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death<br>and which he called his “will.”)<br><br>“And Alpátych is being sent to Smolénsk?” asked Princess Mary.<br><br>“Oh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>When Michael Ivánovich returned to the study with the letter, the old<br>prince, with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes, was sitting at his<br>open bureau with screened candles, holding a paper in his outstretched<br>hand, and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript—his<br>“Remarks” as he termed it—which was to be transmitted to the Emperor<br>after his death.<br><br>When Michael Ivánovich went in there were tears in the prince’s eyes<br>evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had<br>been written. He took the letter from Michael Ivánovich’s hand, put it<br>in his pocket, folded up his papers, and called in Alpátych who had long<br>been waiting.<br><br>The prince had a list of things to be bought in Smolénsk and, walking<br>up and down the room past Alpátych who stood by the door, he gave his<br>instructions.<br><br>“First, notepaper—do you hear? Eight quires, like this sample,<br>gilt-edged... it must be exactly like the sample. Varnish, sealing wax,<br>as in Michael Ivánovich’s list.”<br><br>He paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes.<br><br>“Then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed.”<br><br>Next, bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be<br>of a special shape the prince had himself designed, and a leather case<br>had to be ordered to keep the “will” in.<br><br>The instructions to Alpátych took over two hours and still the prince<br>did not let him go. He sat down, sank into thought, closed his eyes, and<br>dozed off. Alpátych made a slight movement.<br><br>“Well, go, go! If anything more is wanted I’ll send after you.”<br><br>Alpátych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into it,<br>fingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at the table<br>to write to the governor.<br><br>It was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished<br>to sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing<br>thoughts came to him in bed. So he called Tíkhon and went through the<br>rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.<br><br>He went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed<br>unsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study.<br>That couch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive<br>thoughts he had had when lying there. It was unsatisfactory everywhere,<br>but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than<br>other places: he had never slept there yet.<br><br>With the help of a footman Tíkhon brought in the bedstead and began<br>putting it up.<br><br>“That’s not right! That’s not right!” cried the prince, and himself<br>pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again.<br><br>“Well, at last I’ve finished, now I’ll rest,” thought the prince, and<br>let Tíkhon undress him.<br><br>Frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his<br>coat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on the<br>bed, and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his<br>withered yellow legs. He was not meditating, but only deferring the<br>moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the<br>bed. “Ugh, how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and you would<br>release me!” thought he. Pressing his lips together he made that effort<br>for the twenty-thousandth time and lay down. But hardly had he done so<br>before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if<br>it were breathing heavily and jolting. This happened to him almost every<br>night. He opened his eyes as they were closing.<br><br>“No peace, damn them!” he muttered, angry he knew not with whom. “Ah<br>yes, there was something else important, very important, that I was<br>keeping till I should be in bed. The bolts? No, I told him about them.<br>No, it was something, something in the drawing room. Princess Mary<br>talked some nonsense. Dessalles, that fool, said something. Something in<br>my pocket—can’t remember....”<br><br>“Tíkhon, what did we talk about at dinner?”<br><br>“About Prince Michael...”<br><br>“Be quiet, quiet!” The prince slapped his hand on the table. “Yes, I<br>know, Prince Andrew’s letter! Princess Mary read it. Dessalles said<br>something about Vítebsk. Now I’ll read it.”<br><br>He had the letter taken from his pocket and the table—on which stood a<br>glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle—moved close to the bed, and<br>putting on his spectacles he began reading. Only now in the stillness of<br>the night, reading it by the faint light under the green shade, did he<br>grasp its meaning for a moment.<br><br>“The French at Vítebsk, in four days’ march they may be at Smolénsk;<br>perhaps are already there! Tíkhon!” Tíkhon jumped up. “No, no, I don’t<br>want anything!” he shouted.<br><br>He put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And there<br>rose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian<br>camp, and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face,<br>vigorous and alert, entering Potëmkin’s gaily colored tent, and a<br>burning sense of jealousy of “the favorite” agitated him now as strongly<br>as it had done then. He recalled all the words spoken at that<br>first meeting with Potëmkin. And he saw before him a plump, rather<br>sallow-faced, short, stout woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile<br>and her words at her first gracious reception of him, and then that same<br>face on the catafalque, and the encounter he had with Zúbov over her<br>coffin about his right to kiss her hand.<br><br>“Oh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with all<br>the present! Quicker, quicker—and that they should leave me in peace!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolkónski’s estate, lay forty miles east<br>from Smolénsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.<br><br>The same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alpátych,<br>Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the<br>prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety,<br>though from Prince Andrew’s letter it was evident that to remain at Bald<br>Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter<br>by Alpátych to the Provincial Governor at Smolénsk, asking him to let<br>her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which<br>Bald Hills was exposed. Dessalles wrote this letter to the Governor<br>for Princess Mary, she signed it, and it was given to Alpátych with<br>instructions to hand it to the Governor and to come back as quickly as<br>possible if there was danger.<br><br>Having received all his orders Alpátych, wearing a white beaver hat—a<br>present from the prince—and carrying a stick as the prince did, went out<br>accompanied by his family. Three well-fed roans stood ready harnessed to<br>a small conveyance with a leather hood.<br><br>The larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed<br>with paper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive with<br>ringing bells; but on a long journey Alpátych liked to have them. His<br>satellites—the senior clerk, a countinghouse clerk, a scullery maid,<br>a cook, two old women, a little pageboy, the coachman, and various<br>domestic serfs—were seeing him off.<br><br>His daughter placed chintz-covered down cushions for him to sit on and<br>behind his back. His old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle, and one<br>of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle.<br><br>“There! There! Women’s fuss! Women, women!” said Alpátych, puffing and<br>speaking rapidly just as the prince did, and he climbed into the trap.<br><br>After giving the clerk orders about the work to be done, Alpátych, not<br>trying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his bald head and<br>crossed himself three times.<br><br>“If there is anything... come back, Yákov Alpátych! For Christ’s sake<br>think of us!” cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war and the<br>enemy.<br><br>“Women, women! Women’s fuss!” muttered Alpátych to himself and started<br>on his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the<br>still-green, thickly growing oats, and at other quite black fields just<br>being plowed a second time.<br><br>As he went along he looked with pleasure at the year’s splendid crop<br>of corn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were<br>already being reaped, made his calculations as to the sowing and the<br>harvest, and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the<br>prince’s orders.<br><br>Having baited the horses twice on the way, he arrived at the town toward<br>evening on the fourth of August.<br><br>Alpátych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the<br>road. As he approached Smolénsk he heard the sounds of distant firing,<br>but these did not impress him. What struck him most was the sight of a<br>splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which<br>was being mown down by the soldiers, evidently for fodder. This fact<br>impressed Alpátych, but in thinking about his own business he soon<br>forgot it.<br><br>All the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been<br>bounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that limit.<br>Everything not connected with the execution of the prince’s orders did<br>not interest and did not even exist for Alpátych.<br><br>On reaching Smolénsk on the evening of the fourth of August he put up<br>in the Gáchina suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by Ferapóntov,<br>where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years.<br>Some thirty years ago Ferapóntov, by Alpátych’s advice, had bought a<br>wood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now had a house, an<br>inn, and a corn dealer’s shop in that province. He was a stout, dark,<br>red-faced peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a<br>nose, similar knobs over his black frowning brows, and a round belly.<br><br>Wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, Ferapóntov was standing<br>before his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing Alpátych he went<br>up to him.<br><br>“You’re welcome, Yákov Alpátych. Folks are leaving the town, but you<br>have come to it,” said he.<br><br>“Why are they leaving the town?” asked Alpátych.<br><br>“That’s what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French.”<br><br>“Women’s fuss, women’s fuss!” said Alpátych.<br><br>“Just what I think, Yákov Alpátych. What I say is: orders have been<br>given not to let them in, so that must be right. And the peasants are<br>asking three rubles for carting—it isn’t Christian!”<br><br>Yákov Alpátych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar and for hay<br>for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.<br><br>All night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning Alpátych<br>donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business. It was a<br>sunny morning and by eight o’clock it was already hot. “A good day for<br>harvesting,” thought Alpátych.<br><br>From beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At eight<br>o’clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry. Many<br>people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers,<br>but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at their shops, and<br>service was being held in the churches as usual. Alpátych went to the<br>shops, to government offices, to the post office, and to the Governor’s.<br>In the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking<br>about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town,<br>everybody was asking what should be done, and all were trying to calm<br>one another.<br><br>In front of the Governor’s house Alpátych found a large number of<br>people, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governor’s. At the<br>porch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This man, an<br>ex-captain of police, was saying angrily:<br><br>“It’s no joke, you know! It’s all very well if you’re single. ‘One man<br>though undone is but one,’ as the proverb says, but with thirteen in<br>your family and all the property... They’ve brought us to utter ruin!<br>What sort of governors are they to do that? They ought to be hanged—the<br>brigands!...”<br><br>“Oh come, that’s enough!” said the other.<br><br>“What do I care? Let him hear! We’re not dogs,” said the ex-captain of<br>police, and looking round he noticed Alpátych.<br><br>“Oh, Yákov Alpátych! What have you come for?”<br><br>“To see the Governor by his excellency’s order,” answered Alpátych,<br>lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his<br>coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince.... “He has ordered<br>me to inquire into the position of affairs,” he added.<br><br>“Yes, go and find out!” shouted the angry gentleman. “They’ve brought<br>things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything!... There it<br>is again, do you hear?” said he, pointing in the direction whence came<br>the sounds of firing.<br><br>“They’ve brought us all to ruin... the brigands!” he repeated, and<br>descended the porch steps.<br><br>Alpátych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting room were<br>tradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at one another. The<br>door of the Governor’s room opened and they all rose and moved forward.<br>An official ran out, said some words to a merchant, called a stout<br>official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him, and vanished<br>again, evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions<br>addressed to him. Alpátych moved forward and next time the official came<br>out addressed him, one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat,<br>and handed him two letters.<br><br>“To his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince Bolkónski,” he<br>announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned<br>to him and took the letters.<br><br>A few minutes later the Governor received Alpátych and hurriedly said to<br>him:<br><br>“Inform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I acted on the<br>highest instructions—here...” and he handed a paper to Alpátych. “Still,<br>as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to Moscow. I am<br>just starting myself. Inform them...”<br><br>But the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer ran into the<br>room and began to say something in French. The Governor’s face expressed<br>terror.<br><br>“Go,” he said, nodding his head to Alpátych, and began questioning the<br>officer.<br><br>Eager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on Alpátych when he came<br>out of the Governor’s room. Involuntarily listening now to the firing,<br>which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength, Alpátych hurried<br>to his inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor said this:<br><br>“I assure you that the town of Smolénsk is not in the slightest danger<br>as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any. I from<br>the one side and Prince Bagratión from the other are marching to unite<br>our forces before Smolénsk, which junction will be effected on the<br>22nd instant, and both armies with their united forces will defend our<br>compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts<br>shall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland, or till the last<br>warrior in our valiant ranks has perished. From this you will see that<br>you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of Smolénsk, for<br>those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory.”<br>(Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to Baron Asch, the civil governor of<br>Smolénsk, 1812.)<br><br>People were anxiously roaming about the streets.<br><br>Carts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept<br>emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets.<br>Loaded carts stood at the house next to Ferapóntov’s and women were<br>wailing and lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round<br>barking in front of the harnessed horses.<br><br>Alpátych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went<br>straight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman was<br>asleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the passage.<br>From the host’s room came the sounds of a child crying, the despairing<br>sobs of a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of Ferapóntov. The cook<br>began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen,<br>just as Alpátych entered.<br><br>“He’s done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat her... dragged her<br>about so!...”<br><br>“What for?” asked Alpátych.<br><br>“She kept begging to go away. She’s a woman! ‘Take me away,’ says she,<br>‘don’t let me perish with my little children! Folks,’ she says, ‘are all<br>gone, so why,’ she says, ‘don’t we go?’ And he began beating and pulling<br>her about so!”<br><br>At these words Alpátych nodded as if in approval, and not wishing to<br>hear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeper’s, where<br>he had left his purchases.<br><br>“You brute, you murderer!” screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a baby<br>in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head, burst through the door<br>at that moment and down the steps into the yard.<br><br>Ferapóntov came out after her, but on seeing Alpátych adjusted his<br>waistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed Alpátych into the<br>opposite room.<br><br>“Going already?” said he.<br><br>Alpátych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his packages<br>and asked how much he owed.<br><br>“We’ll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governor’s?” asked<br>Ferapóntov. “What has been decided?”<br><br>Alpátych replied that the Governor had not told him anything definite.<br><br>“With our business, how can we get away?” said Ferapóntov. “We’d have<br>to pay seven rubles a cartload to Dorogobúzh and I tell them they’re<br>not Christians to ask it! Selivánov, now, did a good stroke last<br>Thursday—sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack. Will you have<br>some tea?” he added.<br><br>While the horses were being harnessed Alpátych and Ferapóntov over their<br>tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather for<br>harvesting.<br><br>“Well, it seems to be getting quieter,” remarked Ferapóntov, finishing<br>his third cup of tea and getting up. “Ours must have got the best of it.<br>The orders were not to let them in. So we’re in force, it seems....<br>They say the other day Matthew Iványch Plátov drove them into the river<br>Márina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day.”<br><br>Alpátych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who had come<br>in, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels, hoofs, and<br>bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out.<br><br>It was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in shadow, the<br>other half brightly lit by the sun. Alpátych looked out of the window<br>and went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling<br>and thud was heard, followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull<br>roar that set the windows rattling.<br><br>He went out into the street: two men were running past toward the<br>bridge. From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of<br>cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds<br>were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the<br>town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town was<br>being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered<br>up after four o’clock. The people did not at once realize the meaning of<br>this bombardment.<br><br>At first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused<br>curiosity. Ferapóntov’s wife, who till then had not ceased wailing under<br>the shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate,<br>listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people.<br><br>The cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively curiosity<br>everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over<br>their heads. Several people came round the corner talking eagerly.<br><br>“What force!” remarked one. “Knocked the roof and ceiling all to<br>splinters!”<br><br>“Routed up the earth like a pig,” said another.<br><br>“That’s grand, it bucks one up!” laughed the first. “Lucky you jumped<br>aside, or it would have wiped you out!”<br><br>Others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen<br>on a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, now with<br>the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the agreeable<br>intermittent whistle of a shell, flew over people’s heads incessantly,<br>but not one fell close by, they all flew over. Alpátych was getting into<br>his trap. The innkeeper stood at the gate.<br><br>“What are you staring at?” he shouted to the cook, who in her red skirt,<br>with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped to the<br>corner to listen to what was being said.<br><br>“What marvels!” she exclaimed, but hearing her master’s voice she turned<br>back, pulling down her tucked-up skirt.<br><br>Once more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping<br>downwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the<br>street, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.<br><br>“Scoundrel, what are you doing?” shouted the innkeeper, rushing to the<br>cook.<br><br>At that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different<br>sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently<br>with pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was her<br>wailing.<br><br>“Oh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don’t let me die! My good<br>souls!...”<br><br>Five minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her<br>thigh broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen.<br>Alpátych, his coachman, Ferapóntov’s wife and children and the house<br>porter were all sitting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns, the<br>whistling of projectiles, and the piteous moaning of the cook, which<br>rose above the other sounds, did not cease for a moment. The mistress<br>rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked<br>in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained<br>in the street. A shopman who entered told her that her husband had<br>gone with others to the cathedral, whence they were fetching the<br>wonder-working icon of Smolénsk.<br><br>Toward dusk the cannonade began to subside. Alpátych left the cellar<br>and stopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had been so clear was<br>clouded with smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new moon<br>shone strangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush<br>seemed to reign over the town, broken only by the rustle of footsteps,<br>the moaning, the distant cries, and the crackle of fires which seemed<br>widespread everywhere. The cook’s moans had now subsided. On two sides<br>black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires. Through<br>the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in<br>different directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill. Several of them<br>ran into Ferapóntov’s yard before Alpátych’s eyes. Alpátych went out<br>to the gate. A retreating regiment, thronging and hurrying, blocked the<br>street.<br><br>Noticing him, an officer said: “The town is being abandoned. Get away,<br>get away!” and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:<br><br>“I’ll teach you to run into the yards!”<br><br>Alpátych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him to<br>set off. Ferapóntov’s whole household came out too, following Alpátych<br>and the coachman. The women, who had been silent till then, suddenly<br>began to wail as they looked at the fires—the smoke and even the flames<br>of which could be seen in the failing twilight—and as if in reply the<br>same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street.<br>Inside the shed Alpátych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and<br>traces of their horses with trembling hands.<br><br>As Alpátych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in<br>Ferapóntov’s open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and<br>knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then Ferapóntov returned<br>and entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at<br>them, but suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair, burst into sobs<br>and laughter:<br><br>“Loot everything, lads! Don’t let those devils get it!” he cried, taking<br>some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street.<br><br>Some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on<br>filling their bags. On seeing Alpátych, Ferapóntov turned to him:<br><br>“Russia is done for!” he cried. “Alpátych, I’ll set the place on fire<br>myself. We’re done for!...” and Ferapóntov ran into the yard.<br><br>Soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking<br>it completely, so that Alpátych could not pass out and had to wait.<br>Ferapóntov’s wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till<br>it was possible to drive out.<br><br>Night had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out<br>amid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the Dnieper<br>Alpátych’s cart and that of the innkeeper’s wife, which were slowly<br>moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had to stop.<br>In a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped, a<br>house and some shops were on fire. This fire was already burning itself<br>out. The flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke, now<br>suddenly flared up again brightly, lighting up with strange distinctness<br>the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads. Black figures<br>flitted about before the fire, and through the incessant crackling of<br>the flames talking and shouting could be heard. Seeing that his trap<br>would not be able to move on for some time, Alpátych got down and turned<br>into the side street to look at the fire. Soldiers were continually<br>rushing backwards and forwards near it, and he saw two of them and a<br>man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the<br>street, while others carried bundles of hay.<br><br>Alpátych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was<br>blazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen<br>in, the wooden roof was collapsing, and the rafters were alight. The<br>crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in, and Alpátych<br>watched for it too.<br><br>“Alpátych!” a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.<br><br>“Mercy on us! Your excellency!” answered Alpátych, immediately<br>recognizing the voice of his young prince.<br><br>Prince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was looking<br>at Alpátych from the back of the crowd.<br><br>“Why are you here?” he asked.<br><br>“Your... your excellency,” stammered Alpátych and broke into sobs. “Are<br>we really lost? Master!...”<br><br>“Why are you here?” Prince Andrew repeated.<br><br>At that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master’s pale<br>worn face. Alpátych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it<br>was to get away.<br><br>“Are we really quite lost, your excellency?” he asked again.<br><br>Prince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee<br>began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his sister:<br><br>“Smolénsk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the enemy<br>within a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at once when<br>you will start. Send by special messenger to Usvyázh.”<br><br>Having written this and given the paper to Alpátych, he told him how<br>to arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the<br>boy’s tutor, and how and where to let him know immediately. Before<br>he had had time to finish giving these instructions, a chief of staff<br>followed by a suite galloped up to him.<br><br>“You are a colonel?” shouted the chief of staff with a German accent,<br>in a voice familiar to Prince Andrew. “Houses are set on fire in your<br>presence and you stand by! What does this mean? You will answer for<br>it!” shouted Berg, who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the<br>commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army, a place,<br>as Berg said, “very agreeable and well en évidence.”<br><br>Prince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to<br>Alpátych.<br><br>“So tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, and if by the<br>tenth I don’t receive news that they have all got away I shall have to<br>throw up everything and come myself to Bald Hills.”<br><br>“Prince,” said Berg, recognizing Prince Andrew, “I only spoke because<br>I have to obey orders, because I always do obey exactly.... You must<br>please excuse me,” he went on apologetically.<br><br>Something cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a moment and<br>wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. There was another<br>terrible crash and something huge collapsed.<br><br>“Ou-rou-rou!” yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the collapsing roof<br>of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all<br>around. The flames flared up again, lighting the animated, delighted,<br>exhausted faces of the spectators.<br><br>The man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted:<br><br>“It’s fine, lads! Now it’s raging... It’s fine!”<br><br>“That’s the owner himself,” cried several voices.<br><br>“Well then,” continued Prince Andrew to Alpátych, “report to them as I<br>have told you”; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute beside<br>him, he touched his horse and rode down the side street.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>From Smolénsk the troops continued to retreat, followed by the enemy.<br>On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was marching<br>along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills. Heat and<br>drought had continued for more than three weeks. Each day fleecy clouds<br>floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun, but toward<br>evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish-brown mist.<br>Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth. The unreaped corn was<br>scorched and shed its grain. The marshes dried up. The cattle lowed from<br>hunger, finding no food on the sun-parched meadows. Only at night and<br>in the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness. But on the<br>road, the highroad along which the troops marched, there was no such<br>freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest; the<br>dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches<br>deep. As soon as day dawned the march began. The artillery and baggage<br>wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very<br>hubs of the wheels, and the infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft,<br>choking, hot dust that never cooled even at night. Some of this dust<br>was kneaded by the feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a<br>cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and<br>worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that<br>road. The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and<br>through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked<br>eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded<br>sky. There was no wind, and the men choked in that motionless<br>atmosphere. They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and<br>mouths. When they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells<br>and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud.<br><br>Prince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of that<br>regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving<br>and giving orders, engrossed him. The burning of Smolénsk and its<br>abandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger against<br>the foe made him forget his own sorrow. He was entirely devoted to the<br>affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and<br>officers. In the regiment they called him “our prince,” were proud<br>of him and loved him. But he was kind and gentle only to those of his<br>regiment, to Timókhin and the like—people quite new to him, belonging<br>to a different world and who could not know and understand his past. As<br>soon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the<br>staff, he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful, ironical, and<br>contemptuous. Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to<br>him, and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself<br>to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair.<br><br>In truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to<br>Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smolénsk on the sixth<br>of August (he considered that it could and should have been defended)<br>and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to<br>pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled.<br>But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to<br>think about entirely apart from general questions. Two days previously<br>he had received news that his father, son, and sister had left for<br>Moscow; and though there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince<br>Andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that<br>he must ride there.<br><br>He ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on the<br>march, rode to his father’s estate where he had been born and spent his<br>childhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens<br>of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden<br>beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that<br>the little washing wharf, torn from its place and half submerged, was<br>floating on its side in the middle of the pond. He rode to the keeper’s<br>lodge. No one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door<br>stood open. Grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths, and<br>horses and calves were straying in the English park. Prince Andrew rode<br>up to the hothouse; some of the glass panes were broken, and of the<br>trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up. He called for<br>Tarás the gardener, but no one replied. Having gone round the corner<br>of the hothouse to the ornamental garden, he saw that the carved garden<br>fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with<br>the fruit. An old peasant whom Prince Andrew in his childhood had often<br>seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast<br>shoe.<br><br>He was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting on<br>the seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him strips of<br>bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia.<br><br>Prince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old garden had<br>been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of<br>the house among the rosebushes. The shutters were all closed, except at<br>one window which was open. A little serf boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran<br>into the house. Alpátych, having sent his family away, was alone at<br>Bald Hills and was sitting indoors reading the Lives of the Saints. On<br>hearing that Prince Andrew had come, he went out with his spectacles on<br>his nose, buttoning his coat, and, hastily stepping up, without a word<br>began weeping and kissing Prince Andrew’s knee.<br><br>Then, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to report<br>on the position of affairs. Everything precious and valuable had been<br>removed to Boguchárovo. Seventy quarters of grain had also been carted<br>away. The hay and the spring corn, of which Alpátych said there had been<br>a remarkable crop that year, had been commandeered by the troops and<br>mown down while still green. The peasants were ruined; some of them too<br>had gone to Boguchárovo, only a few remained.<br><br>Without waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:<br><br>“When did my father and sister leave?” meaning when did they leave for<br>Moscow.<br><br>Alpátych, understanding the question to refer to their departure for<br>Boguchárovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and again went<br>into details concerning the estate management, asking for instructions.<br><br>“Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them?<br>We have still six hundred quarters left,” he inquired.<br><br>“What am I to say to him?” thought Prince Andrew, looking down on the<br>old man’s bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on<br>his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions<br>were and only asked them to allay his grief.<br><br>“Yes, let them have it,” replied Prince Andrew.<br><br>“If you noticed some disorder in the garden,” said Alpátych, “it was<br>impossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent<br>the night, dragoons mostly. I took down the name and rank of their<br>commanding officer, to hand in a complaint about it.”<br><br>“Well, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here if the enemy<br>occupies the place?” asked Prince Andrew.<br><br>Alpátych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, and suddenly<br>with a solemn gesture raised his arm.<br><br>“He is my refuge! His will be done!” he exclaimed.<br><br>A group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward<br>the prince.<br><br>“Well, good-by!” said Prince Andrew, bending over to Alpátych. “You<br>must go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the<br>Ryazán estate or to the one near Moscow.”<br><br>Alpátych clung to Prince Andrew’s leg and burst into sobs. Gently<br>disengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the<br>avenue at a gallop.<br><br>The old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like a fly<br>impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping the last on<br>which he was making the bast shoe, and two little girls, running out<br>from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from<br>the trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the young master,<br>the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the<br>hand and hid with her behind a birch tree, not stopping to pick up some<br>green plums they had dropped.<br><br>Prince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to let them<br>see that they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty frightened<br>little girl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible<br>desire to do so. A new sensation of comfort and relief came over him<br>when, seeing these girls, he realized the existence of other human<br>interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those<br>that occupied him. Evidently these girls passionately desired one<br>thing—to carry away and eat those green plums without being caught—and<br>Prince Andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise. He<br>could not resist looking at them once more. Believing their danger past,<br>they sprang from their ambush and, chirruping something in their shrill<br>little voices and holding up their skirts, their bare little sunburned<br>feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass.<br><br>Prince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty<br>highroad along which the troops were moving. But not far from Bald Hills<br>he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting<br>place by the dam of a small pond. It was past one o’clock. The sun,<br>a red ball through the dust, burned and scorched his back intolerably<br>through his black coat. The dust always hung motionless above the buzz<br>of talk that came from the resting troops. There was no wind. As he<br>crossed the dam Prince Andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the<br>pond. He longed to get into that water, however dirty it might be, and<br>he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and<br>laughter. The small, muddy, green pond had risen visibly more than a<br>foot, flooding the dam, because it was full of the naked white bodies<br>of soldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing<br>about in it. All this naked white human flesh, laughing and shrieking,<br>floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering<br>can, and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered<br>it specially pathetic.<br><br>One fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince Andrew<br>knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed himself,<br>stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water; another,<br>a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood up to his<br>waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted<br>with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands<br>blackened to the wrists. There were sounds of men slapping one another,<br>yelling, and puffing.<br><br>Everywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was healthy,<br>white, muscular flesh. The officer, Timókhin, with his red little nose,<br>standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt confused at seeing<br>the prince, but made up his mind to address him nevertheless.<br><br>“It’s very nice, your excellency! Wouldn’t you like to?” said he.<br><br>“It’s dirty,” replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.<br><br>“We’ll clear it out for you in a minute,” said Timókhin, and, still<br>undressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.<br><br>“The prince wants to bathe.”<br><br>“What prince? Ours?” said many voices, and the men were in such haste<br>to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them. He decided that he<br>would rather wash himself with water in the barn.<br><br>“Flesh, bodies, cannon fodder!” he thought, and he looked at his own<br>naked body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust<br>and horror he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that<br>immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.<br><br><br>On the seventh of August Prince Bagratión wrote as follows from his<br>quarters at Mikháylovna on the Smolénsk road:<br><br>Dear Count Aléxis Andréevich—(He was writing to Arakchéev but knew that<br>his letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore weighed every<br>word in it to the best of his ability.)<br><br>I expect the Minister (Barclay de Tolly) has already reported the<br>abandonment of Smolénsk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and<br>the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been<br>wantonly abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most urgently<br>and finally wrote him, but nothing would induce him to consent. I swear<br>to you on my honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as never before and<br>might have lost half his army but could not have taken Smolénsk. Our<br>troops fought, and are fighting, as never before. With fifteen thousand<br>men I held the enemy at bay for thirty-five hours and beat him; but he<br>would not hold out even for fourteen hours. It is disgraceful, a stain<br>on our army, and as for him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If<br>he reports that our losses were great, it is not true; perhaps about<br>four thousand, not more, and not even that; but even were they ten<br>thousand, that’s war! But the enemy has lost masses....<br><br>What would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They would<br>have had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water for men<br>or horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but suddenly sent<br>instructions that he was retiring that night. We cannot fight in this<br>way, or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow....<br><br>There is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you<br>should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats! You<br>would set all Russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed<br>to wear the uniform. If it has come to this—we must fight as long as<br>Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand....<br><br>One man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister may perhaps<br>be good as a Minister, but as a general he is not merely bad but<br>execrable, yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country.... I<br>am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing boldly. It is clear<br>that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace, and that the<br>Minister should command the army, does not love our sovereign and<br>desires the ruin of us all. So I write you frankly: call out the<br>militia. For the Minister is leading these visitors after him to Moscow<br>in a most masterly way. The whole army feels great suspicion of the<br>Imperial aide-de-camp Wolzogen. He is said to be more Napoleon’s man<br>than ours, and he is always advising the Minister. I am not merely civil<br>to him but obey him like a corporal, though I am his senior. This is<br>painful, but, loving my benefactor and sovereign, I submit. Only I am<br>sorry for the Emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he.<br>Consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the<br>hospital more than fifteen thousand men, and had we attacked this would<br>not have happened. Tell me, for God’s sake, what will Russia, our mother<br>Russia, say to our being so frightened, and why are we abandoning our<br>good and gallant Fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of<br>hatred and shame in all our subjects? What are we scared at and of whom<br>are we afraid? I am not to blame that the Minister is vacillating,<br>a coward, dense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The whole army<br>bewails it and calls down curses upon him....<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>Among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human<br>life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails<br>and those in which form prevails. To the latter—as distinguished<br>from village, country, provincial, or even Moscow life—we may allot<br>Petersburg life, and especially the life of its salons. That life of<br>the salons is unchanging. Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had<br>again quarreled with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade<br>them again, but the salons of Anna Pávlovna and Hélène remained just<br>as they had been—the one seven and the other five years before. At Anna<br>Pávlovna’s they talked with perplexity of Bonaparte’s successes just<br>as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the<br>European sovereigns a malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was<br>to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna<br>Pávlovna was the representative. And in Hélène’s salon, which Rumyántsev<br>himself honored with his visits, regarding Hélène as a remarkably<br>intelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808<br>of the “great nation” and the “great man,” and regretted our rupture<br>with France, a rupture which, according to them, ought to be promptly<br>terminated by peace.<br><br>Of late, since the Emperor’s return from the army, there had been some<br>excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations<br>of hostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency.<br>In Anna Pávlovna’s circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were<br>deep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the<br>effect that one ought not to go to the French theater and that to<br>maintain the French troupe was costing the government as much as a whole<br>army corps. The progress of the war was eagerly followed, and only<br>the reports most flattering to our army were circulated. In the French<br>circle of Hélène and Rumyántsev the reports of the cruelty of the<br>enemy and of the war were contradicted and all Napoleon’s attempts at<br>conciliation were discussed. In that circle they discountenanced those<br>who advised hurried preparations for a removal to Kazán of the court and<br>the girls’ educational establishments under the patronage of the Dowager<br>Empress. In Hélène’s circle the war in general was regarded as a series<br>of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the<br>view prevailed expressed by Bilíbin—who now in Petersburg was quite at<br>home in Hélène’s house, which every clever man was obliged to visit—that<br>not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be<br>settled. In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm—news of which had reached<br>Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor’s return—was ridiculed<br>sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.<br><br>Anna Pávlovna’s circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm<br>and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients.<br>Prince Vasíli, who still occupied his former important posts, formed a<br>connecting link between these two circles. He visited his “good friend<br>Anna Pávlovna” as well as his daughter’s “diplomatic salon,” and often<br>in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused<br>and said at Hélène’s what he should have said at Anna Pávlovna’s and<br>vice versa.<br><br>Soon after the Emperor’s return Prince Vasíli in a conversation about<br>the war at Anna Pávlovna’s severely condemned Barclay de Tolly, but was<br>undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief. One of the<br>visitors, usually spoken of as “a man of great merit,” having described<br>how he had that day seen Kutúzov, the newly chosen chief of the<br>Petersburg militia, presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the<br>Treasury, cautiously ventured to suggest that Kutúzov would be the man<br>to satisfy all requirements.<br><br>Anna Pávlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kutúzov had done<br>nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.<br><br>“I have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility,” Prince<br>Vasíli interrupted, “but they did not listen to me. I told them his<br>election as chief of the militia would not please the Emperor. They did<br>not listen to me.<br><br>“It’s all this mania for opposition,” he went on. “And who for? It is<br>all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those Muscovites,”<br>Prince Vasíli continued, forgetting for a moment that though at Hélène’s<br>one had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna Pávlovna’s one had to<br>be ecstatic about it. But he retrieved his mistake at once. “Now, is<br>it suitable that Count Kutúzov, the oldest general in Russia, should<br>preside at that tribunal? He will get nothing for his pains! How could<br>they make a man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse, who drops<br>asleep at a council, and has the very worst morals! A good reputation<br>he made for himself at Bucharest! I don’t speak of his capacity as a<br>general, but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit, blind old<br>man, positively blind? A fine idea to have a blind general! He can’t see<br>anything. To play blindman’s buff? He can’t see at all!”<br><br>No one replied to his remarks.<br><br>This was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on the<br>twenty-ninth of July Kutúzov received the title of Prince. This might<br>indicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince Vasíli’s opinion<br>continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express<br>it. But on the eighth of August a committee, consisting of Field Marshal<br>Saltykóv, Arakchéev, Vyazmítinov, Lopukhín, and Kochubéy met to consider<br>the progress of the war. This committee came to the conclusion that<br>our failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the<br>members of the committee were aware of the Emperor’s dislike of Kutúzov,<br>after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as<br>commander in chief. That same day Kutúzov was appointed commander<br>in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region<br>occupied by them.<br><br>On the ninth of August Prince Vasíli at Anna Pávlovna’s again met the<br>“man of great merit.” The latter was very attentive to Anna Pávlovna<br>because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational<br>establishments for young ladies. Prince Vasíli entered the room with the<br>air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires.<br><br>“Well, have you heard the great news? Prince Kutúzov is field marshal!<br>All dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At last<br>we have a man!” said he, glancing sternly and significantly round at<br>everyone in the drawing room.<br><br>The “man of great merit,” despite his desire to obtain the post of<br>director, could not refrain from reminding Prince Vasíli of his former<br>opinion. Though this was impolite to Prince Vasíli in Anna Pávlovna’s<br>drawing room, and also to Anna Pávlovna herself who had received the<br>news with delight, he could not resist the temptation.<br><br>“But, Prince, they say he is blind!” said he, reminding Prince Vasíli of<br>his own words.<br><br>“Eh? Nonsense! He sees well enough,” said Prince Vasíli rapidly, in a<br>deep voice and with a slight cough—the voice and cough with which he was<br>wont to dispose of all difficulties.<br><br>“He sees well enough,” he added. “And what I am so pleased about,” he<br>went on, “is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all<br>the armies and the whole region—powers no commander in chief ever had<br>before. He is a second autocrat,” he concluded with a victorious smile.<br><br>“God grant it! God grant it!” said Anna Pávlovna.<br><br>The “man of great merit,” who was still a novice in court circles,<br>wishing to flatter Anna Pávlovna by defending her former position on<br>this question, observed:<br><br>“It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kutúzov those powers.<br>They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read, when he said to<br>Kutúzov: ‘Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you this honor.’”<br><br>“Perhaps the heart took no part in that speech,” said Anna Pávlovna.<br><br>“Oh, no, no!” warmly rejoined Prince Vasíli, who would not now yield<br>Kutúzov to anyone; in his opinion Kutúzov was not only admirable<br>himself, but was adored by everybody. “No, that’s impossible,” said he,<br>“for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before.”<br><br>“God grant only that Prince Kutúzov assumes real power and does not<br>allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel,” observed Anna Pávlovna.<br><br>Understanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vasíli said in a<br>whisper:<br><br>“I know for a fact that Kutúzov made it an absolute condition that the<br>Tsarévich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to the<br>Emperor?”<br><br>And Prince Vasíli repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by<br>Kutúzov to the Emperor. “I can neither punish him if he does wrong nor<br>reward him if he does right.”<br><br>“Oh, a very wise man is Prince Kutúzov! I have known him a long time!”<br><br>“They even say,” remarked the “man of great merit” who did not yet<br>possess courtly tact, “that his excellency made it an express condition<br>that the sovereign himself should not be with the army.”<br><br>As soon as he said this both Prince Vasíli and Anna Pávlovna turned away<br>from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naïveté.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>While this was taking place in Petersburg the French had already passed<br>Smolénsk and were drawing nearer and nearer to Moscow. Napoleon’s<br>historian Thiers, like other of his historians, trying to justify his<br>hero says that he was drawn to the walls of Moscow against his will. He<br>is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic<br>events in the will of one man; he is as right as the Russian historians<br>who maintain that Napoleon was drawn to Moscow by the skill of the<br>Russian commanders. Here besides the law of retrospection, which regards<br>all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur,<br>the law of reciprocity comes in, confusing the whole matter. A good<br>chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss<br>resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the<br>opening, but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar<br>mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect. He only notices the<br>mistake to which he pays attention, because his opponent took advantage<br>of it. How much more complex than this is the game of war, which<br>occurs under certain limits of time, and where it is not one will that<br>manipulates lifeless objects, but everything results from innumerable<br>conflicts of various wills!<br><br>After Smolénsk Napoleon sought a battle beyond Dorogobúzh at Vyázma, and<br>then at Tsárevo-Zaymíshche, but it happened that owing to a conjunction<br>of innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give battle till<br>they reached Borodinó, seventy miles from Moscow. From Vyázma Napoleon<br>ordered a direct advance on Moscow.<br><br>Moscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacrée des<br>peuples d’Alexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables églises en forme de<br>pagodes chinoises, * this Moscow gave Napoleon’s imagination no rest.<br>On the march from Vyázma to Tsárevo-Zaymíshche he rode his light bay<br>bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his pages,<br>and aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind to<br>question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by<br>Lelorgne d’Ideville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a gallop<br>and reined in his horse with an amused expression.<br><br>     * “Moscow, the Asiatic capital of this great empire, the<br>     sacred city of Alexander’s people, Moscow with its<br>     innumerable churches shaped like Chinese pagodas.”<br><br><br>“Well?” asked Napoleon.<br><br>“One of Plátov’s Cossacks says that Plátov’s corps is joining up with<br>the main army and that Kutúzov has been appointed commander in chief. He<br>is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.”<br><br>Napoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the<br>man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped<br>off, and an hour later, Lavrúshka, the serf Denísov had handed over<br>to Rostóv, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly’s jacket and on a French<br>cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face. Napoleon told him to ride<br>by his side and began questioning him.<br><br>“You are a Cossack?”<br><br>“Yes, a Cossack, your Honor.”<br><br>“The Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for Napoleon’s plain<br>appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental mind<br>the presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the<br>incidents of the war,” says Thiers, narrating this episode. In<br>reality Lavrúshka, having got drunk the day before and left his master<br>dinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of<br>chickens, where he engaged in looting till the French took him prisoner.<br>Lavrúshka was one of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who have seen all<br>sorts of things, consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and<br>cunning way, are ready to render any sort of service to their master,<br>and are keen at guessing their master’s baser impulses, especially those<br>prompted by vanity and pettiness.<br><br>Finding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had easily<br>and surely recognized, Lavrúshka was not in the least abashed but merely<br>did his utmost to gain his new master’s favor.<br><br>He knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon’s presence could<br>no more intimidate him than Rostóv’s, or a sergeant major’s with the<br>rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant major<br>or Napoleon could deprive him of.<br><br>So he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the<br>orderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the<br>Russians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, Lavrúshka screwed up<br>his eyes and considered.<br><br>In this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see cunning<br>in everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.<br><br>“It’s like this,” he said thoughtfully, “if there’s a battle soon, yours<br>will win. That’s right. But if three days pass, then after that, well,<br>then that same battle will not soon be over.”<br><br>Lelorgne d’Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon thus:<br>“If a battle takes place within the next three days the French will<br>win, but if later, God knows what will happen.” Napoleon did not smile,<br>though he was evidently in high good humor, and he ordered these words<br>to be repeated.<br><br>Lavrúshka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending not to<br>know who Napoleon was, added:<br><br>“We know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the<br>world, but we are a different matter...”—without knowing why or how this<br>bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.<br><br>The interpreter translated these words without the last phrase, and<br>Bonaparte smiled. “The young Cossack made his mighty interlocutor<br>smile,” says Thiers. After riding a few paces in silence, Napoleon<br>turned to Berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was<br>talking to the Emperor himself, to that very Emperor who had written his<br>immortally victorious name on the Pyramids, would affect this enfant du<br>Don. *<br><br>    * “Child of the Don.”<br><br><br>The fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavrúshka.<br><br>Lavrúshka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and that<br>Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new masters<br>promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his eyes<br>wide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be<br>whipped. “As soon as Napoleon’s interpreter had spoken,” says Thiers,<br>“the Cossack, seized by amazement, did not utter another word, but rode<br>on, his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across<br>the steppes of the East. All his loquacity was suddenly arrested and<br>replaced by a naïve and silent feeling of admiration. Napoleon, after<br>making the Cossack a present, had him set free like a bird restored to<br>its native fields.”<br><br>Napoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his<br>imagination, and “the bird restored to its native fields” galloped to<br>our outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that<br>he meant to relate to his comrades. What had really taken place he did<br>not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling. He<br>found the Cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating with Plátov’s<br>detachment and by evening found his master, Nicholas Rostóv, quartered<br>at Yankóvo. Rostóv was just mounting to go for a ride round the<br>neighboring villages with Ilyín; he let Lavrúshka have another horse and<br>took him along with him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>Princess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew<br>supposed.<br><br>After the return of Alpátych from Smolénsk the old prince suddenly<br>seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be called<br>up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the commander in<br>chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the<br>last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the commander in chief’s<br>discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills, where<br>one of Russia’s oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he<br>announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills.<br><br>But while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of<br>the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to Boguchárovo and<br>thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her father’s feverish and<br>sleepless activity after his previous apathy, could not bring herself to<br>leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey<br>him. She refused to go away and her father’s fury broke over her in a<br>terrible storm. He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on<br>her. Trying to convict her, he told her she had worn him out, had caused<br>his quarrel with his son, had harbored nasty suspicions of him, making<br>it the object of her life to poison his existence, and he drove her from<br>his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same<br>to him. He declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and<br>warned her not to dare to let him see her. The fact that he did not, as<br>she had feared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her<br>not to let him see her cheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof<br>that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and<br>had not gone away.<br><br>The morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince donned his<br>full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief. His calèche<br>was already at the door. Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in<br>his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his<br>armed peasants and domestic serfs. She sat by the window listening to<br>his voice which reached her from the garden. Suddenly several men came<br>running up the avenue with frightened faces.<br><br>Princess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered path, and<br>into the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving<br>toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by<br>the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and<br>decorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that<br>fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue,<br>could not be sure what change there was in his face. All she could see<br>was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one<br>of timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter he moved his helpless<br>lips and made a hoarse sound. It was impossible to make out what he<br>wanted. He was lifted up, carried to his study, and laid on the very<br>couch he had so feared of late.<br><br>The doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said that the<br>prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.<br><br>It was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and<br>next day they moved the prince to Boguchárovo, the doctor accompanying<br>him.<br><br>By the time they reached Boguchárovo, Dessalles and the little prince<br>had already left for Moscow.<br><br>For three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new<br>house Prince Andrew had built at Boguchárovo, ever in the same state,<br>getting neither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay like<br>a distorted corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and lips<br>twitching, and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was<br>going on around him or not. One thing was certain—that he was suffering<br>and wished to say something. But what it was, no one could tell: it<br>might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man, or it might relate<br>to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.<br><br>The doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due<br>to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell<br>her something, and the fact that her presence always increased his<br>restlessness confirmed her opinion.<br><br>He was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was no<br>hope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not do<br>to let him die on the road. “Would it not be better if the end did come,<br>the very end?” Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and day, hardly<br>sleeping at all, she watched him and, terrible to say, often watched<br>him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find<br>symptoms of the approach of the end.<br><br>Strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, yet<br>there it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was that since<br>her father’s illness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed with<br>him expecting something to happen), all the personal desires and hopes<br>that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened. Thoughts<br>that had not entered her mind for years—thoughts of a life free from<br>the fear of her father, and even the possibility of love and of family<br>happiness—floated continually in her imagination like temptations of the<br>devil. Thrust them aside as she would, questions continually recurred<br>to her as to how she would order her life now, after that. These were<br>temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew it. She knew that the<br>sole weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray. She assumed<br>an attitude of prayer, looked at the icons, repeated the words of a<br>prayer, but she could not pray. She felt that a different world had<br>now taken possession of her—the life of a world of strenuous and free<br>activity, quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she<br>had been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer.<br>She could not pray, could not weep, and worldly cares took possession of<br>her.<br><br>It was becoming dangerous to remain in Boguchárovo. News of the approach<br>of the French came from all sides, and in one village, ten miles from<br>Boguchárovo, a homestead had been looted by French marauders.<br><br>The doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the<br>provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary<br>to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of the<br>rural police having come to Boguchárovo urged the same thing, saying<br>that the French were only some twenty-five miles away, that French<br>proclamations were circulating in the villages, and that if the princess<br>did not take her father away before the fifteenth, he could not answer<br>for the consequences.<br><br>The princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares of preparation<br>and giving orders, for which everyone came to her, occupied her all day.<br>She spent the night of the fourteenth as usual, without undressing, in<br>the room next to the one where the prince lay. Several times, waking up,<br>she heard his groans and muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps<br>of Tíkhon and the doctor when they turned him over. Several times she<br>listened at the door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were<br>louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not<br>sleep and several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter<br>but not deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw<br>and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him.<br>She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she<br>sometimes involuntarily fixed on him. She knew that her going in during<br>the night at an unusual hour would irritate him.<br><br>But never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing<br>him. She recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his<br>found an expression of his love of her. Occasionally amid these memories<br>temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination: thoughts of<br>how things would be after his death, and how her new, liberated life<br>would be ordered. But she drove these thoughts away with disgust. Toward<br>morning he became quiet and she fell asleep.<br><br>She woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed her<br>clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father’s illness. On waking<br>she listened to what was going on behind the door and, hearing him<br>groan, said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same.<br><br>“But what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!” she<br>cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.<br><br>She washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the porch. In<br>front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed<br>into the vehicles.<br><br>It was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the porch, still<br>horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts<br>before going to her father. The doctor came downstairs and went out to<br>her.<br><br>“He is a little better today,” said he. “I was looking for you. One can<br>make out something of what he is saying. His head is clearer. Come in,<br>he is asking for you....”<br><br>Princess Mary’s heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale<br>and leaned against the wall to keep from falling. To see him, talk to<br>him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with<br>those dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment of joy and terror.<br><br>“Come,” said the doctor.<br><br>Princess Mary entered her father’s room and went up to his bed. He was<br>lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with<br>their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed<br>straight before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips<br>motionless. He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His face<br>seemed to have shriveled or melted; his features had grown smaller.<br>Princess Mary went up and kissed his hand. His left hand pressed hers<br>so that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come. He<br>twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered angrily.<br><br>She looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her. When<br>she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he<br>calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds. Then his lips<br>and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidly and<br>imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might not understand.<br><br>Straining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The comic<br>efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with<br>difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat. He said something,<br>repeating the same words several times. She could not understand them,<br>but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words<br>he uttered.<br><br>“Mmm...ar...ate...ate...” he repeated several times.<br><br>It was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor thought<br>he had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated: “Mary, are you afraid?”<br>The prince shook his head, again repeated the same sounds.<br><br>“My mind, my mind aches?” questioned Princess Mary.<br><br>He made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and<br>began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find<br>the right place for it.<br><br>“Always thoughts... about you... thoughts...” he then uttered much<br>more clearly than he had done before, now that he was sure of being<br>understood.<br><br>Princess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide her sobs<br>and tears.<br><br>He moved his hand over her hair.<br><br>“I have been calling you all night...” he brought out.<br><br>“If only I had known...” she said through her tears. “I was afraid to<br>come in.”<br><br>He pressed her hand.<br><br>“Weren’t you asleep?”<br><br>“No, I did not sleep,” said Princess Mary, shaking her head.<br><br>Unconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself as<br>he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed to move<br>with difficulty.<br><br>“Dear one... Dearest...” Princess Mary could not quite make out what he<br>had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender<br>caressing word such as he had never used to her before. “Why didn’t you<br>come in?”<br><br>“And I was wishing for his death!” thought Princess Mary.<br><br>He was silent awhile.<br><br>“Thank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!... thank<br>you!... forgive!... thank you!...” and tears began to flow from his<br>eyes. “Call Andrew!” he said suddenly, and a childish, timid expression<br>of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.<br><br>He himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least it<br>seemed to Princess Mary.<br><br>“I have a letter from him,” she replied.<br><br>He glanced at her with timid surprise.<br><br>“Where is he?”<br><br>“He’s with the army, Father, at Smolénsk.”<br><br>He closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as if in<br>answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and<br>remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.<br><br>“Yes,” he said, softly and distinctly. “Russia has perished. They’ve<br>destroyed her.”<br><br>And he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes. Princess Mary<br>could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face.<br><br>Again he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes, and<br>Tíkhon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.<br><br>Then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could<br>understand for a long time, till at last Tíkhon understood and repeated<br>it. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in<br>which he had just been speaking. She thought he was speaking of Russia,<br>or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson, or of his own death, and<br>so she could not guess his words.<br><br>“Put on your white dress. I like it,” was what he said.<br><br>Having understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the doctor<br>taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and trying to<br>persuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left the room the<br>prince again began speaking about his son, about the war, and about the<br>Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice, and<br>then he had a second and final stroke.<br><br>Princess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, it was hot and<br>sunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing and feel nothing,<br>except passionate love for her father, love such as she thought she had<br>never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing into the garden and as<br>far as the pond, along the avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had<br>planted.<br><br>“Yes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end<br>quicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will become of me? What<br>use will peace be when he is no longer here?” Princess Mary murmured,<br>pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom<br>which heaved with convulsive sobs.<br><br>When she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her<br>again to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne—who had remained<br>at Boguchárovo and did not wish to leave it—coming toward her with a<br>stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district, who<br>had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her<br>prompt departure. Princess Mary listened without understanding him; she<br>led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with him. Then,<br>excusing herself, she went to the door of the old prince’s room. The<br>doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter.<br><br>“Go away, Princess! Go away... go away!”<br><br>She returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the<br>slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know how<br>long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a woman’s<br>footsteps running along the path. She rose and saw Dunyásha her maid,<br>who was evidently looking for her, and who stopped suddenly as if in<br>alarm on seeing her mistress.<br><br>“Please come, Princess... The Prince,” said Dunyásha in a breaking<br>voice.<br><br>“Immediately, I’m coming, I’m coming!” replied the princess hurriedly,<br>not giving Dunyásha time to finish what she was saying, and trying to<br>avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.<br><br>“Princess, it’s God’s will! You must be prepared for everything,” said<br>the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.<br><br>“Let me alone; it’s not true!” she cried angrily to him.<br><br>The doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her<br>father’s door. “Why are these people with frightened faces stopping me?<br>I don’t want any of them! And what are they doing here?” she thought.<br>She opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened<br>room startled her. In the room were her nurse and other women. They all<br>drew back from the bed, making way for her. He was still lying on the<br>bed as before, but the stern expression of his quiet face made Princess<br>Mary stop short on the threshold.<br><br>“No, he’s not dead—it’s impossible!” she told herself and approached<br>him, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed her lips<br>to his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. All the force of the<br>tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was<br>replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her. “No, he<br>is no more! He is not, but here where he was is something unfamiliar and<br>hostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent mystery!” And hiding<br>her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor,<br>who held her up.<br><br><br>In the presence of Tíkhon and the doctor the women washed what had been<br>the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should<br>not stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied together the<br>legs that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed him in uniform<br>with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table.<br>Heaven only knows who arranged all this and when, but it all got done<br>as if of its own accord. Toward night candles were burning round his<br>coffin, a pall was spread over it, the floor was strewn with sprays of<br>juniper, a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head, and in a<br>corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms.<br><br>Just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the<br>inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round<br>the coffin—the Marshal, the village Elder, peasant women—and all with<br>fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and kissed the old<br>prince’s cold and stiffened hand.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>Until Prince Andrew settled in Boguchárovo its owners had always been<br>absentees, and its peasants were of quite a different character from<br>those of Bald Hills. They differed from them in speech, dress, and<br>disposition. They were called steppe peasants. The old prince used to<br>approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to Bald Hills<br>to help with the harvest or to dig ponds, and ditches, but he disliked<br>them for their boorishness.<br><br>Prince Andrew’s last stay at Boguchárovo, when he introduced hospitals<br>and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay, had not<br>softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in<br>them the traits of character the old prince called boorishness. Various<br>obscure rumors were always current among them: at one time a rumor that<br>they would all be enrolled as Cossacks; at another of a new religion to<br>which they were all to be converted; then of some proclamation of the<br>Tsar’s and of an oath to the Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connection with which<br>it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had<br>stopped it), then of Peter Fëdorovich’s return to the throne in seven<br>years’ time, when everything would be made free and so “simple” that<br>there would be no restrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte and<br>his invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague<br>notions of Antichrist, the end of the world, and “pure freedom.”<br><br>In the vicinity of Boguchárovo were large villages belonging to the<br>crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they<br>pleased. There were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood<br>and also very few domestic or literate serfs, and in the lives of the<br>peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of<br>the Russian people, the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to<br>contemporaries, were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among<br>others. One instance, which had occurred some twenty years before, was<br>a movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown “warm rivers.”<br>Hundreds of peasants, among them the Boguchárovo folk, suddenly began<br>selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast.<br>As birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea, so these men with their<br>wives and children streamed to the southeast, to parts where none of<br>them had ever been. They set off in caravans, bought their freedom one<br>by one or ran away, and drove or walked toward the “warm rivers.” Many<br>of them were punished, some sent to Siberia, many died of cold and<br>hunger on the road, many returned of their own accord, and the movement<br>died down of itself just as it had sprung up, without apparent reason.<br>But such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new<br>forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and<br>at the same time simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone<br>living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these<br>undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption.<br><br>Alpátych, who had reached Boguchárovo shortly before the old prince’s<br>death, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that contrary to<br>what was happening in the Bald Hills district, where over a radius of<br>forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages<br>to be devastated by the Cossacks, the peasants in the steppe region<br>round Boguchárovo were, it was rumored, in touch with the French,<br>received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand, and did not<br>migrate. He learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant<br>Karp, who possessed great influence in the village commune and had<br>recently been away driving a government transport, had returned with<br>news that the Cossacks were destroying deserted villages, but that the<br>French did not harm them. Alpátych also knew that on the previous day<br>another peasant had even brought from the village of Visloúkhovo, which<br>was occupied by the French, a proclamation by a French general that no<br>harm would be done to the inhabitants, and if they remained they would<br>be paid for anything taken from them. As proof of this the peasant had<br>brought from Visloúkhovo a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that<br>they were false) paid to him in advance for hay.<br><br>More important still, Alpátych learned that on the morning of the<br>very day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the<br>princess’ luggage from Boguchárovo, there had been a village meeting at<br>which it had been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no<br>time to waste. On the fifteenth, the day of the old prince’s death,<br>the Marshal had insisted on Princess Mary’s leaving at once, as it was<br>becoming dangerous. He had told her that after the sixteenth he could<br>not be responsible for what might happen. On the evening of the day the<br>old prince died the Marshal went away, promising to return next day for<br>the funeral. But this he was unable to do, for he received tidings that<br>the French had unexpectedly advanced, and had barely time to remove his<br>own family and valuables from his estate.<br><br>For some thirty years Boguchárovo had been managed by the village Elder,<br>Dron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive “Drónushka.”<br><br>Dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow<br>big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they<br>are sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth, as<br>straight and strong at sixty as at thirty.<br><br>Soon after the migration to the “warm rivers,” in which he had taken<br>part like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of<br>Boguchárovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably for<br>twenty-three years. The peasants feared him more than they did their<br>master. The masters, both the old prince and the young, and the steward<br>respected him and jestingly called him “the Minister.” During the<br>whole time of his service Dron had never been drunk or ill, never after<br>sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue,<br>and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money<br>account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless<br>cartloads he sold for the prince, nor a single shock of the whole corn<br>crop on any single acre of the Boguchárovo fields.<br><br>Alpátych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for his<br>Dron on the day of the prince’s funeral and told him to have twelve<br>horses got ready for the princess’ carriages and eighteen carts for<br>the things to be removed from Boguchárovo. Though the peasants paid<br>quitrent, Alpátych thought no difficulty would be made about complying<br>with this order, for there were two hundred and thirty households at<br>work in Boguchárovo and the peasants were well to do. But on hearing the<br>order Dron lowered his eyes and remained silent. Alpátych named certain<br>peasants he knew, from whom he told him to take the carts.<br><br>Dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting.<br>Alpátych named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no horses<br>available: some horses were carting for the government, others were too<br>weak, and others had died for want of fodder. It seemed that no horses<br>could be had even for the carriages, much less for the carting.<br><br>Alpátych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron was a model<br>village Elder, so Alpátych had not managed the prince’s estates for<br>twenty years in vain. He was a model steward, possessing in the highest<br>degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt<br>with. Having glanced at Dron he at once understood that his answers did<br>not express his personal views but the general mood of the Boguchárovo<br>commune, by which the Elder had already been carried away. But he also<br>knew that Dron, who had acquired property and was hated by the commune,<br>must be hesitating between the two camps: the masters’ and the serfs’.<br>He noticed this hesitation in Dron’s look and therefore frowned and<br>moved closer up to him.<br><br>“Now just listen, Drónushka,” said he. “Don’t talk nonsense to me. His<br>excellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people<br>away and not leave them with the enemy, and there is an order from the<br>Tsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar. Do you<br>hear?”<br><br>“I hear,” Dron answered without lifting his eyes.<br><br>Alpátych was not satisfied with this reply.<br><br>“Eh, Dron, it will turn out badly!” he said, shaking his head.<br><br>“The power is in your hands,” Dron rejoined sadly.<br><br>“Eh, Dron, drop it!” Alpátych repeated, withdrawing his hand from his<br>bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dron’s feet. “I can see<br>through you and three yards into the ground under you,” he continued,<br>gazing at the floor in front of Dron.<br><br>Dron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at Alpátych and again lowered<br>his eyes.<br><br>“You drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their<br>homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning<br>for the princess’ things. And don’t go to any meeting yourself, do you<br>hear?”<br><br>Dron suddenly fell on his knees.<br><br>“Yákov Alpátych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge me,<br>for Christ’s sake!”<br><br>“Stop that!” cried Alpátych sternly. “I see through you and three yards<br>under you,” he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping, his<br>knowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that he had<br>been able to retain the old prince’s favor for twenty years had long<br>since gained him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the power of<br>seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards.<br><br>Dron got up and was about to say something, but Alpátych interrupted<br>him.<br><br>“What is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What are you thinking<br>of, eh?”<br><br>“What am I to do with the people?” said Dron. “They’re quite beside<br>themselves; I have already told them...”<br><br>“‘Told them,’ I dare say!” said Alpátych. “Are they drinking?” he asked<br>abruptly.<br><br>“Quite beside themselves, Yákov Alpátych; they’ve fetched another<br>barrel.”<br><br>“Well, then, listen! I’ll go to the police officer, and you tell them<br>so, and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready.”<br><br>“I understand.”<br><br>Alpátych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long time<br>and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion<br>that they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive “I understand”<br>from Dron, Alpátych contented himself with that, though he not only<br>doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the<br>carts would not be forthcoming.<br><br>And so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided. In the<br>village, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being held, which<br>decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the<br>carts should not be provided. Without saying anything of this to the<br>princess, Alpátych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which<br>had arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready for<br>the princess’ carriages. Meanwhile he went himself to the police<br>authorities.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>After her father’s funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and<br>did not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that Alpátych was<br>asking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk with<br>Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been<br>lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go<br>away and begged to be left in peace.<br><br>The windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward. She<br>lay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons of the<br>leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her confused<br>thoughts were centered on one subject—the irrevocability of death and<br>her own spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected, but which had<br>shown itself during her father’s illness. She wished to pray but did not<br>dare to, dared not in her present state of mind address herself to God.<br>She lay for a long time in that position.<br><br>The sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting rays<br>shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of the morocco<br>cushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of her thoughts<br>suddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed her hair, got up,<br>and went to the window, involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the<br>clear but windy evening.<br><br>“Yes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone and no one will<br>hinder you,” she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her<br>head fall on the window sill.<br><br>Someone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and<br>kissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a black<br>dress and weepers. She softly approached Princess Mary, sighed, kissed<br>her, and immediately began to cry. The princess looked up at her. All<br>their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind.<br>But she remembered too how he had changed of late toward Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne and could not bear to see her, thereby showing how unjust were<br>the reproaches Princess Mary had mentally addressed to her. “Besides,<br>is it for me, for me who desired his death, to condemn anyone?” she<br>thought.<br><br>Princess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, but who yet was<br>dependent on her and living in her house. She felt sorry for her<br>and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry. Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand, speaking of<br>the princess’ sorrow and making herself a partner in it. She said her<br>only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her<br>sorrow, that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but<br>this great grief; that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone,<br>and that he, from above, saw her affection and gratitude. The princess<br>heard her, not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and<br>listening to the sound of her voice.<br><br>“Your position is doubly terrible, dear princess,” said Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne after a pause. “I understand that you could not, and cannot,<br>think of yourself, but with my love for you I must do so.... Has<br>Alpátych been to you? Has he spoken to you of going away?” she asked.<br><br>Princess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was to go or<br>where to. “Is it possible to plan or think of anything now? Is it not<br>all the same?” she thought, and did not reply.<br><br>“You know, chère Marie,” said Mademoiselle Bourienne, “that we are in<br>danger—are surrounded by the French. It would be dangerous to move now.<br>If we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God knows...”<br><br>Princess Mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was<br>talking about.<br><br>“Oh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now,” she said.<br>“Of course I would on no account wish to go away from him.... Alpátych<br>did say something about going.... Speak to him; I can do nothing,<br>nothing, and don’t want to....”<br><br>“I’ve spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow,<br>but I think it would now be better to stay here,” said Mademoiselle<br>Bourienne. “Because, you will agree, chère Marie, to fall into the hands<br>of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible.”<br><br>Mademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not<br>printed on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameau’s, telling people<br>not to leave their homes and that the French authorities would afford<br>them proper protection. She handed this to the princess.<br><br>“I think it would be best to appeal to that general,” she continued,<br>“and I am sure that all due respect would be shown you.”<br><br>Princess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with stifled<br>sobs.<br><br>“From whom did you get this?” she asked.<br><br>“They probably recognized that I am French, by my name,” replied<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne blushing.<br><br>Princess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window and with<br>a pale face went out of the room and into what had been Prince Andrew’s<br>study.<br><br>“Dunyásha, send Alpátych, or Drónushka, or somebody to me!” she said,<br>“and tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not to come to me,” she added, hearing<br>Mademoiselle Bourienne’s voice. “We must go at once, at once!” she said,<br>appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the French.<br><br>“If Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the French! That<br>I, the daughter of Prince Nicholas Bolkónski, asked General Rameau for<br>protection and accepted his favor!” This idea horrified her, made her<br>shudder, blush, and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never<br>experienced before. All that was distressing, and especially all that<br>was humiliating, in her position rose vividly to her mind. “They, the<br>French, would settle in this house: M. le Général Rameau would occupy<br>Prince Andrew’s study and amuse himself by looking through and reading<br>his letters and papers. Mademoiselle Bourienne would do the honors of<br>Boguchárovo for him. I should be given a small room as a favor, the<br>soldiers would violate my father’s newly dug grave to steal his crosses<br>and stars, they would tell me of their victories over the Russians, and<br>would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow...” thought Princess Mary,<br>not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father<br>and her brother. For herself she did not care where she remained or what<br>happened to her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead<br>father and of Prince Andrew. Involuntarily she thought their thoughts<br>and felt their feelings. What they would have said and what they would<br>have done she felt bound to say and do. She went into Prince Andrew’s<br>study, trying to enter completely into his ideas, and considered her<br>position.<br><br>The demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her father’s<br>death, all at once rose before her with a new, previously unknown force<br>and took possession of her.<br><br>Agitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael<br>Ivánovich and now for Tíkhon or Dron. Dunyásha, the nurse, and the other<br>maids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienne’s statement was<br>correct. Alpátych was not at home, he had gone to the police. Neither<br>could the architect Michael Ivánovich, who on being sent for came in<br>with sleepy eyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With just the same smile<br>of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to<br>answer the old prince without expressing views of his own, he now<br>replied to Princess Mary, so that nothing definite could be got from his<br>answers. The old valet Tíkhon, with sunken, emaciated face that bore the<br>stamp of inconsolable grief, replied: “Yes, Princess” to all Princess<br>Mary’s questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her.<br><br>At length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with a deep bow<br>to Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.<br><br>Princess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him.<br><br>“Drónushka,” she said, regarding as a sure friend this Drónushka who<br>always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the<br>fair at Vyázma every year and smilingly offer it to her, “Drónushka, now<br>since our misfortune...” she began, but could not go on.<br><br>“We are all in God’s hands,” said he, with a sigh.<br><br>They were silent for a while.<br><br>“Drónushka, Alpátych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to turn<br>to. Is it true, as they tell me, that I can’t even go away?”<br><br>“Why shouldn’t you go away, your excellency? You can go,” said Dron.<br><br>“I was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend, I<br>can do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want to go away<br>tonight or early tomorrow morning.”<br><br>Dron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: “There are no<br>horses; I told Yákov Alpátych so.”<br><br>“Why are there none?” asked the princess.<br><br>“It’s all God’s scourge,” said Dron. “What horses we had have been<br>taken for the army or have died—this is such a year! It’s not a case of<br>feeding horses—we may die of hunger ourselves! As it is, some go three<br>days without eating. We’ve nothing, we’ve been ruined.”<br><br>Princess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.<br><br>“The peasants are ruined? They have no bread?” she asked.<br><br>“They’re dying of hunger,” said Dron. “It’s not a case of carting.”<br><br>“But why didn’t you tell me, Drónushka? Isn’t it possible to help them?<br>I’ll do all I can....”<br><br>To Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such sorrow<br>was filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor, and the rich<br>could refrain from helping the poor. She had heard vaguely that there<br>was such a thing as “landlord’s corn” which was sometimes given to the<br>peasants. She also knew that neither her father nor her brother would<br>refuse to help the peasants in need, she only feared to make some<br>mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to<br>give. She was glad such cares presented themselves, enabling her<br>without scruple to forget her own grief. She began asking Dron about the<br>peasants’ needs and what there was in Boguchárovo that belonged to the<br>landlord.<br><br>“But we have grain belonging to my brother?” she said.<br><br>“The landlord’s grain is all safe,” replied Dron proudly. “Our prince<br>did not order it to be sold.”<br><br>“Give it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you leave<br>in my brother’s name,” said she.<br><br>Dron made no answer but sighed deeply.<br><br>“Give them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute it all. I<br>give this order in my brother’s name; and tell them that what is ours is<br>theirs. We do not grudge them anything. Tell them so.”<br><br>Dron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.<br><br>“Discharge me, little mother, for God’s sake! Order the keys to be taken<br>from me,” said he. “I have served twenty-three years and have done no<br>wrong. Discharge me, for God’s sake!”<br><br>Princess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was<br>asking to be discharged. She replied that she had never doubted his<br>devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the<br>peasants.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>An hour later Dunyásha came to tell the princess that Dron had come, and<br>all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess’ order and<br>wished to have word with their mistress.<br><br>“But I never told them to come,” said Princess Mary. “I only told Dron<br>to let them have the grain.”<br><br>“Only, for God’s sake, Princess dear, have them sent away and don’t go<br>out to them. It’s all a trick,” said Dunyásha, “and when Yákov Alpátych<br>returns let us get away... and please don’t...”<br><br>“What is a trick?” asked Princess Mary in surprise.<br><br>“I know it is, only listen to me for God’s sake! Ask nurse too. They say<br>they don’t agree to leave Boguchárovo as you ordered.”<br><br>“You’re making some mistake. I never ordered them to go away,” said<br>Princess Mary. “Call Drónushka.”<br><br>Dron came and confirmed Dunyásha’s words; the peasants had come by the<br>princess’ order.<br><br>“But I never sent for them,” declared the princess. “You must have given<br>my message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the grain.”<br><br>Dron only sighed in reply.<br><br>“If you order it they will go away,” said he.<br><br>“No, no. I’ll go out to them,” said Princess Mary, and in spite of<br>the nurse’s and Dunyásha’s protests she went out into the porch; Dron,<br>Dunyásha, the nurse, and Michael Ivánovich following her.<br><br>“They probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to<br>remain here, while I myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the<br>French,” thought Princess Mary. “I will offer them monthly rations and<br>housing at our Moscow estate. I am sure Andrew would do even more in<br>my place,” she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd<br>standing on the pasture by the barn.<br><br>The men crowded closer together, stirred, and rapidly took off their<br>hats. Princess Mary lowered her eyes and, tripping over her skirt, came<br>close up to them. So many different eyes, old and young, were fixed<br>on her, and there were so many different faces, that she could not<br>distinguish any of them and, feeling that she must speak to them all<br>at once, did not know how to do it. But again the sense that she<br>represented her father and her brother gave her courage, and she boldly<br>began her speech.<br><br>“I am very glad you have come,” she said without raising her eyes, and<br>feeling her heart beating quickly and violently. “Drónushka tells me<br>that the war has ruined you. That is our common misfortune, and I<br>shall grudge nothing to help you. I am myself going away because it<br>is dangerous here... the enemy is near... because... I am giving you<br>everything, my friends, and I beg you to take everything, all our grain,<br>so that you may not suffer want! And if you have been told that I am<br>giving you the grain to keep you here—that is not true. On the contrary,<br>I ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near Moscow, and<br>I promise you I will see to it that there you shall want for nothing.<br>You shall be given food and lodging.”<br><br>The princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.<br><br>“I am not doing this on my own account,” she continued, “I do it in the<br>name of my dead father, who was a good master to you, and of my brother<br>and his son.”<br><br>Again she paused. No one broke the silence.<br><br>“Ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together. All that is<br>mine is yours,” she concluded, scanning the faces before her.<br><br>All eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression. She<br>could not fathom whether it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or<br>apprehension and distrust—but the expression on all the faces was<br>identical.<br><br>“We are all very thankful for your bounty, but it won’t do for us to<br>take the landlord’s grain,” said a voice at the back of the crowd.<br><br>“But why not?” asked the princess.<br><br>No one replied and Princess Mary, looking round at the crowd, found that<br>every eye she met now was immediately dropped.<br><br>“But why don’t you want to take it?” she asked again.<br><br>No one answered.<br><br>The silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch<br>someone’s eye.<br><br>“Why don’t you speak?” she inquired of a very old man who stood just<br>in front of her leaning on his stick. “If you think something more is<br>wanted, tell me! I will do anything,” said she, catching his eye.<br><br>But as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:<br><br>“Why should we agree? We don’t want the grain.”<br><br>“Why should we give up everything? We don’t agree. Don’t agree.... We<br>are sorry for you, but we’re not willing. Go away yourself, alone...”<br>came from various sides of the crowd.<br><br>And again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression,<br>though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude,<br>but of angry resolve.<br><br>“But you can’t have understood me,” said Princess Mary with a sad smile.<br>“Why don’t you want to go? I promise to house and feed you, while here<br>the enemy would ruin you....”<br><br>But her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd.<br><br>“We’re not willing. Let them ruin us! We won’t take your grain. We don’t<br>agree.”<br><br>Again Princess Mary tried to catch someone’s eye, but not a single eye<br>in the crowd was turned to her; evidently they were all trying to avoid<br>her look. She felt strange and awkward.<br><br>“Oh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your houses<br>and go into bondage! I dare say! ‘I’ll give you grain, indeed!’ she<br>says,” voices in the crowd were heard saying.<br><br>With drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the<br>house. Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for her<br>departure next morning, she went to her room and remained alone with her<br>own thoughts.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>For a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of her<br>room hearing the sound of the peasants’ voices that reached her from<br>the village, but it was not of them she was thinking. She felt that she<br>could not understand them however much she might think about them. She<br>thought only of one thing, her sorrow, which, after the break caused<br>by cares for the present, seemed already to belong to the past. Now she<br>could remember it and weep or pray.<br><br>After sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and fresh. Toward<br>midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full moon began<br>to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist began to<br>rise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house.<br><br>Pictures of the near past—her father’s illness and last moments—rose<br>one after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now lingered<br>over these images, repelling with horror only the last one, the<br>picture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate even in<br>imagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And these pictures<br>presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they<br>seemed now present, now past, and now future.<br><br>She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was<br>being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills,<br>muttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray<br>eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her.<br><br>“Even then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died,” she<br>thought. “He had always thought what he said then.” And she recalled in<br>all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke,<br>when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his<br>will. She had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe, and going<br>to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened<br>at the door. In a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to<br>Tíkhon, speaking of the Crimea and its warm nights and of the Empress.<br>Evidently he had wanted to talk. “And why didn’t he call me? Why didn’t<br>he let me be there instead of Tíkhon?” Princess Mary had thought and<br>thought again now. “Now he will never tell anyone what he had in his<br>soul. Never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have<br>said all he longed to say, and not Tíkhon but I might have heard and<br>understood him. Why didn’t I enter the room?” she thought. “Perhaps he<br>would then have said to me what he said the day he died. While talking<br>to Tíkhon he asked about me twice. He wanted to see me, and I was<br>standing close by, outside the door. It was sad and painful for him<br>to talk to Tíkhon who did not understand him. I remember how he began<br>speaking to him about Lise as if she were alive—he had forgotten she<br>was dead—and Tíkhon reminded him that she was no more, and he shouted,<br>‘Fool!’ He was greatly depressed. From behind the door I heard how he<br>lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed, ‘My God!’ Why didn’t<br>I go in then? What could he have done to me? What could I have lost? And<br>perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word<br>to me.” And Princess Mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said<br>to her on the day of his death. “Dear-est!” she repeated, and began<br>sobbing, with tears that relieved her soul. She now saw his face before<br>her. And not the face she had known ever since she could remember and<br>had always seen at a distance, but the timid, feeble face she had seen<br>for the first time quite closely, with all its wrinkles and details,<br>when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said.<br><br>“Dear-est!” she repeated again.<br><br>“What was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking<br>now?” This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer she<br>saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay<br>in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief. And the<br>horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself<br>that that was not he, but something mysterious and horrible, seized her<br>again. She tried to think of something else and to pray, but could do<br>neither. With wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows,<br>expecting every moment to see his dead face, and she felt that the<br>silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast.<br><br>“Dunyásha,” she whispered. “Dunyásha!” she screamed wildly, and tearing<br>herself out of this silence she ran to the servants’ quarters to meet<br>her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>On the seventeenth of August Rostóv and Ilyín, accompanied by Lavrúshka<br>who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly, left<br>their quarters at Yankóvo, ten miles from Boguchárovo, and went for a<br>ride—to try a new horse Ilyín had bought and to find out whether there<br>was any hay to be had in the villages.<br><br>For the last three days Boguchárovo had lain between the two hostile<br>armies, so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard to get to it as<br>for the French vanguard; Rostóv, as a careful squadron commander, wished<br>to take such provisions as remained at Boguchárovo before the French<br>could get them.<br><br>Rostóv and Ilyín were in the merriest of moods. On the way to<br>Boguchárovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where<br>they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they questioned<br>Lavrúshka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and raced one<br>another to try Ilyín’s horse.<br><br>Rostóv had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of<br>that very Bolkónski who had been engaged to his sister.<br><br>Rostóv and Ilyín gave rein to their horses for a last race along the<br>incline before reaching Boguchárovo, and Rostóv, outstripping Ilyín, was<br>the first to gallop into the village street.<br><br>“You’re first!” cried Ilyín, flushed.<br><br>“Yes, always first both on the grassland and here,” answered Rostóv,<br>stroking his heated Donéts horse.<br><br>“And I’d have won on my Frenchy, your excellency,” said Lavrúshka<br>from behind, alluding to his shabby cart horse, “only I didn’t wish to<br>mortify you.”<br><br>They rode at a footpace to the barn, where a large crowd of peasants was<br>standing.<br><br>Some of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new arrivals<br>without doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces<br>and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and<br>singing some incoherent song, and approached the officers.<br><br>“Fine fellows!” said Rostóv laughing. “Is there any hay here?”<br><br>“And how like one another,” said Ilyín.<br><br>“A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!” sang one of the peasants with a<br>blissful smile.<br><br>One of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rostóv.<br><br>“Who do you belong to?” he asked.<br><br>“The French,” replied Ilyín jestingly, “and here is Napoleon<br>himself”—and he pointed to Lavrúshka.<br><br>“Then you are Russians?” the peasant asked again.<br><br>“And is there a large force of you here?” said another, a short man,<br>coming up.<br><br>“Very large,” answered Rostóv. “But why have you collected here?” he<br>added. “Is it a holiday?”<br><br>“The old men have met to talk over the business of the commune,” replied<br>the peasant, moving away.<br><br>At that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women and a<br>man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.<br><br>“The one in pink is mine, so keep off!” said Ilyín on seeing Dunyásha<br>running resolutely toward him.<br><br>“She’ll be ours!” said Lavrúshka to Ilyín, winking.<br><br>“What do you want, my pretty?” said Ilyín with a smile.<br><br>“The princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name.”<br><br>“This is Count Rostóv, squadron commander, and I am your humble<br>servant.”<br><br>“Co-o-om-pa-ny!” roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as<br>he looked at Ilyín talking to the girl. Following Dunyásha, Alpátych<br>advanced to Rostóv, having bared his head while still at a distance.<br><br>“May I make bold to trouble your honor?” said he respectfully, but with<br>a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand<br>thrust into his bosom. “My mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince<br>Nicholas Bolkónski who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding<br>herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people”—he<br>pointed to the peasants—“asks you to come up to the house.... Won’t<br>you, please, ride on a little farther,” said Alpátych with a melancholy<br>smile, “as it is not convenient in the presence of...?” He pointed to<br>the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse.<br><br>“Ah!... Alpátych... Ah, Yákov Alpátych... Grand! Forgive us for Christ’s<br>sake, eh?” said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.<br><br>Rostóv looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.<br><br>“Or perhaps they amuse your honor?” remarked Alpátych with a staid air,<br>as he pointed at the old men with his free hand.<br><br>“No, there’s not much to be amused at here,” said Rostóv, and rode on a<br>little way. “What’s the matter?” he asked.<br><br>“I make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here don’t<br>wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness her<br>horses, so that though everything has been packed up since morning, her<br>excellency cannot get away.”<br><br>“Impossible!” exclaimed Rostóv.<br><br>“I have the honor to report to you the actual truth,” said Alpátych.<br><br>Rostóv dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed Alpátych<br>to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs. It appeared<br>that the princess’ offer of corn to the peasants the previous day, and<br>her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect<br>that Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had<br>not appeared when Alpátych sent for him; and that in the morning when<br>the princess gave orders to harness for her journey, the peasants had<br>come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let<br>her leave the village: that there was an order not to move, and that<br>they would unharness the horses. Alpátych had gone out to admonish them,<br>but was told (it was chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing<br>himself in the crowd) that they could not let the princess go, that<br>there was an order to the contrary, but that if she stayed they would<br>serve her as before and obey her in everything.<br><br>At the moment when Rostóv and Ilyín were galloping along the road,<br>Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alpátych, her nurse, and the<br>maids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the<br>cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran<br>away, and the women in the house began to wail.<br><br>“Father! Benefactor! God has sent you!” exclaimed deeply moved voices as<br>Rostóv passed through the anteroom.<br><br>Princess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting<br>room, when Rostóv was shown in. She could not grasp who he was and why<br>he had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his Russian<br>face, and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a<br>man of her own class, she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and<br>began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion. This<br>meeting immediately struck Rostóv as a romantic event. “A helpless girl<br>overwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants!<br>And what a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility there<br>are in her features and expression!” thought he as he looked at her and<br>listened to her timid story.<br><br>When she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her<br>father’s funeral, her voice trembled. She turned away, and then, as if<br>fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at<br>him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears in Rostóv’s<br>eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that<br>radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten.<br><br>“I cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride here<br>and am able to show my readiness to serve you,” said Rostóv, rising. “Go<br>when you please, and I give you my word of honor that no one shall dare<br>to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort.”<br>And bowing respectfully, as if to a lady of royal blood, he moved toward<br>the door.<br><br>Rostóv’s deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would<br>consider himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did not wish to<br>take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her.<br><br>Princess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.<br><br>“I am very, very grateful to you,” she said in French, “but I hope it<br>was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.” She<br>suddenly began to cry.<br><br>“Excuse me!” she said.<br><br>Rostóv, knitting his brows, left the room with another low bow.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>“Well, is she pretty? Ah, friend—my pink one is delicious; her name is<br>Dunyásha....”<br><br>But on glancing at Rostóv’s face Ilyín stopped short. He saw that his<br>hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought.<br><br>Rostóv glanced angrily at Ilyín and without replying strode off with<br>rapid steps to the village.<br><br>“I’ll show them; I’ll give it to them, the brigands!” said he to<br>himself.<br><br>Alpátych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up with<br>him with difficulty.<br><br>“What decision have you been pleased to come to?” said he.<br><br>Rostóv stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned on<br>Alpátych.<br><br>“Decision? What decision? Old dotard!...” cried he. “What have you been<br>about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you can’t manage them? You’re<br>a traitor yourself! I know you. I’ll flay you all alive!...” And as if<br>afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left Alpátych and went rapidly<br>forward. Alpátych, mastering his offended feelings, kept pace with<br>Rostóv at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views. He said<br>the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be<br>imprudent to “overresist” them without an armed force, and would it not<br>be better first to send for the military?<br><br>“I’ll give them armed force... I’ll ‘overresist’ them!” uttered Rostóv<br>meaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to<br>vent it.<br><br>Without considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick,<br>resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it the more<br>Alpátych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results.<br>The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw<br>Rostóv’s rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face.<br><br>After the hussars had come to the village and Rostóv had gone to see the<br>princess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd.<br>Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were Russians and<br>might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained. Dron was of<br>this opinion, but as soon as he expressed it Karp and others attacked<br>their ex-Elder.<br><br>“How many years have you been fattening on the commune?” Karp shouted at<br>him. “It’s all one to you! You’ll dig up your pot of money and take<br>it away with you.... What does it matter to you whether our homes are<br>ruined or not?”<br><br>“We’ve been told to keep order, and that no one is to leave their homes<br>or take away a single grain, and that’s all about it!” cried another.<br><br>“It was your son’s turn to be conscripted, but no fear! You begrudged<br>your lump of a son,” a little old man suddenly began attacking Dron—“and<br>so they took my Vánka to be shaved for a soldier! But we all have to<br>die.”<br><br>“To be sure, we all have to die. I’m not against the commune,” said<br>Dron.<br><br>“That’s it—not against it! You’ve filled your belly....”<br><br>The two tall peasants had their say. As soon as Rostóv, followed by<br>Ilyín, Lavrúshka, and Alpátych, came up to the crowd, Karp, thrusting<br>his fingers into his belt and smiling a little, walked to the front.<br>Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer<br>together.<br><br>“Who is your Elder here? Hey?” shouted Rostóv, coming up to the crowd<br>with quick steps.<br><br>“The Elder? What do you want with him?...” asked Karp.<br><br>But before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew off and a<br>fierce blow jerked his head to one side.<br><br>“Caps off, traitors!” shouted Rostóv in a wrathful voice. “Where’s the<br>Elder?” he cried furiously.<br><br>“The Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron Zakhárych, you!” meek and<br>flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to<br>come off their heads.<br><br>“We don’t riot, we’re following the orders,” declared Karp, and at that<br>moment several voices began speaking together.<br><br>“It’s as the old men have decided—there’s too many of you giving<br>orders.”<br><br>“Arguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!” cried Rostóv unmeaningly in a<br>voice not his own, gripping Karp by the collar. “Bind him, bind him!” he<br>shouted, though there was no one to bind him but Lavrúshka and Alpátych.<br><br>Lavrúshka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from<br>behind.<br><br>“Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?” he called out.<br><br>Alpátych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come<br>and bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking<br>off their belts.<br><br>“Where’s the Elder?” demanded Rostóv in a loud voice.<br><br>With a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.<br><br>“Are you the Elder? Bind him, Lavrúshka!” shouted Rostóv, as if that<br>order, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.<br><br>And in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his own<br>belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.<br><br>“And you all listen to me!” said Rostóv to the peasants. “Be off to your<br>houses at once, and don’t let one of your voices be heard!”<br><br>“Why, we’ve not done any harm! We did it just out of foolishness. It’s<br>all nonsense.... I said then that it was not in order,” voices were<br>heard bickering with one another.<br><br>“There! What did I say?” said Alpátych, coming into his own again. “It’s<br>wrong, lads!”<br><br>“All our stupidity, Yákov Alpátych,” came the answers, and the crowd<br>began at once to disperse through the village.<br><br>The two bound men were led off to the master’s house. The two drunken<br>peasants followed them.<br><br>“Aye, when I look at you!...” said one of them to Karp.<br><br>“How can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking of,<br>you fool?” added the other—“A real fool!”<br><br>Two hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the<br>Boguchárovo house. The peasants were briskly carrying out the<br>proprietor’s goods and packing them on the carts, and Dron, liberated at<br>Princess Mary’s wish from the cupboard where he had been confined, was<br>standing in the yard directing the men.<br><br>“Don’t put it in so carelessly,” said one of the peasants, a man with a<br>round smiling face, taking a casket from a housemaid. “You know it has<br>cost money! How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord<br>where it’ll get rubbed? I don’t like that way of doing things. Let it<br>all be done properly, according to rule. Look here, put it under the<br>bast matting and cover it with hay—that’s the way!”<br><br>“Eh, books, books!” said another peasant, bringing out Prince Andrew’s<br>library cupboards. “Don’t catch up against it! It’s heavy, lads—solid<br>books.”<br><br>“Yes, they worked all day and didn’t play!” remarked the tall,<br>round-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the<br>dictionaries that were on the top.<br><br><br>Unwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, Rostóv did not go back to<br>the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure. When her<br>carriage drove out of the house, he mounted and accompanied her eight<br>miles from Boguchárovo to where the road was occupied by our troops. At<br>the inn at Yankóvo he respectfully took leave of her, for the first time<br>permitting himself to kiss her hand.<br><br>“How can you speak so!” he blushingly replied to Princess Mary’s<br>expressions of gratitude for her deliverance, as she termed what had<br>occurred. “Any police officer would have done as much! If we had had<br>only peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,”<br>said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. “I<br>am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance.<br>Good-by, Princess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet<br>you again in happier circumstances. If you don’t want to make me blush,<br>please don’t thank me!”<br><br>But the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked<br>him with the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude and<br>tenderness. She could not believe that there was nothing to thank him<br>for. On the contrary, it seemed to her certain that had he not been<br>there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the<br>French, and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger<br>to save her, and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and<br>noble soul, able to understand her position and her sorrow. His kind,<br>honest eyes, with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to<br>cry as she spoke of her loss, did not leave her memory.<br><br>When she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt<br>her eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the strange<br>question presented itself to her: did she love him?<br><br>On the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princess’ position was not<br>a cheerful one, Dunyásha, who went with her in the carriage, more than<br>once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at<br>something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow.<br><br>“Well, supposing I do love him?” thought Princess Mary.<br><br>Ashamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in<br>love with a man who would perhaps never love her, she comforted herself<br>with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not<br>be to blame if, without ever speaking of it to anyone, she continued to<br>the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for<br>the first and last time in her life.<br><br>Sometimes when she recalled his looks, his sympathy, and his words,<br>happiness did not appear impossible to her. It was at those moments that<br>Dunyásha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window.<br><br>“Was it not fate that brought him to Boguchárovo, and at that very<br>moment?” thought Princess Mary. “And that caused his sister to refuse my<br>brother?” And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of Providence.<br><br>The impression the princess made on Rostóv was a very agreeable one. To<br>remember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, hearing of his<br>adventure at Boguchárovo, rallied him on having gone to look for hay<br>and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he grew<br>angry. It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle<br>Princess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune,<br>had against his will more than once entered his head. For himself<br>personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by marrying her<br>he would make the countess his mother happy, would be able to put his<br>father’s affairs in order, and would even—he felt it—ensure Princess<br>Mary’s happiness.<br><br>But Sónya? And his plighted word? That was why Rostóv grew angry when he<br>was rallied about Princess Bolkónskaya.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>On receiving command of the armies Kutúzov remembered Prince Andrew and<br>sent an order for him to report at headquarters.<br><br>Prince Andrew arrived at Tsárevo-Zaymíshche on the very day and at the<br>very hour that Kutúzov was reviewing the troops for the first time. He<br>stopped in the village at the priest’s house in front of which stood the<br>commander in chief’s carriage, and he sat down on the bench at the gate<br>awaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now called Kutúzov. From the<br>field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the<br>roar of many voices shouting “Hurrah!” to the new commander in chief.<br>Two orderlies, a courier and a major-domo, stood near by, some ten paces<br>from Prince Andrew, availing themselves of Kutúzov’s absence and of the<br>fine weather. A short, swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick<br>mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince<br>Andrew, inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and<br>whether he would soon be back.<br><br>Prince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness’ staff<br>but was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned to a smart<br>orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in<br>chief’s orderly speaks to officers, replied:<br><br>“What? His Serene Highness? I expect he’ll be here soon. What do you<br>want?”<br><br>The lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the<br>orderly’s tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and<br>approached Bolkónski with a slight bow. Bolkónski made room for him on<br>the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.<br><br>“You’re also waiting for the commander in chief?” said he. “They say he<br>weceives evewyone, thank God!... It’s awful with those sausage eaters!<br>Ermólov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a German! Now p’waps<br>Wussians will get a look in. As it was, devil only knows what was<br>happening. We kept wetweating and wetweating. Did you take part in the<br>campaign?” he asked.<br><br>“I had the pleasure,” replied Prince Andrew, “not only of taking part in<br>the retreat but of losing in that retreat all I held dear—not to mention<br>the estate and home of my birth—my father, who died of grief. I belong<br>to the province of Smolénsk.”<br><br>“Ah? You’re Pwince Bolkónski? Vewy glad to make your acquaintance! I’m<br>Lieutenant Colonel Denísov, better known as ‘Váska,’” said Denísov,<br>pressing Prince Andrew’s hand and looking into his face with a<br>particularly kindly attention. “Yes, I heard,” said he sympathetically,<br>and after a short pause added: “Yes, it’s Scythian warfare. It’s all<br>vewy well—only not for those who get it in the neck. So you are Pwince<br>Andwew Bolkónski?” He swayed his head. “Vewy pleased, Pwince, to make<br>your acquaintance!” he repeated again, smiling sadly, and he again<br>pressed Prince Andrew’s hand.<br><br>Prince Andrew knew Denísov from what Natásha had told him of her first<br>suitor. This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful<br>feelings of which he had not thought lately, but which still found<br>place in his soul. Of late he had received so many new and very serious<br>impressions—such as the retreat from Smolénsk, his visit to Bald Hills,<br>and the recent news of his father’s death—and had experienced so many<br>emotions, that for a long time past those memories had not entered his<br>mind, and now that they did, they did not act on him with nearly their<br>former strength. For Denísov, too, the memories awakened by the name of<br>Bolkónski belonged to a distant, romantic past, when after supper and<br>after Natásha’s singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen<br>without realizing what he was doing. He smiled at the recollection of<br>that time and of his love for Natásha, and passed at once to what now<br>interested him passionately and exclusively. This was a plan of campaign<br>he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat. He had<br>proposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it<br>to Kutúzov. The plan was based on the fact that the French line<br>of operation was too extended, and it proposed that instead of, or<br>concurrently with, action on the front to bar the advance of the French,<br>we should attack their line of communication. He began explaining his<br>plan to Prince Andrew.<br><br>“They can’t hold all that line. It’s impossible. I will undertake to<br>bweak thwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line,<br>that’s certain! There’s only one way—guewilla warfare!”<br><br>Denísov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to<br>Bolkónski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the<br>army, growing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling with music<br>and songs and coming from the field where the review was held. Sounds of<br>hoofs and shouts were nearing the village.<br><br>“He’s coming! He’s coming!” shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.<br><br>Bolkónski and Denísov moved to the gate, at which a knot of soldiers<br>(a guard of honor) was standing, and they saw Kutúzov coming down the<br>street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of generals<br>rode behind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and a crowd of<br>officers ran after and around them shouting, “Hurrah!”<br><br>His adjutants galloped into the yard before him. Kutúzov was impatiently<br>urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he<br>raised his hand to his white Horse Guard’s cap with a red band and no<br>peak, nodding his head continually. When he came up to the guard of<br>honor, a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing decorations, who were<br>giving him the salute, he looked at them silently and attentively for<br>nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to<br>the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him. Suddenly his face<br>assumed a subtle expression, he shrugged his shoulders with an air of<br>perplexity.<br><br>“And with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by,<br>General,” he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and<br>Denísov.<br><br>“Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!” shouted those behind him.<br><br>Since Prince Andrew had last seen him Kutúzov had grown still more<br>corpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and the<br>familiar weariness of his expression were still the same. He was wearing<br>the white Horse Guard’s cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging<br>over his shoulder by a thin strap. He sat heavily and swayed limply on<br>his brisk little horse.<br><br>“Whew... whew... whew!” he whistled just audibly as he rode into the<br>yard. His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who<br>means to rest after a ceremony. He drew his left foot out of the stirrup<br>and, lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the<br>effort, raised it with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned on his knee,<br>groaned, and slipped down into the arms of the Cossacks and adjutants<br>who stood ready to assist him.<br><br>He pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes, glanced<br>at Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved with his<br>waddling gait to the porch. “Whew... whew... whew!” he whistled, and<br>again glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old men, it was<br>only after some seconds that the impression produced by Prince Andrew’s<br>face linked itself up with Kutúzov’s remembrance of his personality.<br><br>“Ah, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy? Come<br>along...” said he, glancing wearily round, and he stepped onto the porch<br>which creaked under his weight.<br><br>He unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.<br><br>“And how’s your father?”<br><br>“I received news of his death, yesterday,” replied Prince Andrew<br>abruptly.<br><br>Kutúzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off<br>his cap and crossed himself:<br><br>“May the kingdom of Heaven be his! God’s will be done to us all!” He<br>sighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. “I<br>loved him and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my heart.”<br><br>He embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for some<br>time did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw that<br>Kutúzov’s flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes. He<br>sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself.<br><br>“Come! Come with me, we’ll have a talk,” said he.<br><br>But at that moment Denísov, no more intimidated by his superiors than by<br>the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch, despite<br>the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him. Kutúzov, his<br>hands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly. Denísov, having<br>given his name, announced that he had to communicate to his Serene<br>Highness a matter of great importance for their country’s welfare.<br>Kutúzov looked wearily at him and, lifting his hands with a gesture of<br>annoyance, folded them across his stomach, repeating the words: “For our<br>country’s welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!” Denísov blushed like a<br>girl (it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous,<br>time-worn face) and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the<br>enemy’s lines of communication between Smolénsk and Vyázma. Denísov came<br>from those parts and knew the country well. His plan seemed decidedly<br>a good one, especially from the strength of conviction with which he<br>spoke. Kutúzov looked down at his own legs, occasionally glancing at the<br>door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge<br>from it. And from that hut, while Denísov was speaking, a general with a<br>portfolio under his arm really did appear.<br><br>“What?” said Kutúzov, in the midst of Denísov’s explanations, “are you<br>ready so soon?”<br><br>“Ready, your Serene Highness,” replied the general.<br><br>Kutúzov swayed his head, as much as to say: “How is one man to deal with<br>it all?” and again listened to Denísov.<br><br>“I give my word of honor as a Wussian officer,” said Denísov, “that I<br>can bweak Napoleon’s line of communication!”<br><br>“What relation are you to Intendant General Kiríl Andréevich Denísov?”<br>asked Kutúzov, interrupting him.<br><br>“He is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.”<br><br>“Ah, we were friends,” said Kutúzov cheerfully. “All right, all right,<br>friend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow we’ll have a talk.”<br><br>With a nod to Denísov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers<br>Konovnítsyn had brought him.<br><br>“Would not your Serene Highness like to come inside?” said the general<br>on duty in a discontented voice, “the plans must be examined and several<br>papers have to be signed.”<br><br>An adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness<br>within. But Kutúzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he<br>was disengaged. He made a grimace....<br><br>“No, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. I’ll look<br>at them here,” said he. “Don’t go away,” he added, turning to Prince<br>Andrew, who remained in the porch and listened to the general’s report.<br><br>While this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a woman’s<br>voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door. Several times on<br>glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome<br>woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, holding<br>a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief.<br>Kutúzov’s adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of<br>the priest whose home it was, and that she intended to offer his Serene<br>Highness bread and salt. “Her husband has welcomed his Serene Highness<br>with the cross at the church, and she intends to welcome him in the<br>house.... She’s very pretty,” added the adjutant with a smile. At<br>those words Kutúzov looked round. He was listening to the general’s<br>report—which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at<br>Tsárevo-Zaymíshche—as he had listened to Denísov, and seven years<br>previously had listened to the discussion at the Austerlitz council of<br>war. He evidently listened only because he had ears which, though there<br>was a piece of tow in one of them, could not help hearing; but it<br>was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even<br>interest him, that he knew all that would be said beforehand, and heard<br>it all only because he had to, as one has to listen to the chanting of<br>a service of prayer. All that Denísov had said was clever and to the<br>point. What the general was saying was even more clever and to<br>the point, but it was evident that Kutúzov despised knowledge<br>and cleverness, and knew of something else that would decide the<br>matter—something independent of cleverness and knowledge. Prince<br>Andrew watched the commander in chief’s face attentively, and the only<br>expression he could see there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the<br>meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to<br>observe propriety. It was evident that Kutúzov despised cleverness and<br>learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Denísov, but despised<br>them not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledge—he did not<br>try to display any of these—but because of something else. He despised<br>them because of his old age and experience of life. The only instruction<br>Kutúzov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by<br>the Russian troops. At the end of the report the general put before<br>him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army<br>commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers, when landowners<br>lodged petitions for compensation.<br><br>After hearing the matter, Kutúzov smacked his lips together and shook<br>his head.<br><br>“Into the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for all, my<br>dear fellow,” said he, “into the fire with all such things! Let them cut<br>the crops and burn wood to their hearts’ content. I don’t order it<br>or allow it, but I don’t exact compensation either. One can’t get on<br>without it. ‘When wood is chopped the chips will fly.’” He looked at the<br>paper again. “Oh, this German precision!” he muttered, shaking his head.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>“Well, that’s all!” said Kutúzov as he signed the last of the documents,<br>and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he<br>moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression.<br><br>The priest’s wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish she had after<br>all not managed to present at the right moment, though she had so long<br>been preparing for it, and with a low bow offered it to Kutúzov.<br><br>He screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and said:<br><br>“Ah, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!”<br><br>He took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the<br>dish for her. “Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?” he asked,<br>moving to the door of the room assigned to him. The priest’s wife<br>smiled, and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room.<br>The adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with<br>him. Half an hour later Prince Andrew was again called to Kutúzov.<br>He found him reclining in an armchair, still in the same unbuttoned<br>overcoat. He had in his hand a French book which he closed as Prince<br>Andrew entered, marking the place with a knife. Prince Andrew saw by the<br>cover that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.<br><br>“Well, sit down, sit down here. Let’s have a talk,” said Kutúzov. “It’s<br>sad, very sad. But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a father to you,<br>a second father....”<br><br>Prince Andrew told Kutúzov all he knew of his father’s death, and what<br>he had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.<br><br>“What... what they have brought us to!” Kutúzov suddenly cried in an<br>agitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince<br>Andrew’s story the condition Russia was in. “But give me time, give me<br>time!” he said with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue this<br>agitating conversation, and added: “I sent for you to keep you with me.”<br><br>“I thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am no longer fit for the<br>staff,” replied Prince Andrew with a smile which Kutúzov noticed.<br><br>Kutúzov glanced inquiringly at him.<br><br>“But above all,” added Prince Andrew, “I have grown used to my regiment,<br>am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I should be<br>sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being with you,<br>believe me...”<br><br>A shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up Kutúzov’s podgy<br>face. He cut Bolkónski short.<br><br>“I am sorry, for I need you. But you’re right, you’re right! It’s not<br>here that men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men are<br>not. The regiments would not be what they are if the would-be advisers<br>served there as you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I remember,<br>yes, I remember you with the standard!” said Kutúzov, and a flush of<br>pleasure suffused Prince Andrew’s face at this recollection.<br><br>Taking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kutúzov offered his cheek to<br>be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man’s eyes.<br>Though Prince Andrew knew that Kutúzov’s tears came easily, and that he<br>was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to<br>show sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both<br>pleasant and flattering to him.<br><br>“Go your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of<br>honor!” He paused. “I missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to<br>send.” And changing the subject, Kutúzov began to speak of the Turkish<br>war and the peace that had been concluded. “Yes, I have been much<br>blamed,” he said, “both for that war and the peace... but everything<br>came at the right time. Tout vient à point à celui qui sait attendre. *<br>And there were as many advisers there as here...” he went on, returning<br>to the subject of “advisers” which evidently occupied him. “Ah, those<br>advisers!” said he. “If we had listened to them all we should not have<br>made peace with Turkey and should not have been through with that war.<br>Everything in haste, but more haste, less speed. Kámenski would have<br>been lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand<br>men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to<br>win a campaign. For that, not storming and attacking but patience and<br>time are wanted. Kámenski sent soldiers to Rustchuk, but I only employed<br>these two things and took more fortresses than Kámenski and made them<br>Turks eat horseflesh!” He swayed his head. “And the French shall too,<br>believe me,” he went on, growing warmer and beating his chest, “I’ll<br>make them eat horseflesh!” And tears again dimmed his eyes.<br><br>    * “Everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.”<br><br><br>“But shan’t we have to accept battle?” remarked Prince Andrew.<br><br>“We shall if everybody wants it; it can’t be helped.... But believe<br>me, my dear boy, there is nothing stronger than those two: patience and<br>time, they will do it all. But the advisers n’entendent pas de cette<br>oreille, voilà le mal. * Some want a thing—others don’t. What’s one to<br>do?” he asked, evidently expecting an answer. “Well, what do you want<br>us to do?” he repeated and his eye shone with a deep, shrewd look.<br>“I’ll tell you what to do,” he continued, as Prince Andrew still did not<br>reply: “I will tell you what to do, and what I do. Dans le doute, mon<br>cher,” he paused, “abstiens-toi” *(2)—he articulated the French proverb<br>deliberately.<br><br>     * “Don’t see it that way, that’s the trouble.”<br><br>     * (2) “When in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing.”<br><br><br>“Well, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I share<br>your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor a prince,<br>nor a commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything come<br>straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.”<br><br>Again he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter<br>had left the room Kutúzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his<br>unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.<br><br>Prince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that<br>interview with Kutúzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to<br>the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been<br>entrusted. The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in<br>that old man—in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions,<br>and in place of an intellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions)<br>only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events—the more<br>reassured he was that everything would be as it should. “He will not<br>bring in any plan of his own. He will not devise or undertake<br>anything,” thought Prince Andrew, “but he will hear everything, remember<br>everything, and put everything in its place. He will not hinder<br>anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He understands that there is<br>something stronger and more important than his own will—the inevitable<br>course of events, and he can see them and grasp their significance,<br>and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his<br>personal wish directed to something else. And above all,” thought Prince<br>Andrew, “one believes in him because he’s Russian, despite the novel<br>by Genlis and the French proverbs, and because his voice shook when he<br>said: ‘What they have brought us to!’ and had a sob in it when he said<br>he would ‘make them eat horseflesh!’”<br><br>On such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity and<br>general approval were founded with which, despite court influences, the<br>popular choice of Kutúzov as commander in chief was received.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVII<br><br>After the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual<br>course, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to<br>remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to believe<br>that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English<br>Club were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything<br>for it. The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had<br>displayed during the Emperor’s stay was the call for contributions of<br>men and money, a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made<br>assumed a legal, official form and became unavoidable.<br><br>With the enemy’s approach to Moscow, the Moscovites’ view of their<br>situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even<br>more frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger<br>approaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices that<br>speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably tells a<br>man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it;<br>the other, still more reasonably, says that it is too depressing and<br>painful to think of the danger, since it is not in man’s power to<br>foresee everything and avert the general course of events, and it is<br>therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes, and to<br>think about what is pleasant. In solitude a man generally listens to<br>the first voice, but in society to the second. So it was now with the<br>inhabitants of Moscow. It was long since people had been as gay in<br>Moscow as that year.<br><br>Rostopchín’s broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a potman,<br>and a Moscow burgher called Karpúshka Chigírin, “who—having been a<br>militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub—heard that Napoleon<br>wished to come to Moscow, grew angry, abused the French in very bad<br>language, came out of the drink shop, and, under the sign of the<br>eagle, began to address the assembled people,” were read and discussed,<br>together with the latest of Vasíli Lvóvich Púshkin’s bouts rimés.<br><br>In the corner room at the Club, members gathered to read these<br>broadsheets, and some liked the way Karpúshka jeered at the French,<br>saying: “They will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our<br>buckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup. They are all<br>dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork.”<br>Others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar. It was<br>said that Rostopchín had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners<br>from Moscow, and that there had been some spies and agents of Napoleon<br>among them; but this was told chiefly to introduce Rostopchín’s witty<br>remark on that occasion. The foreigners were deported to Nízhni by<br>boat, and Rostopchín had said to them in French: “Rentrez en vous-mêmes;<br>entrez dans la barque, et n’en faites pas une barque de Charon.” * There<br>was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from<br>Moscow, and to this Shinshín’s witticism was added—that for that alone<br>Moscow ought to be grateful to Napoleon. It was said that Mamónov’s<br>regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles, and that Bezúkhov<br>had spent even more on his, but that the best thing about Bezúkhov’s<br>action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the<br>head of his regiment without charging anything for the show.<br><br>     * “Think it over; get into the barque, and take care not to<br>     make it a barque of Charon.”<br><br><br>“You don’t spare anyone,” said Julie Drubetskáya as she collected<br>and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin, beringed<br>fingers.<br><br>Julie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a farewell<br>soiree.<br><br>“Bezúkhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and good-natured. What<br>pleasure is there to be so caustique?”<br><br>“A forfeit!” cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie called “mon<br>chevalier,” and who was going with her to Nízhni.<br><br>In Julie’s set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been agreed<br>that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a<br>slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary<br>Contributions.<br><br>“Another forfeit for a Gallicism,” said a Russian writer who was<br>present. “‘What pleasure is there to be’ is not Russian!”<br><br>“You spare no one,” continued Julie to the young man without heeding the<br>author’s remark.<br><br>“For caustique—I am guilty and will pay, and I am prepared to pay again<br>for the pleasure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I won’t be<br>responsible,” she remarked, turning to the author: “I have neither the<br>money nor the time, like Prince Galítsyn, to engage a master to teach me<br>Russian!”<br><br>“Ah, here he is!” she added. “Quand on... No, no,” she said to the<br>militia officer, “you won’t catch me. Speak of the sun and you see its<br>rays!” and she smiled amiably at Pierre. “We were just talking of you,”<br>she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman. “We were<br>saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than Mamónov’s.”<br><br>“Oh, don’t talk to me of my regiment,” replied Pierre, kissing his<br>hostess’ hand and taking a seat beside her. “I am so sick of it.”<br><br>“You will, of course, command it yourself?” said Julie, directing a sly,<br>sarcastic glance toward the militia officer.<br><br>The latter in Pierre’s presence had ceased to be caustic, and his face<br>expressed perplexity as to what Julie’s smile might mean. In spite of<br>his absent-mindedness and good nature, Pierre’s personality immediately<br>checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face.<br><br>“No,” said Pierre, with a laughing glance at his big, stout body. “I<br>should make too good a target for the French, besides I am afraid I<br>should hardly be able to climb onto a horse.”<br><br>Among those whom Julie’s guests happened to choose to gossip about were<br>the Rostóvs.<br><br>“I hear that their affairs are in a very bad way,” said Julie. “And he<br>is so unreasonable, the count himself I mean. The Razumóvskis wanted<br>to buy his house and his estate near Moscow, but it drags on and on. He<br>asks too much.”<br><br>“No, I think the sale will come off in a few days,” said someone.<br>“Though it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now.”<br><br>“Why?” asked Julie. “You don’t think Moscow is in danger?”<br><br>“Then why are you leaving?”<br><br>“I? What a question! I am going because... well, because everyone is<br>going: and besides—I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon.”<br><br>“Well, of course, of course! Let me have some more strips of linen.”<br><br>“If he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his<br>debts,” said the militia officer, speaking of Rostóv.<br><br>“A kindly old man but not up to much. And why do they stay on so long in<br>Moscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago. Natalie is quite<br>well again now, isn’t she?” Julie asked Pierre with a knowing smile.<br><br>“They are waiting for their younger son,” Pierre replied. “He joined<br>Obolénski’s Cossacks and went to Bélaya Tsérkov where the regiment is<br>being formed. But now they have had him transferred to my regiment and<br>are expecting him every day. The count wanted to leave long ago, but the<br>countess won’t on any account leave Moscow till her son returns.”<br><br>“I met them the day before yesterday at the Arkhárovs’. Natalie has<br>recovered her looks and is brighter. She sang a song. How easily some<br>people get over everything!”<br><br>“Get over what?” inquired Pierre, looking displeased.<br><br>Julie smiled.<br><br>“You know, Count, such knights as you are only found in Madame de<br>Souza’s novels.”<br><br>“What knights? What do you mean?” demanded Pierre, blushing.<br><br>“Oh, come, my dear count! C’est la fable de tout Moscou. Je vous admire,<br>ma parole d’honneur!” *<br><br>    * “It is the talk of all Moscow. My word, I admire you!”<br><br><br>“Forfeit, forfeit!” cried the militia officer.<br><br>“All right, one can’t talk—how tiresome!”<br><br>“What is ‘the talk of all Moscow’?” Pierre asked angrily, rising to his<br>feet.<br><br>“Come now, Count, you know!”<br><br>“I don’t know anything about it,” said Pierre.<br><br>“I know you were friendly with Natalie, and so... but I was always more<br>friendly with Véra—that dear Véra.”<br><br>“No, madame!” Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, “I have not<br>taken on myself the role of Natalie Rostóva’s knight at all, and have<br>not been to their house for nearly a month. But I cannot understand the<br>cruelty...”<br><br>“Qui s’excuse s’accuse,” * said Julie, smiling and waving the lint<br>triumphantly, and to have the last word she promptly changed the<br>subject. “Do you know what I heard today? Poor Mary Bolkónskaya arrived<br>in Moscow yesterday. Do you know that she has lost her father?”<br><br>    * “Who excuses himself, accuses himself.”<br><br><br>“Really? Where is she? I should like very much to see her,” said Pierre.<br><br>“I spent the evening with her yesterday. She is going to their estate<br>near Moscow either today or tomorrow morning, with her nephew.”<br><br>“Well, and how is she?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“She is well, but sad. But do you know who rescued her? It is quite a<br>romance. Nicholas Rostóv! She was surrounded, and they wanted to kill<br>her and had wounded some of her people. He rushed in and saved her....”<br><br>“Another romance,” said the militia officer. “Really, this general<br>flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off. Catiche<br>is one and Princess Bolkónskaya another.”<br><br>“Do you know, I really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune<br>homme.” *<br><br>    * “A little bit in love with the young man.”<br><br><br>“Forfeit, forfeit, forfeit!”<br><br>“But how could one say that in Russian?”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>When Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopchín’s broadsheets<br>that had been brought that day.<br><br>The first declared that the report that Count Rostopchín had forbidden<br>people to leave Moscow was false; on the contrary he was glad that<br>ladies and tradesmen’s wives were leaving the city. “There will be less<br>panic and less gossip,” ran the broadsheet “but I will stake my life on<br>it that that scoundrel will not enter Moscow.” These words showed Pierre<br>clearly for the first time that the French would enter Moscow. The<br>second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at Vyázma, that<br>Count Wittgenstein had defeated the French, but that as many of the<br>inhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed, weapons were ready for them<br>at the arsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which could be had at a low<br>price. The tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former<br>Chigírin talks. Pierre pondered over these broadsheets. Evidently the<br>terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul<br>but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near.<br><br>“Shall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?” he asked himself<br>for the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards that lay on the table<br>and began to lay them out for a game of patience.<br><br>“If this patience comes out,” he said to himself after shuffling the<br>cards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, “if it comes out,<br>it means... what does it mean?”<br><br>He had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the<br>eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.<br><br>“Then it will mean that I must go to the army,” said Pierre to himself.<br>“Come in, come in!” he added to the princess.<br><br>Only the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long waist,<br>was still living in Pierre’s house. The two younger ones had both<br>married.<br><br>“Excuse my coming to you, cousin,” she said in a reproachful and<br>agitated voice. “You know some decision must be come to. What is going<br>to happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is<br>it that we are staying on?”<br><br>“On the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine,” said Pierre<br>in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling<br>uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.<br><br>“Satisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Ivánovna told me today<br>how our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly does them<br>credit! And the people too are quite mutinous—they no longer obey,<br>even my maid has taken to being rude. At this rate they will soon begin<br>beating us. One can’t walk in the streets. But, above all, the French<br>will be here any day now, so what are we waiting for? I ask just one<br>thing of you, cousin,” she went on, “arrange for me to be taken to<br>Petersburg. Whatever I may be, I can’t live under Bonaparte’s rule.”<br><br>“Oh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On the<br>contrary...”<br><br>“I won’t submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If you<br>don’t want to do this...”<br><br>“But I will, I’ll give the order at once.”<br><br>The princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with.<br>Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.<br><br>“But you have been misinformed,” said Pierre. “Everything is quiet in<br>the city and there is not the slightest danger. See! I’ve just been<br>reading...” He showed her the broadsheet. “Count Rostopchín writes that<br>he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter Moscow.”<br><br>“Oh, that count of yours!” said the princess malevolently. “He is a<br>hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot. Didn’t<br>he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, ‘whoever it might be,<br>should be dragged to the lockup by his hair’? (How silly!) ‘And honor<br>and glory to whoever captures him,’ he says. This is what his cajolery<br>has brought us to! Barbara Ivánovna told me the mob near killed her<br>because she said something in French.”<br><br>“Oh, but it’s so... You take everything so to heart,” said Pierre, and<br>began laying out his cards for patience.<br><br>Although that patience did come out, Pierre did not join the army,<br>but remained in deserted Moscow ever in the same state of agitation,<br>irresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time joyfully expecting<br>something terrible.<br><br>Next day toward evening the princess set off, and Pierre’s head steward<br>came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his<br>regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates. In<br>general the head steward made out to Pierre that his project of raising<br>a regiment would ruin him. Pierre listened to him, scarcely able to<br>repress a smile.<br><br>“Well then, sell it,” said he. “What’s to be done? I can’t draw back<br>now!”<br><br>The worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the better<br>was Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he<br>expected was approaching. Hardly anyone he knew was left in town. Julie<br>had gone, and so had Princess Mary. Of his intimate friends only the<br>Rostóvs remained, but he did not go to see them.<br><br>To distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of Vorontsóvo<br>to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to destroy the foe,<br>and a trial balloon that was to go up next day. The balloon was not yet<br>ready, but Pierre learned that it was being constructed by the Emperor’s<br>desire. The Emperor had written to Count Rostopchín as follows:<br><br>As soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and<br>intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General Kutúzov to let<br>him know. I have informed him of the matter.<br><br>Please impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for<br>the first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy’s<br>hands. It is essential for him to combine his movements with those of<br>the commander in chief.<br><br><br>On his way home from Vorontsóvo, as he was passing the Bolótnoe Place<br>Pierre, seeing a large crowd round the Lóbnoe Place, stopped and got out<br>of his trap. A French cook accused of being a spy was being flogged. The<br>flogging was only just over, and the executioner was releasing from the<br>flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in blue stockings and<br>a green jacket, who was moaning piteously. Another criminal, thin and<br>pale, stood near. Judging by their faces they were both Frenchmen. With<br>a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin Frenchman’s<br>face, Pierre pushed his way in through the crowd.<br><br>“What is it? Who is it? What is it for?” he kept asking.<br><br>But the attention of the crowd—officials, burghers, shopkeepers,<br>peasants, and women in cloaks and in pelisses—was so eagerly centered on<br>what was passing in Lóbnoe Place that no one answered him. The stout man<br>rose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently trying to appear<br>firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him, but suddenly<br>his lips trembled and he began to cry, in the way full-blooded grown-up<br>men cry, though angry with himself for doing so. In the crowd people<br>began talking loudly, to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to<br>Pierre.<br><br>“He’s cook to some prince.”<br><br>“Eh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets his<br>teeth on edge!” said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind Pierre,<br>when the Frenchman began to cry.<br><br>The clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be<br>appreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch in<br>dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.<br><br>Pierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went back<br>to his trap muttering something to himself as he went, and took his<br>seat. As they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so<br>audibly that the coachman asked him:<br><br>“What is your pleasure?”<br><br>“Where are you going?” shouted Pierre to the man, who was driving to<br>Lubyánka Street.<br><br>“To the Governor’s, as you ordered,” answered the coachman.<br><br>“Fool! Idiot!” shouted Pierre, abusing his coachman—a thing he rarely<br>did. “Home, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!” “I must get away<br>this very day,” he murmured to himself.<br><br>At the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the<br>Lóbnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no<br>longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that very day that<br>it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the<br>man ought to have known it for himself.<br><br>On reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evstáfey—his head coachman who<br>knew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow—that<br>he would leave that night for the army at Mozháysk, and that his saddle<br>horses should be sent there. This could not all be arranged that day,<br>so on Evstáfey’s representation Pierre had to put off his departure till<br>next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance.<br><br>On the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain, and<br>after dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses that night<br>in Perkhúshkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that<br>evening. (This was the battle of Shevárdino.) He was told that there in<br>Perkhúshkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could answer<br>his questions as to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was approaching<br>Mozháysk.<br><br>Every house in Mozháysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the hostel<br>where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be<br>had. It was full of officers.<br><br>Everywhere in Mozháysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on the<br>march. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and cannon<br>were everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and the<br>farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea<br>of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and<br>joyful feeling he had not experienced before. It was a feeling akin<br>to what he had felt at the Slobóda Palace during the Emperor’s visit—a<br>sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing<br>something. He now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that<br>constitutes men’s happiness—the comforts of life, wealth, even<br>life itself—is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away, compared with<br>something... With what? Pierre could not say, and he did not try to<br>determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in<br>sacrificing everything. He was not occupied with the question of what to<br>sacrifice for; the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and<br>joyous sensation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIX<br><br>On the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the Shevárdino Redoubt was<br>fought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side, and on<br>the twenty-sixth the battle of Borodinó itself took place.<br><br>Why and how were the battles of Shevárdino and Borodinó given and<br>accepted? Why was the battle of Borodinó fought? There was not the least<br>sense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate result<br>for the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought nearer<br>to the destruction of Moscow—which we feared more than anything in<br>the world; and for the French its immediate result was that they were<br>brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army—which they feared<br>more than anything in the world. What the result must be was quite<br>obvious, and yet Napoleon offered and Kutúzov accepted that battle.<br><br>If the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it must<br>have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles<br>and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army,<br>he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally<br>clear to Kutúzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a<br>quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow. For Kutúzov this was<br>mathematically clear, as it is that if when playing draughts I have one<br>man less and go on exchanging, I shall certainly lose, and therefore<br>should not exchange. When my opponent has sixteen men and I have<br>fourteen, I am only one eighth weaker than he, but when I have exchanged<br>thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as I am.<br><br>Before the battle of Borodinó our strength in proportion to the French<br>was about as five to six, but after that battle it was little more than<br>one to two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and<br>twenty thousand; afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a<br>hundred thousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced Kutúzov accepted the<br>battle, while Napoleon, who was said to be a commander of genius,<br>gave it, losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of<br>communication still more. If it is said that he expected to end the<br>campaign by occupying Moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by<br>occupying Vienna, there is much evidence to the contrary. Napoleon’s<br>historians themselves tell us that from Smolénsk onwards he wished<br>to stop, knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the<br>occupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, for he had<br>seen at Smolénsk the state in which Russian towns were left to him, and<br>had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his<br>wish to negotiate.<br><br>In giving and accepting battle at Borodinó, Kutúzov acted involuntarily<br>and irrationally. But later on, to fit what had occurred, the historians<br>provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the<br>generals who, of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved<br>and involuntary.<br><br>The ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish<br>the whole interest of the story, and we are still unable to accustom<br>ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are<br>meaningless.<br><br>On the other question, how the battle of Borodinó and the preceding<br>battle of Shevárdino were fought, there also exists a definite and<br>well-known, but quite false, conception. All the historians describe the<br>affair as follows:<br><br>The Russian army, they say, in its retreat from Smolénsk sought out<br>for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a<br>position at Borodinó.<br><br>The Russians, they say, fortified this position in advance on the left<br>of the highroad (from Moscow to Smolénsk) and almost at a right angle<br>to it, from Borodinó to Utítsa, at the very place where the battle was<br>fought.<br><br>In front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was set up on<br>the Shevárdino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth, we<br>are told, Napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on the<br>twenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which was in position on<br>the field of Borodinó.<br><br>So the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares to<br>look into the matter can easily convince himself.<br><br>The Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the contrary,<br>during the retreat passed many positions better than Borodinó. They did<br>not stop at any one of these positions because Kutúzov did not wish to<br>occupy a position he had not himself chosen, because the popular demand<br>for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough, and because<br>Milorádovich had not yet arrived with the militia, and for many other<br>reasons. The fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger,<br>and that the position at Borodinó (the one where the battle was fought),<br>far from being strong, was no more a position than any other spot one<br>might find in the Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at<br>hazard.<br><br>Not only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of<br>Borodinó to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that<br>is, the position on which the battle took place), but never till the<br>twenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be<br>fought there. This was shown first by the fact that there were no<br>entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the<br>twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the<br>position of the Shevárdino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless<br>in front of the position where the battle was accepted. Why was it<br>more strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all efforts<br>exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at<br>night on the twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have sufficed to<br>observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position on which the<br>battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the Shevárdino Redoubt<br>was not an advanced post of that position, we have the fact that up to<br>the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and Bagratión were convinced that the<br>Shevárdino Redoubt was the left flank of the position, and that Kutúzov<br>himself in his report, written in hot haste after the battle, speaks of<br>the Shevárdino Redoubt as the left flank of the position. It was much<br>later, when reports on the battle of Borodinó were written at leisure,<br>that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented (probably to<br>justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented<br>as infallible) that the Shevárdino Redoubt was an advanced post—whereas<br>in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank—and that<br>the battle of Borodinó was fought by us on an entrenched position<br>previously selected, whereas it was fought on a quite unexpected spot<br>which was almost unentrenched.<br><br>The case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river<br>Kolochá—which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute<br>angle—so that the left flank was at Shevárdino, the right flank near the<br>village of Nóvoe, and the center at Borodinó at the confluence of the<br>rivers Kolochá and Vóyna.<br><br>To anyone who looks at the field of Borodinó without thinking of how<br>the battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the river<br>Kolochá, presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to<br>prevent an enemy from advancing along the Smolénsk road to Moscow.<br><br>Napoleon, riding to Valúevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as the<br>history books say he did) the position of the Russians from Utítsa<br>to Borodinó (he could not have seen that position because it did not<br>exist), nor did he see an advanced post of the Russian army, but while<br>pursuing the Russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the<br>Russian position—at the Shevárdino Redoubt—and unexpectedly for the<br>Russians moved his army across the Kolochá. And the Russians, not having<br>time to begin a general engagement, withdrew their left wing from the<br>position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which<br>had not been foreseen and was not fortified. By crossing to the other<br>side of the Kolochá to the left of the highroad, Napoleon shifted the<br>whole forthcoming battle from right to left (looking from the Russian<br>side) and transferred it to the plain between Utítsa, Semënovsk, and<br>Borodinó—a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain<br>in Russia—and there the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of August took<br>place.<br><br>Had Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the<br>Kolochá, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt<br>but had begun the attack next morning, no one would have doubted that<br>the Shevárdino Redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the<br>battle would have taken place where we expected it. In that case<br>we should probably have defended the Shevárdino Redoubt—our left<br>flank—still more obstinately. We should have attacked Napoleon in the<br>center or on the right, and the engagement would have taken place on the<br>twenty-fifth, in the position we intended and had fortified. But as the<br>attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of<br>our rear guard (that is, immediately after the fight at Gridnëva), and<br>as the Russian commanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a<br>general engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first<br>and chief action of the battle of Borodinó was already lost on the<br>twenty-fourth, and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the<br>twenty-sixth.<br><br>After the loss of the Shevárdino Redoubt, we found ourselves on the<br>morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank, and<br>were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to<br>be.<br><br>Not only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak,<br>unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was<br>increased by the fact that the Russian commanders—not having fully<br>realized what had happened, namely the loss of our position on the left<br>flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from<br>right to left—maintained their extended position from the village of<br>Nóvoe to Utítsa, and consequently had to move their forces from right to<br>left during the battle. So it happened that throughout the whole battle<br>the Russians opposed the entire French army launched against our left<br>flank with but half as many men. (Poniatowski’s action against Utítsa,<br>and Uvárov’s on the right flank against the French, were actions<br>distinct from the main course of the battle.) So the battle of Borodinó<br>did not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders’<br>mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian<br>army and people) it has been described. The battle of Borodinó was not<br>fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly<br>weaker than those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the<br>Shevárdino Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of Borodinó on an<br>open and almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous<br>as the French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not<br>merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive<br>result, but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete<br>disintegration and flight.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XX<br><br>On the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving Mozháysk. At the<br>descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led out of the<br>town past the cathedral on the right, where a service was being held and<br>the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on<br>foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by<br>its singers. Coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who<br>had been wounded in the engagement the day before. The peasant drivers,<br>shouting and lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side. The<br>carts, in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying<br>or sitting, jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep<br>incline to make it something like a road. The wounded, bandaged with<br>rags, with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to<br>the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another. Almost<br>all of them stared with naïve, childlike curiosity at Pierre’s white hat<br>and green swallow-tail coat.<br><br>Pierre’s coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to<br>one side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the hill<br>with its singers, surrounded Pierre’s carriage and blocked the road.<br>Pierre stopped, being pressed against the side of the cutting in which<br>the road ran. The sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into<br>the cutting and there it was cold and damp, but above Pierre’s head was<br>the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded merrily. One of the<br>carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to Pierre. The<br>driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it, placed a stone under one<br>of its tireless hind wheels, and began arranging the breech-band on his<br>little horse.<br><br>One of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following<br>the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to<br>look at Pierre.<br><br>“I say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us on to<br>Moscow?” he asked.<br><br>Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question. He was<br>looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded,<br>now at the cart by which he was standing, in which two wounded men<br>were sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in the cart had<br>probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was wrapped in rags<br>and one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby’s head. His nose<br>and mouth were twisted to one side. This soldier was looking at the<br>cathedral and crossing himself. Another, a young lad, a fair-haired<br>recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face, looked<br>at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile. The third lay prone so that his<br>face was not visible. The cavalry singers were passing close by:<br><br>   Ah lost, quite lost... is my head so keen,<br>   Living in a foreign land...<br><br>they sang their soldiers’ dance song.<br><br>As if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the<br>metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of<br>the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of<br>merriment. But beneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded near the<br>panting little nag where Pierre stood, it was damp, somber, and sad.<br><br>The soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry<br>singers.<br><br>“Oh, the coxcombs!” he muttered reproachfully.<br><br>“It’s not the soldiers only, but I’ve seen peasants today, too....<br>The peasants—even they have to go,” said the soldier behind the cart,<br>addressing Pierre with a sad smile. “No distinctions made nowadays....<br>They want the whole nation to fall on them—in a word, it’s Moscow! They<br>want to make an end of it.”<br><br>In spite of the obscurity of the soldier’s words Pierre understood what<br>he wanted to say and nodded approval.<br><br>The road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on.<br><br>He kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, but only<br>saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different<br>branches of the service, who all looked with astonishment at his white<br>hat and green tail coat.<br><br>Having gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and<br>eagerly addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. He was<br>driving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young surgeon,<br>and on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied the driver’s<br>seat to pull up.<br><br>“Count! Your excellency, how come you to be here?” asked the doctor.<br><br>“Well, you know, I wanted to see...”<br><br>“Yes, yes, there will be something to see....”<br><br>Pierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention of<br>taking part in a battle.<br><br>The doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutúzov.<br><br>“Why should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?” he<br>said, exchanging glances with his young companion. “Anyhow his Serene<br>Highness knows you and will receive you graciously. That’s what you must<br>do.”<br><br>The doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.<br><br>“You think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is<br>exactly?” said Pierre.<br><br>“The position?” repeated the doctor. “Well, that’s not my line. Drive<br>past Tatárinova, a lot of digging is going on there. Go up the hillock<br>and you’ll see.”<br><br>“Can one see from there?... If you would...”<br><br>But the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.<br><br>“I would go with you but on my honor I’m up to here”—and he pointed to<br>his throat. “I’m galloping to the commander of the corps. How do matters<br>stand?... You know, Count, there’ll be a battle tomorrow. Out of an army<br>of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded,<br>and we haven’t stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or doctors enough for<br>six thousand. We have ten thousand carts, but we need other things as<br>well—we must manage as best we can!”<br><br>The strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and old, who<br>had stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had<br>noticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death<br>amazed Pierre.<br><br>“They may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but death?”<br>And by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the Mozháysk hill,<br>the carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the slanting rays of the<br>sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind.<br><br>“The cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment<br>think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded. Yet from<br>among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they wonder at my<br>hat! Strange!” thought Pierre, continuing his way to Tatárinova.<br><br>In front of a landowner’s house to the left of the road stood carriages,<br>wagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels. The commander in chief<br>was putting up there, but just when Pierre arrived he was not in and<br>hardly any of the staff were there—they had gone to the church service.<br>Pierre drove on toward Górki.<br><br>When he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street, he<br>saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with<br>crosses on their caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated and<br>perspiring, were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the<br>right of the road.<br><br>Some of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth<br>along planks, while others stood about doing nothing.<br><br>Two officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. On seeing<br>these peasants, who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their<br>position as soldiers, Pierre once more thought of the wounded men at<br>Mozháysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said: “They<br>want the whole nation to fall on them.” The sight of these bearded<br>peasants at work on the battlefield, with their queer, clumsy boots<br>and perspiring necks, and their shirts opening from the left toward<br>the middle, unfastened, exposing their sunburned collarbones, impressed<br>Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment<br>than anything he had yet seen or heard.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXI<br><br>Pierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling militiamen,<br>ascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor, the battlefield<br>could be seen.<br><br>It was about eleven o’clock. The sun shone somewhat to the left and<br>behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which, rising like<br>an amphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere.<br><br>From above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the Smolénsk<br>highroad, passing through a village with a white church some five<br>hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it. This was Borodinó.<br>Below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and, winding<br>down and up, rose higher and higher to the village of Valúevo visible<br>about four miles away, where Napoleon was then stationed. Beyond Valúevo<br>the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon. Far in<br>the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the<br>cross and belfry of the Kolochá Monastery gleamed in the sun. Here and<br>there over the whole of that blue expanse, to right and left of the<br>forest and the road, smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite<br>masses of troops—ours and the enemy’s. The ground to the right—along the<br>course of the Kolochá and Moskvá rivers—was broken and hilly. Between<br>the hollows the villages of Bezúbova and Zakhárino showed in the<br>distance. On the left the ground was more level; there were fields of<br>grain, and the smoking ruins of Semënovsk, which had been burned down,<br>could be seen.<br><br>All that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the<br>right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations. Nowhere<br>could he see the battlefield he had expected to find, but only fields,<br>meadows, troops, woods, the smoke of campfires, villages, mounds, and<br>streams; and try as he would he could descry no military “position” in<br>this place which teemed with life, nor could he even distinguish our<br>troops from the enemy’s.<br><br>“I must ask someone who knows,” he thought, and addressed an officer who<br>was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure.<br><br>“May I ask you,” said Pierre, “what village that is in front?”<br><br>“Búrdino, isn’t it?” said the officer, turning to his companion.<br><br>“Borodinó,” the other corrected him.<br><br>The officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, moved up to<br>Pierre.<br><br>“Are those our men there?” Pierre inquired.<br><br>“Yes, and there, further on, are the French,” said the officer. “There<br>they are, there... you can see them.”<br><br>“Where? Where?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“One can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!”<br><br>The officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left<br>beyond the river, and the same stern and serious expression that Pierre<br>had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face.<br><br>“Ah, those are the French! And over there?...” Pierre pointed to a knoll<br>on the left, near which some troops could be seen.<br><br>“Those are ours.”<br><br>“Ah, ours! And there?...” Pierre pointed to another knoll in the<br>distance with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow<br>where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible.<br><br>“That’s his again,” said the officer. (It was the Shevárdino Redoubt.)<br>“It was ours yesterday, but now it is his.”<br><br>“Then how about our position?”<br><br>“Our position?” replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction. “I<br>can tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our<br>entrenchments. There, you see? There’s our center, at Borodinó, just<br>there,” and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white<br>church. “That’s where one crosses the Kolochá. You see down there where<br>the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, there’s the bridge. That’s our<br>center. Our right flank is over there”—he pointed sharply to the right,<br>far away in the broken ground—“That’s where the Moskvá River is, and<br>we have thrown up three redoubts there, very strong ones. The left<br>flank...” here the officer paused. “Well, you see, that’s difficult to<br>explain.... Yesterday our left flank was there at Shevárdino, you see,<br>where the oak is, but now we have withdrawn our left wing—now it is over<br>there, do you see that village and the smoke? That’s Semënovsk, yes,<br>there,” he pointed to Raévski’s knoll. “But the battle will hardly<br>be there. His having moved his troops there is only a ruse; he will<br>probably pass round to the right of the Moskvá. But wherever it may be,<br>many a man will be missing tomorrow!” he remarked.<br><br>An elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving<br>these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking, but<br>at this point, evidently not liking the officer’s remark, interrupted<br>him.<br><br>“Gabions must be sent for,” said he sternly.<br><br>The officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might<br>think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak<br>of it.<br><br>“Well, send number three company again,” the officer replied hurriedly.<br><br>“And you, are you one of the doctors?”<br><br>“No, I’ve come on my own,” answered Pierre, and he went down the hill<br>again, passing the militiamen.<br><br>“Oh, those damned fellows!” muttered the officer who followed him,<br>holding his nose as he ran past the men at work.<br><br>“There they are... bringing her, coming... There they are... They’ll be<br>here in a minute...” voices were suddenly heard saying; and officers,<br>soldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the road.<br><br>A church procession was coming up the hill from Borodinó. First along<br>the dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with arms<br>reversed. From behind them came the sound of church singing.<br><br>Soldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the<br>procession.<br><br>“They are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian Mother of God!”<br>someone cried.<br><br>“The Smolénsk Mother of God,” another corrected him.<br><br>The militiamen, both those who had been in the village and those who had<br>been at work on the battery, threw down their spades and ran to meet the<br>church procession. Following the battalion that marched along the dusty<br>road came priests in their vestments—one little old man in a hood with<br>attendants and singers. Behind them soldiers and officers bore a large,<br>dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover. This was the icon that had<br>been brought from Smolénsk and had since accompanied the army. Behind,<br>before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked,<br>ran, and bowed to the ground.<br><br>At the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had<br>been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by<br>others, the chanters relit their censers, and service began. The hot<br>rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with<br>the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon.<br>The singing did not sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd<br>of bareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon.<br>Behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot<br>reserved for them. A bald general with a St. George’s Cross on his neck<br>stood just behind the priest’s back, and without crossing himself (he<br>was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service, which<br>he considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to arouse the<br>patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a martial<br>pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest<br>while looking about him. Standing among the crowd of peasants, Pierre<br>recognized several acquaintances among these notables, but did not<br>look at them—his whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious<br>expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were<br>all gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the tired chanters, who were<br>singing the service for the twentieth time that day, began lazily and<br>mechanically to sing: “Save from calamity Thy servants, O Mother of<br>God,” and the priest and deacon chimed in: “For to Thee under God we all<br>flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection,” there again kindled in<br>all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity<br>of the impending moment that Pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of<br>the hill at Mozháysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met<br>that morning; and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back,<br>and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.<br><br>The crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against Pierre.<br>Someone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which way<br>was made for him, was approaching the icon.<br><br>It was Kutúzov, who had been riding round the position and on his way<br>back to Tatárinova had stopped where the service was being held. Pierre<br>recognized him at once by his peculiar figure, which distinguished him<br>from everybody else.<br><br>With a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered body,<br>with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the<br>eye he had lost, Kutúzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into<br>the crowd and stopped behind the priest. He crossed himself with an<br>accustomed movement, bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and<br>bowed his white head with a deep sigh. Behind Kutúzov was Bennigsen and<br>the suite. Despite the presence of the commander in chief, who attracted<br>the attention of all the superior officers, the militiamen and soldiers<br>continued their prayers without looking at him.<br><br>When the service was over, Kutúzov stepped up to the icon, sank heavily<br>to his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long time tried vainly to<br>rise, but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight. His<br>white head twitched with the effort. At last he rose, kissed the icon as<br>a child does with naïvely pouting lips, and again bowed till he touched<br>the ground with his hand. The other generals followed his example,<br>then the officers, and after them with excited faces, pressing on one<br>another, crowding, panting, and pushing, scrambled the soldiers and<br>militiamen.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXII<br><br>Staggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.<br><br>“Count Peter Kirílovich! How did you get here?” said a voice.<br><br>Pierre looked round. Borís Drubetskóy, brushing his knees with his hand<br>(he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the icon),<br>came up to him smiling. Borís was elegantly dressed, with a slightly<br>martial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long coat and like<br>Kutúzov had a whip slung across his shoulder.<br><br>Meanwhile Kutúzov had reached the village and seated himself in the<br>shade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run<br>to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and<br>brilliant suite surrounded him.<br><br>The icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre stopped<br>some thirty paces from Kutúzov, talking to Borís.<br><br>He explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the<br>position.<br><br>“This is what you must do,” said Borís. “I will do the honors of the<br>camp to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen<br>will be. I am in attendance on him, you know; I’ll mention it to him.<br>But if you want to ride round the position, come along with us. We are<br>just going to the left flank. Then when we get back, do spend the night<br>with me and we’ll arrange a game of cards. Of course you know Dmítri<br>Sergéevich? Those are his quarters,” and he pointed to the third house<br>in the village of Górki.<br><br>“But I should like to see the right flank. They say it’s very strong,”<br>said Pierre. “I should like to start from the Moskvá River and ride<br>round the whole position.”<br><br>“Well, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left flank.”<br><br>“Yes, yes. But where is Prince Bolkónski’s regiment? Can you point it<br>out to me?”<br><br>“Prince Andrew’s? We shall pass it and I’ll take you to him.”<br><br>“What about the left flank?” asked Pierre<br><br>“To tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state our<br>left flank is in,” said Borís confidentially lowering his voice. “It is<br>not at all what Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify that knoll<br>quite differently, but...” Borís shrugged his shoulders, “his Serene<br>Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded him. You see...” but<br>Borís did not finish, for at that moment Kaysárov, Kutúzov’s adjutant,<br>came up to Pierre. “Ah, Kaysárov!” said Borís, addressing him with an<br>unembarrassed smile, “I was just trying to explain our position to<br>the count. It is amazing how his Serene Highness could so foresee the<br>intentions of the French!”<br><br>“You mean the left flank?” asked Kaysárov.<br><br>“Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.”<br><br>Though Kutúzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff, Borís<br>had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He had<br>established himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom Borís<br>had been in attendance, considered young Prince Drubetskóy an invaluable<br>man.<br><br>In the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: Kutúzov’s<br>party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Borís belonged to the<br>latter and no one else, while showing servile respect to Kutúzov, could<br>so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that<br>Bennigsen managed everything. Now the decisive moment of battle had come<br>when Kutúzov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even<br>if Kutúzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by<br>Bennigsen. In any case many great rewards would have to be given for<br>tomorrow’s action, and new men would come to the front. So Borís was<br>full of nervous vivacity all day.<br><br>After Kaysárov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had not<br>time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered upon<br>him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all expressed<br>animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of<br>the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions<br>of personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by the different<br>expression he saw on other faces—an expression that spoke not of<br>personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death.<br>Kutúzov noticed Pierre’s figure and the group gathered round him.<br><br>“Call him to me,” said Kutúzov.<br><br>An adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness’ wish, and Pierre went<br>toward Kutúzov’s bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It was<br>Dólokhov.<br><br>“How did that fellow get here?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“He’s a creature that wriggles in anywhere!” was the answer. “He<br>has been degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. He’s been<br>proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy’s picket<br>line at night.... He’s a brave fellow.”<br><br>Pierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutúzov.<br><br>“I concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might send<br>me away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I shouldn’t<br>lose anything...” Dólokhov was saying.<br><br>“Yes, yes.”<br><br>“But if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my Fatherland<br>for which I am ready to die.”<br><br>“Yes, yes.”<br><br>“And should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare his<br>skin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove useful to your Serene<br>Highness.”<br><br>“Yes... Yes...” Kutúzov repeated, his laughing eye narrowing more and<br>more as he looked at Pierre.<br><br>Just then Borís, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to<br>Pierre’s side near Kutúzov and in a most natural manner, without<br>raising his voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted<br>conversation:<br><br>“The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die. What<br>heroism, Count!”<br><br>Borís evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his<br>Serene Highness. He knew Kutúzov’s attention would be caught by those<br>words, and so it was.<br><br>“What are you saying about the militia?” he asked Borís.<br><br>“Preparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness—for death—they have put on<br>clean shirts.”<br><br>“Ah... a wonderful, a matchless people!” said Kutúzov; and he closed his<br>eyes and swayed his head. “A matchless people!” he repeated with a sigh.<br><br>“So you want to smell gunpowder?” he said to Pierre. “Yes, it’s a<br>pleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of your wife’s adorers. Is<br>she well? My quarters are at your service.”<br><br>And as often happens with old people, Kutúzov began looking about<br>absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.<br><br>Then, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew<br>Kaysárov, his adjutant’s brother.<br><br>“Those verses... those verses of Márin’s... how do they go, eh? Those he<br>wrote about Gerákov: ‘Lectures for the corps inditing’... Recite them,<br>recite them!” said he, evidently preparing to laugh.<br><br>Kaysárov recited.... Kutúzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of<br>the verses.<br><br>When Pierre had left Kutúzov, Dólokhov came up to him and took his hand.<br><br>“I am very glad to meet you here, Count,” he said aloud, regardless<br>of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn<br>tone. “On the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us is fated to<br>survive, I am glad of this opportunity to tell you that I regret the<br>misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to<br>have any ill feeling for me. I beg you to forgive me.”<br><br>Pierre looked at Dólokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to him.<br>With tears in his eyes Dólokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him.<br><br>Borís said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to<br>Pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.<br><br>“It will interest you,” said he.<br><br>“Yes, very much,” replied Pierre.<br><br>Half an hour later Kutúzov left for Tatárinova, and Bennigsen and his<br>suite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the line.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXIII<br><br>From Górki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which, when<br>they had looked at it from the hill, the officer had pointed out as<br>being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay<br>lay by the riverside. They rode across that bridge into the village of<br>Borodinó and thence turned to the left, passing an enormous number of<br>troops and guns, and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging.<br>This was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, which afterwards became known as<br>the Raévski Redoubt, or the Knoll Battery, but Pierre paid no special<br>attention to it. He did not know that it would become more memorable to<br>him than any other spot on the plain of Borodinó.<br><br>They then crossed the hollow to Semënovsk, where the soldiers were<br>dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then they rode<br>downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by<br>hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows<br>of the plowed land, and reached some flèches * which were still being<br>dug.<br><br>    * A kind of entrenchment.<br><br>At the flèches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shevárdino<br>Redoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several<br>horsemen could be descried. The officers said that either Napoleon or<br>Murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of<br>horsemen. Pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the<br>scarcely discernible figures was Napoleon. At last those mounted men<br>rode away from the mound and disappeared.<br><br>Bennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began explaining<br>the whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to him, straining each<br>faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle, but<br>was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the<br>task. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen stopped speaking and,<br>noticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly said to him:<br><br>“I don’t think this interests you?”<br><br>“On the contrary it’s very interesting!” replied Pierre not quite<br>truthfully.<br><br>From the flèches they rode still farther to the left, along a road<br>winding through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the middle of the<br>wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the tramp of<br>the many horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front<br>of them for some time, arousing general attention and laughter, and only<br>when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear<br>in the thicket. After going through the wood for about a mile and a half<br>they came out on a glade where troops of Túchkov’s corps were stationed<br>to defend the left flank.<br><br>Here, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and with<br>much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great military<br>importance. In front of Túchkov’s troops was some high ground not<br>occupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake, saying<br>that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around<br>unoccupied and to place troops below it. Some of the generals expressed<br>the same opinion. One in particular declared with martial heat that they<br>were put there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen on his own authority ordered<br>the troops to occupy the high ground. This disposition on the left flank<br>increased Pierre’s doubt of his own capacity to understand military<br>matters. Listening to Bennigsen and the generals criticizing the<br>position of the troops behind the hill, he quite understood them and<br>shared their opinion, but for that very reason he could not understand<br>how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross<br>and palpable a blunder.<br><br>Pierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen supposed,<br>put there to defend the position, but were in a concealed position as<br>an ambush, that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an<br>approaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not know this and moved<br>the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the<br>matter to the commander in chief.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXIV<br><br>On that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on his<br>elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of Knyazkóvo at the further<br>end of his regiment’s encampment. Through a gap in the broken wall he<br>could see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty-year-old birches<br>with their lower branches lopped off, a field on which shocks of<br>oats were standing, and some bushes near which rose the smoke of<br>campfires—the soldiers’ kitchens.<br><br>Narrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to<br>him, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as<br>he had done seven years before at Austerlitz.<br><br>He had received and given the orders for next day’s battle and had<br>nothing more to do. But his thoughts—the simplest, clearest, and<br>therefore most terrible thoughts—would give him no peace. He knew that<br>tomorrow’s battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken<br>part in, and for the first time in his life the possibility of death<br>presented itself to him—not in relation to any worldly matter or with<br>reference to its effect on others, but simply in relation to himself, to<br>his own soul—vividly, plainly, terribly, and almost as a certainty. And<br>from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and<br>preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without<br>shadows, without perspective, without distinction of outline. All life<br>appeared to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he had long been<br>gazing by artificial light through a glass. Now he suddenly saw those<br>badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass. “Yes,<br>yes! There they are, those false images that agitated, enraptured,<br>and tormented me,” said he to himself, passing in review the principal<br>pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold<br>white daylight of his clear perception of death. “There they are, those<br>rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious.<br>Glory, the good of society, love of a woman, the Fatherland itself—how<br>important these pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they<br>seemed to be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the<br>cold white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me.” The<br>three great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular: his<br>love for a woman, his father’s death, and the French invasion which had<br>overrun half Russia. “Love... that little girl who seemed to me brimming<br>over with mystic forces! Yes, indeed, I loved her. I made romantic plans<br>of love and happiness with her! Oh, what a boy I was!” he said aloud<br>bitterly. “Ah me! I believed in some ideal love which was to keep her<br>faithful to me for the whole year of my absence! Like the gentle dove<br>in the fable she was to pine apart from me.... But it was much simpler<br>really.... It was all very simple and horrible.”<br><br>“When my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his<br>land, his air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and swept him aside,<br>unconscious of his existence, as he might brush a chip from his path,<br>and his Bald Hills and his whole life fell to pieces. Princess Mary says<br>it is a trial sent from above. What is the trial for, when he is not<br>here and will never return? He is not here! For whom then is the trial<br>intended? The Fatherland, the destruction of Moscow! And tomorrow I<br>shall be killed, perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one of our own<br>men, by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them<br>did yesterday, and the French will come and take me by head and heels<br>and fling me into a hole that I may not stink under their noses, and new<br>conditions of life will arise, which will seem quite ordinary to others<br>and about which I shall know nothing. I shall not exist....”<br><br>He looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with their<br>motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. “To die... to be<br>killed tomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this should still<br>be, but no me....”<br><br>And the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the<br>smoke of the campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed<br>terrible and menacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose<br>quickly, went out of the shed, and began to walk about.<br><br>After he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. “Who’s that?”<br>he cried.<br><br>The red-nosed Captain Timókhin, formerly Dólokhov’s squadron commander,<br>but now from lack of officers a battalion commander, shyly entered the<br>shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster.<br><br>Prince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they had come<br>about, gave them some further instructions, and was about to dismiss<br>them when he heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed.<br><br>“Devil take it!” said the voice of a man stumbling over something.<br><br>Prince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped<br>over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. It was<br>unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in general,<br>and Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful moments of<br>his last visit to Moscow.<br><br>“You? What a surprise!” said he. “What brings you here? This is<br>unexpected!”<br><br>As he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness—they<br>expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had approached<br>the shed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrew’s face he felt<br>constrained and ill at ease.<br><br>“I have come... simply... you know... come... it interests me,” said<br>Pierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word<br>“interesting.” “I wish to see the battle.”<br><br>“Oh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would they<br>stop it?” said Prince Andrew sarcastically. “Well, and how’s Moscow? And<br>my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?” he asked seriously.<br><br>“Yes, they have. Julie Drubetskáya told me so. I went to see them, but<br>missed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXV<br><br>The officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently<br>reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and have<br>tea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with<br>surprise at Pierre’s huge stout figure and listened to his talk of<br>Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince<br>Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre<br>addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.<br><br>“So you understand the whole position of our troops?” Prince Andrew<br>interrupted him.<br><br>“Yes—that is, how do you mean?” said Pierre. “Not being a military man<br>I can’t say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general<br>position.”<br><br>“Well, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may,” said<br>Prince Andrew.<br><br>“Oh!” said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince<br>Andrew. “Well, and what do you think of Kutúzov’s appointment?” he<br>asked.<br><br>“I was very glad of his appointment, that’s all I know,” replied Prince<br>Andrew.<br><br>“And tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are saying<br>heaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?”<br><br>“Ask them,” replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers.<br><br>Pierre looked at Timókhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile<br>with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.<br><br>“We see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your<br>excellency,” said Timókhin timidly, and continually turning to glance at<br>his colonel.<br><br>“Why so?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“Well, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you. Why, when<br>we were retreating from Sventsyáni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp<br>of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would get it all;<br>wasn’t it so, your excellency?” and again Timókhin turned to the prince.<br>“But we daren’t. In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for<br>that kind of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became<br>straightforward. Now we see light....”<br><br>“Then why was it forbidden?”<br><br>Timókhin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer<br>such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.<br><br>“Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the<br>enemy,” said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. “It is very sound:<br>one can’t permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to<br>marauding. At Smolénsk too he judged correctly that the French might<br>outflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could not understand<br>this,” cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him<br>involuntarily: “he could not understand that there, for the first time,<br>we were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the<br>men such as I had never seen before, that we had held the French for<br>two days, and that that success had increased our strength tenfold. He<br>ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and losses went for nothing.<br>He had no thought of betraying us, he tried to do the best he could,<br>he thought out everything, and that is why he is unsuitable. He is<br>unsuitable now, just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and<br>accurately as every German has to. How can I explain?... Well, say your<br>father has a German valet, and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your<br>father’s requirements better than you could, then it’s all right to let<br>him serve. But if your father is mortally sick you’ll send the valet<br>away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands,<br>and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could.<br>So it has been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could<br>serve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in danger<br>she needs one of her own kin. But in your Club they have been making him<br>out a traitor! They slander him as a traitor, and the only result will<br>be that afterwards, ashamed of their false accusations, they will make<br>him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor, and that will be still<br>more unjust. He is an honest and very punctilious German.”<br><br>“And they say he’s a skillful commander,” rejoined Pierre.<br><br>“I don’t understand what is meant by ‘a skillful commander,’” replied<br>Prince Andrew ironically.<br><br>“A skillful commander?” replied Pierre. “Why, one who foresees all<br>contingencies... and foresees the adversary’s intentions.”<br><br>“But that’s impossible,” said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter<br>settled long ago.<br><br>Pierre looked at him in surprise.<br><br>“And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?” he remarked.<br><br>“Yes,” replied Prince Andrew, “but with this little difference, that<br>in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not<br>limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is always<br>stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while<br>in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes<br>weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can<br>never be known to anyone. Believe me,” he went on, “if things<br>depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making<br>arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in<br>the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrow’s<br>battle will depend and not on those others.... Success never depends,<br>and never will depend, on position, or equipment, or even on numbers,<br>and least of all on position.”<br><br>“But on what then?”<br><br>“On the feeling that is in me and in him,” he pointed to Timókhin, “and<br>in each soldier.”<br><br>Prince Andrew glanced at Timókhin, who looked at his commander in alarm<br>and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity<br>Prince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from<br>expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.<br><br>“A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we lose<br>the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal to ours,<br>but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle,<br>and we did lose it. And we said so because we had nothing to fight for<br>there, we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could.<br>‘We’ve lost, so let us run,’ and we ran. If we had not said that till<br>the evening, heaven knows what might not have happened. But tomorrow we<br>shan’t say it! You talk about our position, the left flank weak and the<br>right flank too extended,” he went on. “That’s all nonsense, there’s<br>nothing of the kind. But what awaits us tomorrow? A hundred million most<br>diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that<br>our men or theirs run or do not run, and that this man or that man is<br>killed, but all that is being done at present is only play. The fact is<br>that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only<br>do not help matters, but hinder. They are only concerned with their own<br>petty interests.”<br><br>“At such a moment?” said Pierre reproachfully.<br><br>“At such a moment!” Prince Andrew repeated. “To them it is only a moment<br>affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross<br>or ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred<br>thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight, and<br>the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side<br>that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you<br>like I will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at<br>the top may make, we shall win tomorrow’s battle. Tomorrow, happen what<br>may, we shall win!”<br><br>“There now, your excellency! That’s the truth, the real truth,” said<br>Timókhin. “Who would spare himself now? The soldiers in my battalion,<br>believe me, wouldn’t drink their vodka! ‘It’s not the day for that!’<br>they say.”<br><br>All were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out of the shed<br>with them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had gone<br>Pierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a conversation<br>when they heard the clatter of three horses’ hoofs on the road not far<br>from the shed, and looking in that direction Prince Andrew recognized<br>Wolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack. They rode close by<br>continuing to converse, and Prince Andrew involuntarily heard these<br>words:<br><br>“Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht genug<br>Preis geben,” * said one of them.<br><br>     * “The war must be extended widely. I cannot sufficiently<br>     commend that view.”<br><br><br>“Oh, ja,” said the other, “der Zweck ist nur den Feind zu schwächen,<br>so kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung<br>nehmen.” *<br><br>     * “Oh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of<br>     course one cannot take into account the loss of private<br>     individuals.”<br><br><br>“Oh, no,” agreed the other.<br><br>“Extend widely!” said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they had<br>ridden past. “In that ‘extend’ were my father, son, and sister, at Bald<br>Hills. That’s all the same to him! That’s what I was saying to you—those<br>German gentlemen won’t win the battle tomorrow but will only make all<br>the mess they can, because they have nothing in their German heads but<br>theories not worth an empty eggshell and haven’t in their hearts the one<br>thing needed tomorrow—that which Timókhin has. They have yielded up all<br>Europe to him, and have now come to teach us. Fine teachers!” and again<br>his voice grew shrill.<br><br>“So you think we shall win tomorrow’s battle?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“Yes, yes,” answered Prince Andrew absently. “One thing I would do if<br>I had the power,” he began again, “I would not take prisoners. Why take<br>prisoners? It’s chivalry! The French have destroyed my home and are on<br>their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are outraging me<br>every moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are all criminals.<br>And so thinks Timókhin and the whole army. They should be executed!<br>Since they are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may have been<br>said at Tilsit.”<br><br>“Yes, yes,” muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince Andrew.<br>“I quite agree with you!”<br><br>The question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozháysk hill and all<br>that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He now<br>understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the<br>impending battle. All he had seen that day, all the significant and<br>stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing, were lit up<br>for him by a new light. He understood that latent heat (as they say in<br>physics) of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen,<br>and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly, and as<br>it were lightheartedly.<br><br>“Not take prisoners,” Prince Andrew continued: “That by itself would<br>quite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have<br>played at war—that’s what’s vile! We play at magnanimity and all that<br>stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and<br>sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she<br>is so kindhearted that she can’t look at blood, but enjoys eating the<br>calf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of<br>chivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on. It’s<br>all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged<br>us and we humbugged them. They plunder other people’s houses, issue<br>false paper money, and worst of all they kill my children and my<br>father, and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes! Take no<br>prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who has come to this as I have<br>through the same sufferings...”<br><br>Prince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or<br>not Moscow was taken as Smolénsk had been, was suddenly checked in his<br>speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a<br>few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips<br>quivered as he began speaking.<br><br>“If there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only<br>when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would<br>not be war because Paul Ivánovich had offended Michael Ivánovich. And<br>when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the<br>determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these<br>Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow<br>him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia<br>without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in<br>life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to<br>accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in<br>that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is<br>now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military<br>calling is the most highly honored.<br><br>“But what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the<br>habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war<br>are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country’s<br>inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud<br>and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class<br>are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance,<br>cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the<br>highest class, respected by everyone. All the kings, except the Chinese,<br>wear military uniforms, and he who kills most people receives the<br>highest rewards.<br><br>“They meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they kill<br>and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services for<br>having killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number), and they<br>announce a victory, supposing that the more people they have killed<br>the greater their achievement. How does God above look at them and hear<br>them?” exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill, piercing voice. “Ah, my<br>friend, it has of late become hard for me to live. I see that I have<br>begun to understand too much. And it doesn’t do for man to taste of the<br>tree of knowledge of good and evil.... Ah, well, it’s not for long!” he<br>added.<br><br>“However, you’re sleepy, and it’s time for me to sleep. Go back to<br>Górki!” said Prince Andrew suddenly.<br><br>“Oh no!” Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened,<br>compassionate eyes.<br><br>“Go, go! Before a battle one must have one’s sleep out,” repeated Prince<br>Andrew.<br><br>He came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. “Good-by, be<br>off!” he shouted. “Whether we meet again or not...” and turning away<br>hurriedly he entered the shed.<br><br>It was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the<br>expression of Prince Andrew’s face was angry or tender.<br><br>For some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow<br>him or go away. “No, he does not want it!” Pierre concluded. “And I know<br>that this is our last meeting!” He sighed deeply and rode back to Górki.<br><br>On re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but he could<br>not sleep.<br><br>He closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his imagination. On<br>one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled an evening<br>in Petersburg. Natásha with animated and excited face was telling him<br>how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost<br>her way in the big forest. She incoherently described the depths of<br>the forest, her feelings, and a talk with a beekeeper she met, and<br>constantly interrupted her story to say: “No, I can’t! I’m not telling<br>it right; no, you don’t understand,” though he encouraged her by saying<br>that he did understand, and he really had understood all she wanted to<br>say. But Natásha was not satisfied with her own words: she felt that<br>they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced<br>that day and wished to convey. “He was such a delightful old man, and<br>it was so dark in the forest... and he had such kind... No, I can’t<br>describe it,” she had said, flushed and excited. Prince Andrew smiled<br>now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes. “I<br>understood her,” he thought. “I not only understood her, but it was just<br>that inner, spiritual force, that sincerity, that frankness of soul—that<br>very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her body—it was that<br>soul I loved in her... loved so strongly and happily...” and suddenly<br>he remembered how his love had ended. “He did not need anything of that<br>kind. He neither saw nor understood anything of the sort. He only saw in<br>her a pretty and fresh young girl, with whom he did not deign to unite<br>his fate. And I?... and he is still alive and gay!”<br><br>Prince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again began<br>pacing up and down in front of the shed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXVI<br><br>On August 25, the eve of the battle of Borodinó, M. de Beausset, prefect<br>of the French Emperor’s palace, arrived at Napoleon’s quarters at<br>Valúevo with Colonel Fabvier, the former from Paris and the latter from<br>Madrid.<br><br>Donning his court uniform, M. de Beausset ordered a box he had<br>brought for the Emperor to be carried before him and entered the first<br>compartment of Napoleon’s tent, where he began opening the box while<br>conversing with Napoleon’s aides-de-camp who surrounded him.<br><br>Fabvier, not entering the tent, remained at the entrance talking to some<br>generals of his acquaintance.<br><br>The Emperor Napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his<br>toilet. Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now his back and<br>now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing<br>him down. Another valet, with his finger over the mouth of a bottle,<br>was sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor’s pampered body with an<br>expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much Eau<br>de Cologne should be sprinkled. Napoleon’s short hair was wet and<br>matted on the forehead, but his face, though puffy and yellow, expressed<br>physical satisfaction. “Go on, harder, go on!” he muttered to the valet<br>who was rubbing him, slightly twitching and grunting. An aide-de-camp,<br>who had entered the bedroom to report to the Emperor the number of<br>prisoners taken in yesterday’s action, was standing by the door after<br>delivering his message, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon,<br>frowning, looked at him from under his brows.<br><br>“No prisoners!” said he, repeating the aide-de-camp’s words. “They<br>are forcing us to exterminate them. So much the worse for the Russian<br>army.... Go on... harder, harder!” he muttered, hunching his back and<br>presenting his fat shoulders.<br><br>“All right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too,” he said,<br>nodding to the aide-de-camp.<br><br>“Yes, sire,” and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of the<br>tent.<br><br>Two valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform of<br>the Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.<br><br>De Beausset’s hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present<br>he had brought from the Empress, on two chairs directly in front of the<br>entrance. But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected<br>rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise.<br><br>Napoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were<br>not ready. He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him<br>a surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to<br>him, listening silently and with a stern frown to what Fabvier told him<br>of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, at<br>the other end of Europe, with but one thought—to be worthy of their<br>Emperor—and but one fear—to fail to please him. The result of that<br>battle had been deplorable. Napoleon made ironic remarks during<br>Fabvier’s account, as if he had not expected that matters could go<br>otherwise in his absence.<br><br>“I must make up for that in Moscow,” said Napoleon. “I’ll see you<br>later,” he added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had<br>prepared the surprise, having placed something on the chairs and covered<br>it with a cloth.<br><br>De Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the<br>old retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him,<br>presenting an envelope.<br><br>Napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.<br><br>“You have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?” he<br>asked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial<br>tone.<br><br>“Sire, all Paris regrets your absence,” replied de Beausset as was<br>proper.<br><br>But though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of this<br>kind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he was<br>pleased to hear it from him. Again he honored him by touching his ear.<br><br>“I am very sorry to have made you travel so far,” said he.<br><br>“Sire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of Moscow,”<br>replied de Beausset.<br><br>Napoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent-mindedly, glanced to the<br>right. An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a<br>gold snuffbox, which he took.<br><br>“Yes, it has happened luckily for you,” he said, raising the open<br>snuffbox to his nose. “You are fond of travel, and in three days you<br>will see Moscow. You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic capital.<br>You will have a pleasant journey.”<br><br>De Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel (of<br>which he had not till then been aware).<br><br>“Ha, what’s this?” asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers were<br>looking at something concealed under a cloth.<br><br>With courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without turning his<br>back to the Emperor retired two steps, twitching off the cloth at the<br>same time, and said:<br><br>“A present to Your Majesty from the Empress.”<br><br>It was a portrait, painted in bright colors by Gérard, of the son borne<br>to Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy whom for<br>some reason everyone called “The King of Rome.”<br><br>A very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the Sistine<br>Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball represented the<br>terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.<br><br>Though it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting<br>the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory<br>apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all who had seen it in<br>Paris, quite clear and very pleasing.<br><br>“The King of Rome!” he said, pointing to the portrait with a graceful<br>gesture. “Admirable!”<br><br>With the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the expression of<br>his face at will, he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look<br>of pensive tenderness. He felt that what he now said and did would be<br>historical, and it seemed to him that it would now be best for him—whose<br>grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial<br>globe—to show, in contrast to that grandeur, the simplest paternal<br>tenderness. His eyes grew dim, he moved forward, glanced round at a<br>chair (which seemed to place itself under him), and sat down on it<br>before the portrait. At a single gesture from him everyone went out on<br>tiptoe, leaving the great man to himself and his emotion.<br><br>Having sat still for a while he touched—himself not knowing why—the<br>thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait,<br>rose, and recalled de Beausset and the officer on duty. He ordered the<br>portrait to be carried outside his tent, that the Old Guard, stationed<br>round it, might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the King of<br>Rome, the son and heir of their adored monarch.<br><br>And while he was doing M. de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with<br>him, they heard, as Napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of the<br>officers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the portrait.<br><br>“Vive l’Empereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive l’Empereur!” came those<br>ecstatic cries.<br><br>After breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset’s presence dictated his order of<br>the day to the army.<br><br>“Short and energetic!” he remarked when he had read over the<br>proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections. It<br>ran:<br><br>Soldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depends on<br>you. It is essential for us; it will give us all we need: comfortable<br>quarters and a speedy return to our country. Behave as you did at<br>Austerlitz, Friedland, Vítebsk, and Smolénsk. Let our remotest posterity<br>recall your achievements this day with pride. Let it be said of each of<br>you: “He was in the great battle before Moscow!”<br><br>“Before Moscow!” repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who was<br>so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of the tent<br>to where the horses stood saddled.<br><br>“Your Majesty is too kind!” replied de Beausset to the invitation to<br>accompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride and<br>was afraid of doing so.<br><br>But Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount. When<br>Napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guards before his<br>son’s portrait grew still louder. Napoleon frowned.<br><br>“Take him away!” he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to<br>the portrait. “It is too soon for him to see a field of battle.”<br><br>De Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to<br>indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the Emperor’s words.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXVII<br><br>On the twenty-fifth of August, so his historians tell us, Napoleon spent<br>the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality, considering plans<br>submitted to him by his marshals, and personally giving commands to his<br>generals.<br><br>The original line of the Russian forces along the river Kolochá had<br>been dislocated by the capture of the Shevárdino Redoubt on the<br>twenty-fourth, and part of the line—the left flank—had been drawn back.<br>That part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground<br>was more open and level than elsewhere. It was evident to anyone,<br>military or not, that it was here the French should attack. It would<br>seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion,<br>nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the Emperor and his<br>marshals, nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality<br>called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to Napoleon; yet the<br>historians who described the event later and the men who then surrounded<br>Napoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.<br><br>Napoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound<br>air and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously,<br>and without communicating to the generals around him the profound<br>course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final<br>conclusions in the form of commands. Having listened to a suggestion<br>from Davout, who was now called Prince d’Eckmühl, to turn the Russian<br>left wing, Napoleon said it should not be done, without explaining<br>why not. To a proposal made by General Campan (who was to attack the<br>flèches) to lead his division through the woods, Napoleon agreed, though<br>the so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to remark that a movement<br>through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division.<br><br>Having inspected the country opposite the Shevárdino Redoubt, Napoleon<br>pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two<br>batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the Russian<br>entrenchments, and the places where, in line with them, the field<br>artillery should be placed.<br><br>After giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and the<br>dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.<br><br>These dispositions, of which the French historians write with enthusiasm<br>and other historians with profound respect, were as follows:<br><br>At dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the<br>plain occupied by the Prince d’Eckmühl will open fire on the opposing<br>batteries of the enemy.<br><br>At the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st Corps,<br>General Pernetti, with thirty cannon of Campan’s division and all the<br>howitzers of Dessaix’s and Friant’s divisions, will move forward, open<br>fire, and overwhelm with shellfire the enemy’s battery, against which<br>will operate:<br><br>        24 guns of the artillery of the Guards<br>        30 guns of Campan’s division<br><br> and     8 guns of Friant’s and Dessaix’s divisions<br>        —<br><br> in all 62 guns.<br><br>The commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General Fouché, will<br>place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all, on the<br>flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left,<br>which will have forty guns in all directed against it.<br><br>General Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the<br>howitzers of the Guard’s artillery against either one or other of the<br>entrenchments.<br><br>During the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the wood<br>on the village and turn the enemy’s position.<br><br>General Campan will move through the wood to seize the first<br>fortification.<br><br>After the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given in<br>accordance with the enemy’s movements.<br><br>The cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the<br>right wing are heard. The sharpshooters of Morand’s division and of<br>the vice-King’s division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack<br>commence on the right wing.<br><br>The vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges,<br>advancing to the same heights as Morand’s and Gibrard’s divisions, which<br>under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into<br>line with the rest of the forces.<br><br>All this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et<br>méthode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.<br><br>The Imperial Camp near Mozháysk,<br><br>September, 6, 1812.<br><br><br>These dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one allows<br>oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius,<br>related to Napoleon’s orders to deal with four points—four different<br>orders. Not one of these was, or could be, carried out.<br><br>In the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the<br>spot chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and Fouché; which<br>were to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and<br>shower shells on the Russian flèches and redoubts. This could not be<br>done, as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not<br>carry to the Russian works, and those 102 guns shot into the air until<br>the nearest commander, contrary to Napoleon’s instructions, moved them<br>forward.<br><br>The second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village through the<br>wood, should turn the Russian left flank. This could not be done and<br>was not done, because Poniatowski, advancing on the village through the<br>wood, met Túchkov there barring his way, and could not and did not turn<br>the Russian position.<br><br>The third order was: General Campan will move through the wood to seize<br>the first fortification. General Campan’s division did not seize the<br>first fortification but was driven back, for on emerging from the wood<br>it had to reform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was unaware.<br><br>The fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village (Borodinó)<br>and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as<br>Morand’s and Gérard’s divisions (for whose movements no directions are<br>given), which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt<br>and come into line with the rest of the forces.<br><br>As far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible<br>sentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders<br>given him, he was to advance from the left through Borodinó to the<br>redoubt while the divisions of Morand and Gérard were to advance<br>simultaneously from the front.<br><br>All this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could<br>not be executed. After passing through Borodinó the vice-King was driven<br>back to the Kolochá and could get no farther; while the divisions of<br>Morand and Gérard did not take the redoubt but were driven back, and the<br>redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry (a thing<br>probably unforeseen and not heard of by Napoleon). So not one of<br>the orders in the disposition was, or could be, executed. But in the<br>disposition it is said that, after the fight has commenced in this<br>manner, orders will be given in accordance with the enemy’s movements,<br>and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be<br>made by Napoleon during the battle. But this was not and could not be<br>done, for during the whole battle Napoleon was so far away that, as<br>appeared later, he could not know the course of the battle and not one<br>of his orders during the fight could be executed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXVIII<br><br>Many historians say that the French did not win the battle of Borodinó<br>because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the<br>orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more<br>full of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face of the world<br>have been changed. To historians who believe that Russia was shaped<br>by the will of one man—Peter the Great—and that France from a republic<br>became an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one<br>man—Napoleon—to say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a<br>bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing.<br><br>If it had depended on Napoleon’s will to fight or not to fight the<br>battle of Borodinó, and if this or that other arrangement depended on<br>his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will<br>might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring<br>Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been<br>the savior of Russia. Along that line of thought such a deduction is<br>indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction Voltaire made in jest<br>(without knowing what he was jesting at) when he saw that the Massacre<br>of St. Bartholomew was due to Charles IX’s stomach being deranged. But<br>to men who do not admit that Russia was formed by the will of one man,<br>Peter I, or that the French Empire was formed and the war with Russia<br>begun by the will of one man, Napoleon, that argument seems not merely<br>untrue and irrational, but contrary to all human reality. To the<br>question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself,<br>namely, that the course of human events is predetermined from on<br>high—depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the<br>events, and that a Napoleon’s influence on the course of these events is<br>purely external and fictitious.<br><br>Strange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the Massacre of<br>St. Bartholomew was not due to Charles IX’s will, though he gave the<br>order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order; and<br>strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand<br>men at Borodinó was not due to Napoleon’s will, though he ordered the<br>commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done<br>because he ordered it; strange as these suppositions appear, yet human<br>dignity—which tells me that each of us is, if not more at least not less<br>a man than the great Napoleon—demands the acceptance of that solution of<br>the question, and historic investigation abundantly confirms it.<br><br>At the battle of Borodinó Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one.<br>That was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who killed<br>people.<br><br>The French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of Borodinó<br>not because of Napoleon’s orders but by their own volition. The whole<br>army—French, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutch—hungry, ragged, and<br>weary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army blocking their road<br>to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk. Had Napoleon then<br>forbidden them to fight the Russians, they would have killed him and<br>have proceeded to fight the Russians because it was inevitable.<br><br>When they heard Napoleon’s proclamation offering them, as compensation<br>for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about their having been<br>in the battle before Moscow, they cried “Vive l’Empereur!” just as they<br>had cried “Vive l’Empereur!” at the sight of the portrait of the boy<br>piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick, and just as they would<br>have cried “Vive l’Empereur!” at any nonsense that might be told them.<br>There was nothing left for them to do but cry “Vive l’Empereur!” and go<br>to fight, in order to get food and rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it<br>was not because of Napoleon’s commands that they killed their fellow<br>men.<br><br>And it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for none<br>of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what<br>was going on before him. So the way in which these people killed one<br>another was not decided by Napoleon’s will but occurred independently of<br>him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took<br>part in the common action. It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took<br>place by his will. And so the question whether he had or had not a<br>cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the<br>transport soldiers.<br><br>Moreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was<br>the cause of his dispositions not being as well-planned as on former<br>occasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as<br>previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleon’s cold on<br>the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.<br><br>The dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even<br>better, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories. His<br>pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly, but<br>much the same as usual. These dispositions and orders only seem worse<br>than previous ones because the battle of Borodinó was the first Napoleon<br>did not win. The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders<br>seem very bad, and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks<br>of importance, when they relate to a battle that has been lost, and the<br>very worst dispositions and orders seem very good, and serious people<br>fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a<br>battle that has been won.<br><br>The dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz were<br>a model of perfection for that kind of composition, but still they were<br>criticized—criticized for their very perfection, for their excessive<br>minuteness.<br><br>Napoleon at the battle of Borodinó fulfilled his office as<br>representative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other<br>battles. He did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he<br>inclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did not<br>contradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the field of<br>battle, but with his great tact and military experience carried out his<br>role of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXIX<br><br>On returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon remarked:<br><br>“The chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!”<br><br>Having ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he began to talk to him<br>about Paris and about some changes he meant to make in the Empress’<br>household, surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details<br>relating to the court.<br><br>He showed an interest in trifles, joked about de Beausset’s love of<br>travel, and chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon who<br>knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron<br>while a patient is being strapped to the operating table. “The matter is<br>in my hands and is clear and definite in my head. When the time comes to<br>set to work I shall do it as no one else could, but now I can jest, and<br>the more I jest and the calmer I am the more tranquil and confident you<br>ought to be, and the more amazed at my genius.”<br><br>Having finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to rest before<br>the serious business which, he considered, awaited him next day. He<br>was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep, and<br>in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the<br>evening, he went into the large division of the tent at three o’clock in<br>the morning, loudly blowing his nose. He asked whether the Russians had<br>not withdrawn, and was told that the enemy’s fires were still in the<br>same places. He nodded approval.<br><br>The adjutant in attendance came into the tent.<br><br>“Well, Rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?” Napoleon<br>asked him.<br><br>“Without doubt, sire,” replied Rapp.<br><br>Napoleon looked at him.<br><br>“Do you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at Smolénsk?”<br>continued Rapp. “The wine is drawn and must be drunk.”<br><br>Napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his<br>hand.<br><br>“This poor army!” he suddenly remarked. “It has diminished greatly since<br>Smolénsk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always said so<br>and I am beginning to experience it. But the Guards, Rapp, the Guards<br>are intact?” he remarked interrogatively.<br><br>“Yes, sire,” replied Rapp.<br><br>Napoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his watch.<br>He was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. It was impossible<br>to give further orders for the sake of killing time, for the orders had<br>all been given and were now being executed.<br><br>“Have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the<br>Guards?” asked Napoleon sternly.<br><br>“Yes, sire.”<br><br>“The rice too?”<br><br>Rapp replied that he had given the Emperor’s order about the rice, but<br>Napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that<br>his order had been executed. An attendant came in with punch. Napoleon<br>ordered another glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently sipped his<br>own.<br><br>“I have neither taste nor smell,” he remarked, sniffing at his glass.<br>“This cold is tiresome. They talk about medicine—what is the good of<br>medicine when it can’t cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges but<br>they don’t help at all. What can doctors cure? One can’t cure anything.<br>Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that, it is its<br>nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it<br>will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies.<br>Our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time; the<br>watchmaker cannot open it, he can only adjust it by fumbling, and that<br>blindfold.... Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.”<br><br>And having entered on the path of definition, of which he was fond,<br>Napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.<br><br>“Do you know, Rapp, what military art is?” asked he. “It is the art of<br>being stronger than the enemy at a given moment. That’s all.”<br><br>Rapp made no reply.<br><br>“Tomorrow we shall have to deal with Kutúzov!” said Napoleon. “We shall<br>see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three weeks<br>and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments.... We shall<br>see!”<br><br>He looked at his watch. It was still only four o’clock. He did not feel<br>sleepy. The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do. He<br>rose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went<br>out of the tent. The night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible<br>moisture was descending from above. Near by, the campfires were dimly<br>burning among the French Guards, and in the distance those of the<br>Russian line shone through the smoke. The weather was calm, and the<br>rustle and tramp of the French troops already beginning to move to take<br>up their positions were clearly audible.<br><br>Napoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires and<br>listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman in<br>a shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn<br>himself up like a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon stopped<br>in front of him.<br><br>“What year did you enter the service?” he asked with that affectation<br>of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the<br>soldiers.<br><br>The man answered the question.<br><br>“Ah! One of the old ones! Has your regiment had its rice?”<br><br>“It has, Your Majesty.”<br><br>Napoleon nodded and walked away.<br><br><br>At half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of Shevárdino.<br><br>It was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud lay in<br>the east. The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the<br>faint morning light.<br><br>On the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in<br>the prevailing silence. Some minutes passed. A second and a third report<br>shook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the<br>right.<br><br>The first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out<br>and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another.<br><br>Napoleon with his suite rode up to the Shevárdino Redoubt where he<br>dismounted. The game had begun.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXX<br><br>On returning to Górki after having seen Prince Andrew, Pierre ordered<br>his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning,<br>and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner Borís<br>had given up to him.<br><br>Before he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left<br>the hut. The panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was<br>shaking him.<br><br>“Your excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!” he kept repeating<br>pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without looking at<br>him, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.<br><br>“What? Has it begun? Is it time?” Pierre asked, waking up.<br><br>“Hear the firing,” said the groom, a discharged soldier. “All the<br>gentlemen have gone out, and his Serene Highness himself rode past long<br>ago.”<br><br>Pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was bright,<br>fresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from behind a<br>cloud that had concealed it, was shining, with rays still half broken<br>by the clouds, over the roofs of the street opposite, on the<br>dew-besprinkled dust of the road, on the walls of the houses, on the<br>windows, the fence, and on Pierre’s horses standing before the hut. The<br>roar of guns sounded more distinct outside. An adjutant accompanied by a<br>Cossack passed by at a sharp trot.<br><br>“It’s time, Count; it’s time!” cried the adjutant.<br><br>Telling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down the<br>street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the<br>day before. A crowd of military men was assembled there, members of the<br>staff could be heard conversing in French, and Kutúzov’s gray head in<br>a white cap with a red band was visible, his gray nape sunk between his<br>shoulders. He was looking through a field glass down the highroad before<br>him.<br><br>Mounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before him,<br>spellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he had admired from that<br>spot the day before, but now the whole place was full of troops and<br>covered by smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting rays of the<br>bright sun, rising slightly to the left behind Pierre, cast upon it<br>through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy, golden-tinted<br>light and long dark shadows. The forest at the farthest extremity of<br>the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green<br>color; its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and<br>was pierced beyond Valúevo by the Smolénsk highroad crowded with troops.<br>Nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses.<br>There were troops to be seen everywhere, in front and to the right and<br>left. All this was vivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed<br>Pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself, of Borodinó<br>and the hollows on both sides of the Kolochá.<br><br>Above the Kolochá, in Borodinó and on both sides of it, especially to<br>the left where the Vóyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into<br>the Kolochá, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve, and to<br>become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored<br>and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns mingled with this mist,<br>and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning<br>sun were reflected, flashing back like lightning from the water, from<br>the dew, and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the<br>riverbanks and in Borodinó. A white church could be seen through the<br>mist, and here and there the roofs of huts in Borodinó as well as dense<br>masses of soldiers, or green ammunition chests and ordnance. And all<br>this moved, or seemed to move, as the smoke and mist spread out over<br>the whole space. Just as in the mist-enveloped hollow near Borodinó, so<br>along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods<br>and fields to the left, in the valleys and on the summits of the high<br>ground, clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of<br>nothing, now singly, now several at a time, some translucent, others<br>dense, which, swelling, growing, rolling, and blending, extended over<br>the whole expanse.<br><br>These puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of the firing<br>produced the chief beauty of the spectacle.<br><br>“Puff!”—suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from<br>violet into gray and milky white, and “boom!” came the report a second<br>later.<br><br>“Puff! puff!”—and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending<br>together; and “boom, boom!” came the sounds confirming what the eye had<br>seen.<br><br>Pierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a round<br>compact ball, and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating<br>to one side, and—“puff” (with a pause)—“puff, puff!” three and then four<br>more appeared and then from each, with the same interval—“boom—boom,<br>boom!” came the fine, firm, precise sounds in reply. It seemed as if<br>those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods,<br>fields, and glittering bayonets ran past them. From the left, over<br>fields and bushes, those large balls of smoke were continually appearing<br>followed by their solemn reports, while nearer still, in the hollows and<br>woods, there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time<br>to become balls, but had their little echoes in just the same way.<br>“Trakh-ta-ta-takh!” came the frequent crackle of musketry, but it was<br>irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon.<br><br>Pierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets, that<br>movement, and those sounds. He turned to look at Kutúzov and his suite,<br>to compare his impressions with those of others. They were all looking<br>at the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with the<br>same feelings. All their faces were now shining with that latent warmth<br>of feeling Pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood<br>after his talk with Prince Andrew.<br><br>“Go, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!” Kutúzov was<br>saying to a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from the<br>battlefield.<br><br>Having received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way down<br>the knoll.<br><br>“To the crossing!” said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one<br>of the staff who asked where he was going.<br><br>“I’ll go there too, I too!” thought Pierre, and followed the general.<br><br>The general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went to<br>his groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the quietest,<br>clambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out his toes<br>pressed his heels against its sides and, feeling that his spectacles<br>were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins, he<br>galloped after the general, causing the staff officers to smile as they<br>watched him from the knoll.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXI<br><br>Having descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping<br>turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, galloped<br>in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him. He tried to pass<br>either in front of them or to the right or left, but there were soldiers<br>everywhere, all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with<br>some unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the same<br>dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat,<br>who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horse’s<br>hoofs.<br><br>“Why ride into the middle of the battalion?” one of them shouted at him.<br><br>Another prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre,<br>bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse,<br>galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.<br><br>There was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood firing.<br>Pierre rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had come to the<br>bridge across the Kolochá between Górki and Borodinó, which the French<br>(having occupied Borodinó) were attacking in the first phase of the<br>battle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that<br>soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow,<br>among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the<br>smoke of the campfires the day before; but despite the incessant firing<br>going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle. He did<br>not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side, or the<br>projectiles that flew over him, did not see the enemy on the other side<br>of the river, and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded,<br>though many fell near him. He looked about him with a smile which did<br>not leave his face.<br><br>“Why’s that fellow in front of the line?” shouted somebody at him again.<br><br>“To the left!... Keep to the right!” the men shouted to him.<br><br>Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of Raévski’s<br>adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently<br>also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded.<br><br>“How have you got here?” he said, and galloped on.<br><br>Pierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid of<br>getting in someone’s way again, galloped after the adjutant.<br><br>“What’s happening here? May I come with you?” he asked.<br><br>“One moment, one moment!” replied the adjutant, and riding up to a stout<br>colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message and<br>then addressed Pierre.<br><br>“Why have you come here, Count?” he asked with a smile. “Still<br>inquisitive?”<br><br>“Yes, yes,” assented Pierre.<br><br>But the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.<br><br>“Here it’s tolerable,” said he, “but with Bagratión on the left flank<br>they’re getting it frightfully hot.”<br><br>“Really?” said Pierre. “Where is that?”<br><br>“Come along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and in<br>our battery it is still bearable,” said the adjutant. “Will you come?”<br><br>“Yes, I’ll come with you,” replied Pierre, looking round for his groom.<br><br>It was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being<br>carried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over the day<br>before, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay, with his<br>head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.<br><br>“Why haven’t they carried him away?” Pierre was about to ask, but seeing<br>the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way, he<br>checked himself.<br><br>Pierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the<br>adjutant to Raévski’s Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the adjutant’s<br>and jolted him at every step.<br><br>“You don’t seem to be used to riding, Count?” remarked the adjutant.<br><br>“No it’s not that, but her action seems so jerky,” said Pierre in a<br>puzzled tone.<br><br>“Why... she’s wounded!” said the adjutant. “In the off foreleg above the<br>knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your baptism of<br>fire!”<br><br>Having ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the artillery<br>which had been moved forward and was in action, deafening them with the<br>noise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was cool and quiet,<br>with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up<br>the hill on foot.<br><br>“Is the general here?” asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.<br><br>“He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,” someone told him,<br>pointing to the right.<br><br>The adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now.<br><br>“Don’t trouble about me,” said Pierre. “I’ll go up onto the knoll if I<br>may?”<br><br>“Yes, do. You’ll see everything from there and it’s less dangerous, and<br>I’ll come for you.”<br><br>Pierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not meet<br>again, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm that<br>day.<br><br>The knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known<br>to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Raévski’s Redoubt, and to the<br>French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du centre,<br>around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French regarded as<br>the key to the whole position.<br><br>This redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which trenches had<br>been dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired<br>through openings in the earthwork.<br><br>In line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired<br>incessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When ascending<br>that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which small trenches<br>had been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was the most<br>important point of the battle.<br><br>On the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought it one<br>of the least significant parts of the field.<br><br>Having reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench<br>surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with<br>an unconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he rose and walked about the<br>battery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the soldiers<br>who were loading, hauling the guns, and continually running past<br>him with bags and charges. The guns of that battery were being fired<br>continually one after another with a deafening roar, enveloping the<br>whole neighborhood in powder smoke.<br><br>In contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support,<br>here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were<br>separated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced a common and<br>as it were family feeling of animation.<br><br>The intrusion of Pierre’s nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an<br>unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at him with<br>surprise and even alarm as they went past him. The senior artillery<br>officer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over to Pierre as if<br>to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity.<br><br>A young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only just<br>out of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two guns<br>entrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly.<br><br>“Sir,” he said, “permit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not be<br>here.”<br><br>The soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre.<br>But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat<br>was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench<br>with a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up<br>and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard,<br>their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a<br>kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs,<br>cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that live with the<br>regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre into their family, adopted him,<br>gave him a nickname (“our gentleman”), and made kindly fun of him among<br>themselves.<br><br>A shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around<br>with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up.<br><br>“And how’s it you’re not afraid, sir, really now?” a red-faced,<br>broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a set<br>of sound, white teeth.<br><br>“Are you afraid, then?” said Pierre.<br><br>“What else do you expect?” answered the soldier. “She has no mercy, you<br>know! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards. One can’t<br>help being afraid,” he said laughing.<br><br>Several of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre.<br>They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and the<br>discovery that he did so delighted them.<br><br>“It’s the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman it’s wonderful!<br>There’s a gentleman for you!”<br><br>“To your places!” cried the young officer to the men gathered round<br>Pierre.<br><br>The young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or<br>second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with<br>great precision and formality.<br><br>The booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more<br>intense over the whole field, especially to the left where Bagratión’s<br>flèches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it<br>almost impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole<br>attention was engrossed by watching the family circle—separated from all<br>else—formed by the men in the battery. His first unconscious feeling of<br>joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield<br>was now replaced by another, especially since he had seen that soldier<br>lying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the slope of the trench, he<br>observed the faces of those around him.<br><br>By ten o’clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the<br>battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more<br>frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around.<br>But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and merry voices<br>and jokes were heard on all sides.<br><br>“A live one!” shouted a man as a whistling shell approached.<br><br>“Not this way! To the infantry!” added another with loud laughter,<br>seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports.<br><br>“Are you bowing to a friend, eh?” remarked another, chaffing a peasant<br>who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.<br><br>Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out to see<br>what was happening in front.<br><br>“They’ve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,” said they, pointing<br>over the earthwork.<br><br>“Mind your own business,” an old sergeant shouted at them. “If they’ve<br>retired it’s because there’s work for them to do farther back.”<br><br>And the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a<br>shove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter.<br><br>“To the fifth gun, wheel it up!” came shouts from one side.<br><br>“Now then, all together, like bargees!” rose the merry voices of those<br>who were moving the gun.<br><br>“Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman’s hat off!” cried the red-faced<br>humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. “Awkward baggage!” he added<br>reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man’s<br>leg.<br><br>“Now then, you foxes!” said another, laughing at some militiamen who,<br>stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.<br><br>“So this gruel isn’t to your taste? Oh, you crows! You’re scared!” they<br>shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg<br>had been torn off.<br><br>“There, lads... oh, oh!” they mimicked the peasants, “they don’t like it<br>at all!”<br><br>Pierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after<br>every loss, the liveliness increased more and more.<br><br>As the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and<br>rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in opposition to<br>what was taking place, the lightning of hidden fire growing more and<br>more intense glowed in the faces of these men.<br><br>Pierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know<br>what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire<br>which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the<br>same way in his own soul.<br><br>At ten o’clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of<br>the battery and along the Kámenka streamlet retreated. From the battery<br>they could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on<br>their muskets. A general with his suite came to the battery, and after<br>speaking to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look and went away again<br>having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down,<br>so as to be less exposed to fire. After this from amid the ranks of<br>infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts<br>of command, and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry<br>moved forward.<br><br>Pierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck<br>by a pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was walking<br>backwards and kept glancing uneasily around.<br><br>The ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their<br>long-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few<br>minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back from<br>that direction. Projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the<br>battery. Several men were lying about who had not been removed. Around<br>the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily. No one any<br>longer took notice of Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted at for being<br>in the way. The senior officer moved with big, rapid strides from one<br>gun to another with a frowning face. The young officer, with his face<br>still more flushed, commanded the men more scrupulously than ever. The<br>soldiers handed up the charges, turned, loaded, and did their business<br>with strained smartness. They gave little jumps as they walked, as<br>though they were on springs.<br><br>The stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire which<br>Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing beside the<br>commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his shako, ran up to<br>his superior.<br><br>“I have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left. Are<br>we to continue firing?” he asked.<br><br>“Grapeshot!” the senior shouted, without answering the question, looking<br>over the wall of the trench.<br><br>Suddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and bending<br>double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing. Everything<br>became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre’s eyes.<br><br>One cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork, a<br>soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before,<br>now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery soldiers shouting<br>“Hurrah!” were running not forwards but backwards, it seemed to Pierre.<br><br>A cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was<br>standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes<br>and at the same instant plumped into something. Some militiamen who were<br>entering the battery ran back.<br><br>“All with grapeshot!” shouted the officer.<br><br>The sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed<br>him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of<br>some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.<br><br>“The scoundrels! What are they doing?” shouted the officer, turning to<br>Pierre.<br><br>The officer’s face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under<br>his frowning brow.<br><br>“Run to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!” he yelled,<br>angrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men.<br><br>“I’ll go,” said Pierre.<br><br>The officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite side.<br><br>“Don’t fire.... Wait!” he shouted.<br><br>The man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against<br>Pierre.<br><br>“Eh, sir, this is no place for you,” said he, and ran down the slope.<br><br>Pierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer was<br>sitting.<br><br>One cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling in front,<br>beside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. “Where am I going?”<br>he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition<br>wagons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to return or go on.<br>Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground. At the<br>same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame, and immediately a<br>deafening roar, crackling, and whistling made his ears tingle.<br><br>When he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his<br>hands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed,<br>only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass, and a<br>horse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind it, galloped past, while<br>another horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground, uttering prolonged and<br>piercing cries.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXII<br><br>Beside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery,<br>as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him.<br><br>On entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something<br>there but that no shots were being fired from the battery. He had no<br>time to realize who these men were. He saw the senior officer lying on<br>the earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something<br>down below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was<br>struggling forward shouting “Brothers!” and trying to free himself from<br>some men who were holding him by the arm. He also saw something else<br>that was strange.<br><br>But he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed, that<br>the soldier shouting “Brothers!” was a prisoner, and that another man<br>had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had he run<br>into the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in a blue<br>uniform rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something. Instinctively<br>guarding against the shock—for they had been running together at full<br>speed before they saw one another—Pierre put out his hands and seized<br>the man (a French officer) by the shoulder with one hand and by the<br>throat with the other. The officer, dropping his sword, seized Pierre by<br>his collar.<br><br>For some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another’s<br>unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and<br>what they were to do next. “Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him<br>prisoner?” each was thinking. But the French officer was evidently more<br>inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because Pierre’s strong<br>hand, impelled by instinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever tighter and<br>tighter. The Frenchman was about to say something, when just above their<br>heads, terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled, and it seemed to Pierre<br>that the French officer’s head had been torn off, so swiftly had he<br>ducked it.<br><br>Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further thought<br>as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to the battery<br>and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who,<br>it seemed to him, caught at his feet. But before he reached the foot<br>of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian soldiers who,<br>stumbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and wildly toward<br>the battery. (This was the attack for which Ermólov claimed the credit,<br>declaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible:<br>it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some St. George’s<br>Crosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to<br>take who got there.)<br><br>The French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops shouting<br>“Hurrah!” pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult<br>to call them back.<br><br>The prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was<br>a wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds of<br>wounded—some known to Pierre and some unknown—Russians and French,<br>with faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were carried on<br>stretchers from the battery. Pierre again went up onto the knoll where<br>he had spent over an hour, and of that family circle which had received<br>him as a member he did not find a single one. There were many dead whom<br>he did not know, but some he recognized. The young officer still sat in<br>the same way, bent double, in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth<br>wall. The red-faced man was still twitching, but they did not carry him<br>away.<br><br>Pierre ran down the slope once more.<br><br>“Now they will stop it, now they will be horrified at what they have<br>done!” he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers<br>moving from the battlefield.<br><br>But behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front and<br>especially to the left, near Semënovsk, something seemed to be seething<br>in the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish, but<br>even increased to desperation like a man who, straining himself, shrieks<br>with all his remaining strength.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXIII<br><br>The chief action of the battle of Borodinó was fought within the seven<br>thousand feet between Borodinó and Bagratión’s flèches. Beyond that<br>space there was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the Russians<br>with Uvárov’s cavalry at midday, and on the other side, beyond Utítsa,<br>Poniatowski’s collision with Túchkov; but these two were detached and<br>feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the<br>battlefield. On the field between Borodinó and the flèches, beside the<br>wood, the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible<br>from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way.<br><br>The battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred<br>guns.<br><br>Then when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions,<br>Campan’s and Dessaix’s, advanced from the French right, while Murat’s<br>troops advanced on Borodinó from their left.<br><br>From the Shevárdino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the flèches were<br>two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as the crow flies<br>to Borodinó, so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there,<br>especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality.<br>The soldiers of Dessaix’s division advancing against the flèches could<br>only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and<br>the flèches. As soon as they had descended into that hollow, the smoke<br>of the guns and musketry on the flèches grew so dense that it covered<br>the whole approach on that side of it. Through the smoke glimpses could<br>be caught of something black—probably men—and at times the glint of<br>bayonets. But whether they were moving or stationary, whether they were<br>French or Russian, could not be discovered from the Shevárdino Redoubt.<br><br>The sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into<br>Napoleon’s face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked at the<br>flèches. The smoke spread out before them, and at times it looked as if<br>the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved. Sometimes shouts<br>were heard through the firing, but it was impossible to tell what was<br>being done there.<br><br>Napoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and in<br>its small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and sometimes<br>Russians, but when he looked again with the naked eye, he could not tell<br>where what he had seen was.<br><br>He descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it.<br><br>Occasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed intently at<br>the battlefield.<br><br>But not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where<br>he was standing down below, or from the knoll above on which some of his<br>generals had taken their stand, but even from the flèches themselves—in<br>which by this time there were now Russian and now French soldiers,<br>alternately or together, dead, wounded, alive, frightened, or<br>maddened—even at those flèches themselves it was impossible to make out<br>what was taking place. There for several hours amid incessant cannon and<br>musketry fire, now Russians were seen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now<br>infantry, and now cavalry: they appeared, fired, fell, collided, not<br>knowing what to do with one another, screamed, and ran back again.<br><br>From the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his<br>marshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress<br>of the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was<br>impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given<br>moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place<br>of conflict but reported what they had heard from others; and also<br>because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to Napoleon<br>circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming<br>false. Thus an adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings that<br>Borodinó had been occupied and the bridge over the Kolochá was in the<br>hands of the French. The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the<br>troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up<br>on the farther side and wait. But before that order was given—almost<br>as soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodinó—the bridge had been<br>retaken by the Russians and burned, in the very skirmish at which Pierre<br>had been present at the beginning of the battle.<br><br>An adjutant galloped up from the flèches with a pale and frightened face<br>and reported to Napoleon that their attack had been repulsed, Campan<br>wounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time the adjutant had been<br>told that the French had been repulsed, the flèches had in fact been<br>recaptured by other French troops, and Davout was alive and only<br>slightly bruised. On the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy<br>reports Napoleon gave his orders, which had either been executed before<br>he gave them or could not be and were not executed.<br><br>The marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle<br>but, like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and only<br>occasionally went within musket range, made their own arrangements<br>without asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to<br>fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run. But even<br>their orders, like Napoleon’s, were seldom carried out, and then but<br>partially. For the most part things happened contrary to their orders.<br>Soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers<br>ordered to remain where they were, suddenly, seeing Russians<br>unexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward,<br>and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying Russians.<br>In this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the Semënovsk hollow<br>and as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round and<br>galloped full speed back again. The infantry moved in the same way,<br>sometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered to<br>go to. All orders as to where and when to move the guns, when to send<br>infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the Russian infantry—all<br>such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the<br>units concerned, without asking either Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less<br>Napoleon. They did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling<br>orders or for acting on their own initiative, for in battle what is at<br>stake is what is dearest to man—his own life—and it sometimes seems that<br>safety lies in running back, sometimes in running forward; and these men<br>who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mood<br>of the moment. In reality, however, all these movements forward and<br>backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops. All<br>their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm, the harm of<br>disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over<br>the fields on which these men were floundering about. As soon as they<br>left the place where the balls and bullets were flying about, their<br>superiors, located in the background, re-formed them and brought them<br>under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them<br>back to the zone of fire, where under the influence of fear of death<br>they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance<br>promptings of the throng.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXIV<br><br>Napoleon’s generals—Davout, Ney, and Murat, who were near that region of<br>fire and sometimes even entered it—repeatedly led into it huge masses of<br>well-ordered troops. But contrary to what had always happened in their<br>former battles, instead of the news they expected of the enemy’s flight,<br>these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs.<br>The generals re-formed them, but their numbers constantly decreased.<br>In the middle of the day Murat sent his adjutant to Napoleon to demand<br>reinforcements.<br><br>Napoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when Murat’s<br>adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians would be routed<br>if His Majesty would let him have another division.<br><br>“Reinforcements?” said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at<br>the adjutant—a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like Murat’s<br>own—as though he did not understand his words.<br><br>“Reinforcements!” thought Napoleon to himself. “How can they need<br>reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a<br>weak, unentrenched Russian wing?”<br><br>“Tell the King of Naples,” said he sternly, “that it is not noon yet,<br>and I don’t yet see my chessboard clearly. Go!...”<br><br>The handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without<br>removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being<br>slaughtered.<br><br>Napoleon rose and having summoned Caulaincourt and Berthier began<br>talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle.<br><br>In the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to interest<br>Napoleon, Berthier’s eyes turned to look at a general with a suite, who<br>was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was Belliard.<br>Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid strides and in<br>a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending<br>reinforcements. He swore on his honor that the Russians were lost if the<br>Emperor would give another division.<br><br>Napoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down<br>without replying. Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the<br>generals of the suite around him.<br><br>“You are very fiery, Belliard,” said Napoleon, when he again came up to<br>the general. “In the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake. Go<br>and have another look and then come back to me.”<br><br>Before Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of the<br>battlefield galloped up.<br><br>“Now then, what do you want?” asked Napoleon in the tone of a man<br>irritated at being continually disturbed.<br><br>“Sire, the prince...” began the adjutant.<br><br>“Asks for reinforcements?” said Napoleon with an angry gesture.<br><br>The adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, but the<br>Emperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, came back, and<br>called Berthier.<br><br>“We must give reserves,” he said, moving his arms slightly apart.<br>“Who do you think should be sent there?” he asked of Berthier (whom he<br>subsequently termed “that gosling I have made an eagle”).<br><br>“Send Claparède’s division, sire,” replied Berthier, who knew all the<br>division’s regiments, and battalions by heart.<br><br>Napoleon nodded assent.<br><br>The adjutant galloped to Claparède’s division and a few minutes later<br>the Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward. Napoleon<br>gazed silently in that direction.<br><br>“No!” he suddenly said to Berthier. “I can’t send Claparède. Send<br>Friant’s division.”<br><br>Though there was no advantage in sending Friant’s division instead of<br>Claparède’s, and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping<br>Claparède and sending Friant now, the order was carried out exactly.<br>Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing<br>the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines—a role he so justly<br>understood and condemned.<br><br>Friant’s division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke<br>of the battlefield. From all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a<br>gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing. They all asked<br>for reinforcements and all said that the Russians were holding their<br>positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the French army was<br>melting away.<br><br>Napoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.<br><br>M. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since morning,<br>came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to His<br>Majesty.<br><br>“I hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?” said he.<br><br>Napoleon silently shook his head in negation. Assuming the negation to<br>refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M. de Beausset ventured<br>with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not<br>having lunch when one can get it.<br><br>“Go away...” exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned aside.<br><br>A beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on M. de<br>Beausset’s face and he glided away to the other generals.<br><br>Napoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an<br>ever-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money about and always<br>winning, suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the<br>game, finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he<br>loses.<br><br>His troops were the same, his generals the same, the same preparations<br>had been made, the same dispositions, and the same proclamation courte<br>et énergique, he himself was still the same: he knew that and knew that<br>he was now even more experienced and skillful than before. Even the<br>enemy was the same as at Austerlitz and Friedland—yet the terrible<br>stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent.<br><br>All the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success: the<br>concentration of batteries on one point, an attack by reserves to break<br>the enemy’s line, and a cavalry attack by “the men of iron,” all these<br>methods had already been employed, yet not only was there no victory,<br>but from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded,<br>of reinforcements needed, of the impossibility of driving back the<br>Russians, and of disorganization among his own troops.<br><br>Formerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered a<br>few phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with<br>congratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the<br>corps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon and<br>stores, and Murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather<br>in the baggage wagons. So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola, Jena,<br>Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now something strange was happening<br>to his troops.<br><br>Despite news of the capture of the flèches, Napoleon saw that this was<br>not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former<br>battles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about<br>him experienced in the art of war. All their faces looked dejected, and<br>they all shunned one another’s eyes—only a de Beausset could fail to<br>grasp the meaning of what was happening.<br><br>But Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of<br>a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all<br>efforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and that<br>the least accident might now—with the fight balanced on such a strained<br>center—destroy him and his army.<br><br>When he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign in<br>which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or cannon,<br>or army corps had been captured in two months, when he looked at the<br>concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the<br>Russians still holding their ground—a terrible feeling like a nightmare<br>took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy<br>him occurred to his mind. The Russians might fall on his left wing,<br>might break through his center, he himself might be killed by a stray<br>cannon ball. All this was possible. In former battles he had only<br>considered the possibilities of success, but now innumerable unlucky<br>chances presented themselves, and he expected them all. Yes, it was like<br>a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him,<br>and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows<br>should annihilate him, but then feels that his arm drops powerless and<br>limp like a rag, and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in<br>his helplessness.<br><br>The news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the French<br>army aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a campstool<br>below the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees. Berthier<br>approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to<br>ascertain the position of affairs.<br><br>“What? What do you say?” asked Napoleon. “Yes, tell them to bring me my<br>horse.”<br><br>He mounted and rode toward Semënovsk.<br><br>Amid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space through<br>which Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of blood, singly<br>or in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before<br>seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area. The roar of<br>guns, that had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the ear and gave<br>a peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does to tableaux<br>vivants. Napoleon rode up the high ground at Semënovsk, and through the<br>smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. They<br>were Russians.<br><br>The Russians stood in serried ranks behind Semënovsk village and its<br>knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent<br>forth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a continuous<br>slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French or the<br>Russians. Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie<br>from which Berthier had aroused him. He could not stop what was going on<br>before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to<br>depend on him, and from its lack of success this affair, for the first<br>time, seemed to him unnecessary and horrible.<br><br>One of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer to lead<br>the Old Guard into action. Ney and Berthier, standing near Napoleon,<br>exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this general’s senseless<br>offer.<br><br>Napoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.<br><br>“At eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard<br>destroyed!” he said, and turning his horse rode back to Shevárdino.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXV<br><br>On the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning sat<br>Kutúzov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He gave no<br>orders, but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.<br><br>“Yes, yes, do that,” he replied to various proposals. “Yes, yes: go,<br>dear boy, and have a look,” he would say to one or another of those<br>about him; or, “No, don’t, we’d better wait!” He listened to the reports<br>that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded<br>that of him; but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he<br>were not interested in the import of the words spoken, but rather in<br>something else—in the expression of face and tone of voice of those who<br>were reporting. By long years of military experience he knew, and with<br>the wisdom of age understood, that it is impossible for one man to<br>direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death, and he<br>knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a<br>commander in chief, nor the place where the troops are stationed, nor by<br>the number of cannon or of slaughtered men, but by that intangible force<br>called the spirit of the army, and he watched this force and guided it<br>in as far as that was in his power.<br><br>Kutúzov’s general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention,<br>and his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master<br>the fatigue of his old and feeble body.<br><br>At eleven o’clock they brought him news that the flèches captured by the<br>French had been retaken, but that Prince Bagratión was wounded. Kutúzov<br>groaned and swayed his head.<br><br>“Ride over to Prince Peter Ivánovich and find out about it exactly,” he<br>said to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of Württemberg<br>who was standing behind him.<br><br>“Will Your Highness please take command of the first army?”<br><br>Soon after the duke’s departure—before he could possibly have reached<br>Semënovsk—his adjutant came back from him and told Kutúzov that the duke<br>asked for more troops.<br><br>Kutúzov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokhtúrov to take over the<br>command of the first army, and a request to the duke—whom he said he<br>could not spare at such an important moment—to return to him. When<br>they brought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner, and the staff<br>officers congratulated him, Kutúzov smiled.<br><br>“Wait a little, gentlemen,” said he. “The battle is won, and there is<br>nothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is better to<br>wait before we rejoice.”<br><br>But he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.<br><br>When Scherbínin came galloping from the left flank with news that the<br>French had captured the flèches and the village of Semënovsk, Kutúzov,<br>guessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherbínin’s looks that the<br>news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking Scherbínin’s<br>arm, led him aside.<br><br>“Go, my dear fellow,” he said to Ermólov, “and see whether something<br>can’t be done.”<br><br>Kutúzov was in Górki, near the center of the Russian position. The<br>attack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several<br>times repulsed. In the center the French had not got beyond Borodinó,<br>and on their left flank Uvárov’s cavalry had put the French to flight.<br><br>Toward three o’clock the French attacks ceased. On the faces of all<br>who came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around him,<br>Kutúzov noticed an expression of extreme tension. He was satisfied with<br>the day’s success—a success exceeding his expectations, but the old<br>man’s strength was failing him. Several times his head dropped low as if<br>it were falling and he dozed off. Dinner was brought him.<br><br>Adjutant General Wolzogen, the man who when riding past Prince Andrew<br>had said, “the war should be extended widely,” and whom Bagratión so<br>detested, rode up while Kutúzov was at dinner. Wolzogen had come from<br>Barclay de Tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank.<br>The sagacious Barclay de Tolly, seeing crowds of wounded men running<br>back and the disordered rear of the army, weighed all the circumstances,<br>concluded that the battle was lost, and sent his favorite officer to the<br>commander in chief with that news.<br><br>Kutúzov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced<br>at Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids.<br><br>Wolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached Kutúzov with a<br>half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak of his<br>cap.<br><br>He treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance<br>intended to show that, as a highly trained military man, he left it to<br>Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but that he knew whom<br>he was dealing with. “Der alte Herr” (as in their own set the Germans<br>called Kutúzov) “is making himself very comfortable,” thought Wolzogen,<br>and looking severely at the dishes in front of Kutúzov he began to<br>report to “the old gentleman” the position of affairs on the left flank<br>as Barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood<br>it.<br><br>“All the points of our position are in the enemy’s hands and we cannot<br>dislodge them for lack of troops, the men are running away and it is<br>impossible to stop them,” he reported.<br><br>Kutúzov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen, as<br>if not understanding what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing “the old<br>gentleman’s” agitation, said with a smile:<br><br>“I have not considered it right to conceal from your Serene Highness<br>what I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder....”<br><br>“You have seen? You have seen?...” Kutúzov shouted. Frowning and rising<br>quickly, he went up to Wolzogen.<br><br>“How... how dare you!...” he shouted, choking and making a threatening<br>gesture with his trembling arms: “How dare you, sir, say that to me? You<br>know nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me that his information<br>is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to<br>me, the commander in chief, than to him.”<br><br>Wolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but Kutúzov interrupted him.<br><br>“The enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right<br>flank. If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say what<br>you don’t know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and inform<br>him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow,” said Kutúzov<br>sternly.<br><br>All were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of<br>the panting old general.<br><br>“They are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave army!<br>The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred<br>soil of Russia,” said Kutúzov crossing himself, and he suddenly sobbed<br>as his eyes filled with tears.<br><br>Wolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped silently<br>aside, marveling at “the old gentleman’s” conceited stupidity.<br><br>“Ah, here he is, my hero!” said Kutúzov to a portly, handsome,<br>dark-haired general who was just ascending the knoll.<br><br>This was Raévski, who had spent the whole day at the most important part<br>of the field of Borodinó.<br><br>Raévski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and<br>that the French no longer ventured to attack.<br><br>After hearing him, Kutúzov said in French:<br><br>“Then you do not think, like some others, that we must retreat?”<br><br>“On the contrary, your Highness, in indecisive actions it is always<br>the most stubborn who remain victors,” replied Raévski, “and in my<br>opinion...”<br><br>“Kaysárov!” Kutúzov called to his adjutant. “Sit down and write out<br>the order of the day for tomorrow. And you,” he continued, addressing<br>another, “ride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack.”<br><br>While Kutúzov was talking to Raévski and dictating the order of the day,<br>Wolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General Barclay wished to<br>have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given.<br><br>Kutúzov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the order to<br>be written out which the former commander in chief, to avoid personal<br>responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.<br><br>And by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains<br>throughout an army one and the same temper, known as “the spirit of<br>the army,” and which constitutes the sinew of war, Kutúzov’s words, his<br>order for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end of<br>the army to the other.<br><br>It was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the<br>farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth to mouth at<br>different ends of the army did not even resemble what Kutúzov had said,<br>but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was<br>not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a feeling that lay in<br>the commander in chief’s soul as in that of every Russian.<br><br>And on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and hearing<br>from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe,<br>the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXVI<br><br>Prince Andrew’s regiment was among the reserves which till after one<br>o’clock were stationed inactive behind Semënovsk, under heavy artillery<br>fire. Toward two o’clock the regiment, having already lost more than<br>two hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap<br>between Semënovsk and the Knoll Battery, where thousands of men perished<br>that day and on which an intense, concentrated fire from several hundred<br>enemy guns was directed between one and two o’clock.<br><br>Without moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here<br>lost another third of its men. From in front and especially from the<br>right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the mysterious<br>domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front, quick hissing<br>cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly. At times, as<br>if to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed during which<br>the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but sometimes several men<br>were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually<br>being dragged away and the wounded carried off.<br><br>With each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not<br>yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three hundred<br>paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same<br>mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely heard in the<br>ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful<br>shot and the cry of “stretchers!” was heard. Most of the time, by their<br>officers’ order, the men sat on the ground. One, having taken off his<br>shako, carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight<br>again; another, rubbing some dry clay between his palms, polished<br>his bayonet; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his<br>bandolier, while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put<br>his boots on again. Some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed<br>ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. All seemed<br>fully absorbed in these pursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when<br>rows of stretchers went past, when some troops retreated, and when great<br>masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any<br>attention to these things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or<br>some of our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval<br>were heard on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by<br>occurrences quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was<br>as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday,<br>commonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front of<br>the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace.<br>“Hey, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! She’ll fall.... Ah,<br>they don’t see it!” came identical shouts from the ranks all along the<br>regiment. Another time, general attention was attracted by a small brown<br>dog, coming heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner<br>in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell<br>close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, and darted<br>aside. Yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment. But<br>such distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had<br>been inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale<br>and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier.<br><br>Prince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment, paced up<br>and down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge of the<br>meadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind his back.<br>There was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given. Everything<br>went on of itself. The killed were dragged from the front, the wounded<br>carried away, and the ranks closed up. If any soldiers ran to the<br>rear they returned immediately and hastily. At first Prince Andrew,<br>considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them<br>an example, walked about among the ranks, but he soon became convinced<br>that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach<br>them. All the powers of his soul, as of every soldier there, were<br>unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their<br>situation. He walked along the meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the<br>grass, and gazing at the dust that covered his boots; now he took big<br>strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the<br>mowers, then he counted his steps, calculating how often he must walk<br>from one strip to another to walk a mile, then he stripped the flowers<br>from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his<br>palms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter scent. Nothing remained<br>of the previous day’s thoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened with<br>weary ears to the ever-recurring sounds, distinguishing the whistle<br>of flying projectiles from the booming of the reports, glanced at the<br>tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion, and<br>waited. “Here it comes... this one is coming our way again!” he thought,<br>listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke. “One,<br>another! Again! It has hit....” He stopped and looked at the ranks. “No,<br>it has gone over. But this one has hit!” And again he started trying<br>to reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five<br>paces from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared. A<br>chill ran down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks. Probably many<br>had been hit—a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion.<br><br>“Adjutant!” he shouted. “Order them not to crowd together.”<br><br>The adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince Andrew.<br>From the other side a battalion commander rode up.<br><br>“Look out!” came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird<br>whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell dropped<br>with little noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and close to the<br>battalion commander’s horse. The horse first, regardless of whether it<br>was right or wrong to show fear, snorted, reared almost throwing the<br>major, and galloped aside. The horse’s terror infected the men.<br><br>“Lie down!” cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground.<br><br>Prince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between him<br>and the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the field and<br>the meadow.<br><br>“Can this be death?” thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite new,<br>envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke<br>that curled up from the rotating black ball. “I cannot, I do not wish to<br>die. I love life—I love this grass, this earth, this air....” He thought<br>this, and at the same time remembered that people were looking at him.<br><br>“It’s shameful, sir!” he said to the adjutant. “What...”<br><br>He did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the sound of<br>an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame,<br>a suffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started to one side,<br>raising his arm, and fell on his chest. Several officers ran up to him.<br>From the right side of his abdomen, blood was welling out making a large<br>stain on the grass.<br><br>The militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the<br>officers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass,<br>breathing heavily and noisily.<br><br>“What are you waiting for? Come along!”<br><br>The peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs, but he<br>moaned piteously and, exchanging looks, they set him down again.<br><br>“Pick him up, lift him, it’s all the same!” cried someone.<br><br>They again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher.<br><br>“Ah, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That means death! My<br>God!”—voices among the officers were heard saying.<br><br>“It flew a hair’s breadth past my ear,” said the adjutant.<br><br>The peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, started<br>hurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to the dressing station.<br><br>“Keep in step! Ah... those peasants!” shouted an officer, seizing by<br>their shoulders and checking the peasants, who were walking unevenly and<br>jolting the stretcher.<br><br>“Get into step, Fëdor... I say, Fëdor!” said the foremost peasant.<br><br>“Now that’s right!” said the one behind joyfully, when he had got into<br>step.<br><br>“Your excellency! Eh, Prince!” said the trembling voice of Timókhin, who<br>had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.<br><br>Prince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the<br>stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids<br>drooped.<br><br><br>The militiamen carried Prince Andrew to the dressing station by the<br>wood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of<br>three tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood.<br>In the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were eating<br>oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the<br>grains that fell. Some crows, scenting blood, flew among the birch<br>trees cawing impatiently. Around the tents, over more than five acres,<br>bloodstained men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around the wounded<br>stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive<br>faces, whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the<br>spot. Disregarding the officers’ orders, the soldiers stood leaning<br>against their stretchers and gazing intently, as if trying to comprehend<br>the difficult problem of what was taking place before them. From the<br>tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans. Occasionally<br>dressers ran out to fetch water, or to point out those who were to be<br>brought in next. The wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents<br>groaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for vodka. Some were<br>delirious. Prince Andrew’s bearers, stepping over the wounded who had<br>not yet been bandaged, took him, as a regimental commander, close up to<br>one of the tents and there stopped, awaiting instructions. Prince Andrew<br>opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going<br>on around him. He remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the<br>whirling black ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life.<br>Two steps from him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and<br>attracting general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired<br>noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in the<br>head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his talk, a<br>crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.<br><br>“We kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, we grabbed<br>the King himself!” cried he, looking around him with eyes that glittered<br>with fever. “If only reserves had come up just then, lads, there<br>wouldn’t have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely....”<br><br>Like all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked at him with<br>shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. “But isn’t it all the<br>same now?” thought he. “And what will be there, and what has there been<br>here? Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was something in<br>this life I did not and do not understand.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXVII<br><br>One of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron,<br>holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small<br>bloodstained hands, so as not to smear it. He raised his head and looked<br>about him, but above the level of the wounded men. He evidently wanted a<br>little respite. After turning his head from right to left for some time,<br>he sighed and looked down.<br><br>“All right, immediately,” he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince<br>Andrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.<br><br>Murmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.<br><br>“It seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a<br>chance!” remarked one.<br><br>Prince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been<br>cleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince Andrew could not<br>make out distinctly what was in that tent. The pitiful groans from all<br>sides and the torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distracted<br>him. All he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked,<br>bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent, as<br>a few weeks previously, on that hot August day, such bodies had filled<br>the dirty pond beside the Smolénsk road. Yes, it was the same flesh,<br>the same chair à canon, the sight of which had even then filled him with<br>horror, as by a presentiment.<br><br>There were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied, and<br>on the third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while he was left<br>alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two<br>tables. On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a Cossack, judging by<br>the uniform thrown down beside him. Four soldiers were holding him, and<br>a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back.<br><br>“Ooh, ooh, ooh!” grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his swarthy<br>snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white teeth,<br>he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing, ringing,<br>and prolonged yells. On the other table, round which many people were<br>crowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back.<br>His curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head seemed strangely<br>familiar to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were pressing on his chest<br>to hold him down. One large, white, plump leg twitched rapidly all<br>the time with a feverish tremor. The man was sobbing and choking<br>convulsively. Two doctors—one of whom was pale and trembling—were<br>silently doing something to this man’s other, gory leg. When he had<br>finished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an overcoat, the<br>spectacled doctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his hands.<br><br>He glanced at Prince Andrew’s face and quickly turned away.<br><br>“Undress him! What are you waiting for?” he cried angrily to the<br>dressers.<br><br>His very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to Prince<br>Andrew’s mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to<br>undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The doctor bent<br>down over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he made a sign to<br>someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to<br>lose consciousness. When he came to himself the splintered portions of<br>his thighbone had been extracted, the torn flesh cut away, and the<br>wound bandaged. Water was being sprinkled on his face. As soon as Prince<br>Andrew opened his eyes, the doctor bent over, kissed him silently on the<br>lips, and hurried away.<br><br>After the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a<br>blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. All the<br>best and happiest moments of his life—especially his earliest childhood,<br>when he used to be undressed and put to bed, and when leaning over him<br>his nurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his head in the pillow,<br>felt happy in the mere consciousness of life—returned to his memory, not<br>merely as something past but as something present.<br><br>The doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose<br>head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him up and<br>trying to quiet him.<br><br>“Show it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!” his frightened moans could<br>be heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs.<br><br>Hearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep. Whether because he<br>was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to part with life,<br>or because of those memories of a childhood that could not return, or<br>because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him<br>was groaning so piteously—he felt like weeping childlike, kindly, and<br>almost happy tears.<br><br>The wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood<br>and with the boot still on.<br><br>“Oh! Oh, ooh!” he sobbed, like a woman.<br><br>The doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince Andrew<br>from seeing his face, moved away.<br><br>“My God! What is this? Why is he here?” said Prince Andrew to himself.<br><br>In the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been<br>amputated, he recognized Anatole Kurágin. Men were supporting him in<br>their arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling, swollen<br>lips could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully. “Yes, it is<br>he! Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me,”<br>thought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him.<br>“What is the connection of that man with my childhood and life?” he<br>asked himself without finding an answer. And suddenly a new unexpected<br>memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to<br>him. He remembered Natásha as he had seen her for the first time at the<br>ball in 1810, with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy<br>face ready for rapture, and love and tenderness for her, stronger<br>and more vivid than ever, awoke in his soul. He now remembered the<br>connection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly<br>gazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes. He remembered<br>everything, and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy<br>heart.<br><br>Prince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving<br>tears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own and their errors.<br><br>“Compassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for those<br>who hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God preached on<br>earth and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not understand—that is<br>what made me sorry to part with life, that is what remained for me had I<br>lived. But now it is too late. I know it!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br><br>The terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded,<br>together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty<br>generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded, and the<br>consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm, produced an<br>unexpected impression on Napoleon who usually liked to look at the<br>killed and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his strength of<br>mind. This day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame<br>that strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his<br>greatness. He rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the<br>Shevárdino knoll, where he sat on his campstool, his sallow face<br>swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his nose red, and his voice hoarse,<br>involuntarily listening, with downcast eyes, to the sounds of firing.<br>With painful dejection he awaited the end of this action, in which he<br>regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest.<br>A personal, human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the<br>artificial phantasm of life he had served so long. He felt in his own<br>person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield.<br>The heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility<br>of suffering and death for himself. At that moment he did not desire<br>Moscow, or victory, or glory (what need had he for any more glory?). The<br>one thing he wished for was rest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he<br>had been on the Semënovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed<br>to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to<br>strengthen the fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of Knyazkóvo.<br>Napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought<br>to him of the effect those batteries produced.<br><br>An adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns<br>had been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that they<br>still held their ground.<br><br>“Our fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on,” said the<br>adjutant.<br><br>“They want more!...” said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.<br><br>“Sire?” asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.<br><br>“They want more!” croaked Napoleon frowning. “Let them have it!”<br><br>Even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and for<br>which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him,<br>was being done. And he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary<br>greatness, and again—as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing<br>something for itself—he submissively fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy,<br>and inhuman role predestined for him.<br><br>And not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience<br>darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening<br>lay more than on all the others who took part in it. Never to the end<br>of his life could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the<br>significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and<br>truth, too remote from everything human, for him ever to be able to<br>grasp their meaning. He could not disavow his actions, belauded as they<br>were by half the world, and so he had to repudiate truth, goodness, and<br>all humanity.<br><br>Not only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men<br>killed and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he reckon as he<br>looked at them how many Russians there were for each Frenchman and,<br>deceiving himself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that<br>there were five Russians for every Frenchman. Not on that day alone<br>did he write in a letter to Paris that “the battle field was superb,”<br>because fifty thousand corpses lay there, but even on the island of St.<br>Helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his<br>leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done, he wrote:<br><br>The Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times:<br>it was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the tranquillity and<br>security of all; it was purely pacific and conservative.<br><br>It was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the<br>beginning of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening out,<br>full of well-being and prosperity for all. The European system was<br>already founded; all that remained was to organize it.<br><br>Satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, I<br>too should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance. Those ideas were<br>stolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have<br>discussed our interests like one family, and have rendered account to<br>the peoples as clerk to master.<br><br>Europe would in this way soon have been, in fact, but one people, and<br>anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the<br>common fatherland. I should have demanded the freedom of all navigable<br>rivers for everybody, that the seas should be common to all, and that<br>the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards<br>for the sovereigns.<br><br>On returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong, magnificent,<br>peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have proclaimed<br>her frontiers immutable; all future wars purely defensive, all<br>aggrandizement antinational. I should have associated my son in the<br>Empire; my dictatorship would have been finished, and his constitutional<br>reign would have begun.<br><br>Paris would have been the capital of the world, and the French the envy<br>of the nations!<br><br>My leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, in company<br>with the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son, to<br>leisurely visiting, with our own horses and like a true country couple,<br>every corner of the Empire, receiving complaints, redressing wrongs,<br>and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and<br>everywhere.<br><br>Napoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of executioner<br>of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the<br>peoples’ welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by<br>the employment of power confer benefactions.<br><br>“Of four hundred thousand who crossed the Vistula,” he wrote further<br>of the Russian war, “half were Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Poles,<br>Bavarians, Württembergers, Mecklenburgers, Spaniards, Italians, and<br>Neapolitans. The Imperial army, strictly speaking, was one third<br>composed of Dutch, Belgians, men from the borders of the Rhine,<br>Piedmontese, Swiss, Genevese, Tuscans, Romans, inhabitants of the<br>Thirty-second Military Division, of Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on: it<br>included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke French. The<br>Russian expedition actually cost France less than fifty thousand men;<br>the Russian army in its retreat from Vílna to Moscow lost in the various<br>battles four times more men than the French army; the burning of Moscow<br>cost the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who died of cold and want<br>in the woods; finally, in its march from Moscow to the Oder the Russian<br>army also suffered from the severity of the season; so that by the time<br>it reached Vílna it numbered only fifty thousand, and at Kálisch less<br>than eighteen thousand.”<br><br>He imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, and the<br>horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul. He boldly took the<br>whole responsibility for what happened, and his darkened mind found<br>justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who<br>perished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians and Bavarians.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXIX<br><br>Several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and<br>various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the Davýdov<br>family and to the crown serfs—those fields and meadows where for<br>hundreds of years the peasants of Borodinó, Górki, Shevárdino, and<br>Semënovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle. At the<br>dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space<br>of some three acres around. Crowds of men of various arms, wounded and<br>unwounded, with frightened faces, dragged themselves back to Mozháysk<br>from the one army and back to Valúevo from the other. Other crowds,<br>exhausted and hungry, went forward led by their officers. Others held<br>their ground and continued to fire.<br><br>Over the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of<br>bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now spread a<br>mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood.<br>Clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded,<br>on the frightened, exhausted, and hesitating men, as if to say: “Enough,<br>men! Enough! Cease... bethink yourselves! What are you doing?”<br><br>To the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and rest,<br>it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to<br>slaughter one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, and the<br>question arose in every soul: “For what, for whom, must I kill and be<br>killed?... You may go and kill whom you please, but I don’t want to do<br>so any more!” By evening this thought had ripened in every soul. At any<br>moment these men might have been seized with horror at what they were<br>doing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere.<br><br>But though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of<br>what they were doing, though they would have been glad to leave off,<br>some incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to control them, and<br>they still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed, and applied the match,<br>though only one artilleryman survived out of every three, and though<br>they stumbled and panted with fatigue, perspiring and stained with blood<br>and powder. The cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both<br>sides, crushing human bodies, and that terrible work which was not done<br>by the will of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds<br>continued.<br><br>Anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would have<br>said that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it would<br>disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army would have<br>said that the Russians need only make one more slight effort and the<br>French would be destroyed. But neither the French nor the Russians made<br>that effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly out.<br><br>The Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking<br>the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the<br>way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the<br>beginning. But even had the aim of the Russians been to drive the French<br>from their positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all<br>the Russian troops had been broken up, there was no part of the Russian<br>army that had not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their<br>positions they had lost ONE HALF of their army.<br><br>The French, with the memory of all their former victories during<br>fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleon’s invincibility, with the<br>consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had<br>lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards intact,<br>twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort. The French<br>who had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from its position<br>ought to have made that effort, for as long as the Russians continued to<br>block the road to Moscow as before, the aim of the French had not been<br>attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain. But the French<br>did not make that effort. Some historians say that Napoleon need only<br>have used his Old Guards, who were intact, and the battle would have<br>been won. To speak of what would have happened had Napoleon sent his<br>Guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring. It<br>could not be. Napoleon did not give his Guards, not because he did not<br>want to, but because it could not be done. All the generals, officers,<br>and soldiers of the French army knew it could not be done, because the<br>flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it.<br><br>It was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling<br>of the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and<br>soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not,<br>after all their experience of previous battles—when after one tenth of<br>such efforts the enemy had fled—experienced a similar feeling of terror<br>before an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as threateningly<br>at the end as at the beginning of the battle. The moral force of the<br>attacking French army was exhausted. Not that sort of victory which is<br>defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks, called<br>standards, and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were<br>standing, but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral<br>superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the<br>Russians at Borodinó. The French invaders, like an infuriated animal<br>that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound, felt that they were<br>perishing, but could not stop, any more than the Russian army, weaker<br>by one half, could help swerving. By impetus gained, the French army was<br>still able to roll forward to Moscow, but there, without further effort<br>on the part of the Russians, it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal<br>wound it had received at Borodinó. The direct consequence of the battle<br>of Borodinó was Napoleon’s senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat<br>along the old Smolénsk road, the destruction of the invading army of<br>five hundred thousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on<br>which at Borodinó for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger<br>spirit had been laid.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK ELEVEN: 1812<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>Absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind.<br>Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he<br>examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but at the<br>same time, a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary<br>division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements. There is a<br>well-known, so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in this, that<br>Achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following, in spite<br>of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise. By<br>the time Achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the<br>tortoise, the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead<br>of him: when Achilles has covered that tenth, the tortoise has covered<br>another one hundredth, and so on forever. This problem seemed to<br>the ancients insoluble. The absurd answer (that Achilles could never<br>overtake the tortoise) resulted from this: that motion was arbitrarily<br>divided into discontinuous elements, whereas the motion both of Achilles<br>and of the tortoise was continuous.<br><br>By adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a<br>solution of the problem, but never reach it.

But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all<br>those human wills, man’s mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected<br>units. The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected<br>series of continuous events and examine it apart from others, though<br>there is and can be no beginning to any event, for one event always<br>flows uninterruptedly from another.<br><br>The second method is to consider the actions of some one man—a king or a<br>commander—as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills; whereas the<br>sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single<br>historic personage.<br><br>Historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually<br>takes smaller and smaller units for examination. But however small the<br>units it takes, we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others,<br>or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon, or to say that the will of<br>many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage, is<br>in itself false.<br><br>It needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions<br>drawn from history.

Men leave their customary<br>pursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the other, plunder and<br>slaughter one another, triumph and are plunged in despair, and for some<br>years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive<br>movement which first increases and then slackens. What was the cause of<br>this movement, by what laws was it governed? asks the mind of man.<br><br>The historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings and<br>doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris, calling<br>these sayings and doings “the Revolution”; then they give a detailed<br>biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him;<br>tell of the influence some of these people had on others, and say: that<br>is why this movement took place and those are its laws.<br><br>But the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation, but<br>plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious, because in<br>it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger. The sum of<br>human wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, and only the sum of<br>those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them.<br><br>“But every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors;<br>every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been<br>great men,” says history. And, indeed, human reason replies: every time<br>conquerors appear there have been wars, but this does not prove that the<br>conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of<br>a war in the personal activity of a single man. Whenever I look at my<br>watch and its hands point to ten, I hear the bells of the neighboring<br>church; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock<br>reach ten, I have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is<br>caused by the position of the hands of the watch.<br><br>Whenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and see<br>the valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right to conclude<br>that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the<br>movement of the engine.<br><br>The peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks<br>are budding, and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak<br>is budding. But though I do not know what causes the cold winds to blow<br>when the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the peasants that the<br>unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind, for the<br>force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds. I see only a<br>coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of<br>life, and I see that however much and however carefully I observe the<br>hands of the watch, and the valves and wheels of the engine, and the<br>oak, I shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing, the engine<br>moving, or of the winds of spring. To that I must entirely change my<br>point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam, of the<br>bells, and of the wind. History must do the same. And attempts in this<br>direction have already been made.<br><br>To study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of<br>our observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and<br>study the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are<br>moved. No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance<br>in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it is<br>evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering<br>the laws of history lie, and that as yet not a millionth part as much<br>mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has<br>been devoted to describing the actions of various kings, commanders,<br>and ministers and propounding the historians’ own reflections concerning<br>these actions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>The forces of a dozen European nations burst into Russia. The Russian<br>army and people avoided a collision till Smolénsk was reached, and again<br>from Smolénsk to Borodinó. The French army pushed on to Moscow, its<br>goal, its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim, just as the<br>velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth. Behind<br>it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken, hostile country; ahead<br>were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal. Every soldier in<br>Napoleon’s army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum.<br><br>The more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred<br>of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army increased and<br>consolidated. At Borodinó a collision took place. Neither army was<br>broken up, but the Russian army retreated immediately after the<br>collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another<br>having a greater momentum, and with equal inevitability the ball<br>of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some<br>distance, though the collision had deprived it of all its force.<br><br>The Russians retreated eighty miles—to beyond Moscow—and the French<br>reached Moscow and there came to a standstill. For five weeks after that<br>there was not a single battle. The French did not move. As a bleeding,<br>mortally wounded animal licks its wounds, they remained inert in Moscow<br>for five weeks, and then suddenly, with no fresh reason, fled back:<br>they made a dash for the Kalúga road, and (after a victory—for at<br>Málo-Yaroslávets the field of conflict again remained theirs) without<br>undertaking a single serious battle, they fled still more rapidly back<br>to Smolénsk, beyond Smolénsk, beyond the Berëzina, beyond Vílna, and<br>farther still.<br><br>On the evening of the twenty-sixth of August, Kutúzov and the whole<br>Russian army were convinced that the battle of Borodinó was a victory.<br>Kutúzov reported so to the Emperor. He gave orders to prepare for a<br>fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone,<br>but because he knew that the enemy was beaten, as everyone who had taken<br>part in the battle knew it.<br><br>But all that evening and next day reports came in one after another<br>of unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and a fresh battle<br>proved physically impossible.<br><br>It was impossible to give battle before information had been collected,<br>the wounded gathered in, the supplies of ammunition replenished, the<br>slain reckoned up, new officers appointed to replace those who had been<br>killed, and before the men had had food and sleep. And meanwhile, the<br>very next morning after the battle, the French army advanced of itself<br>upon the Russians, carried forward by the force of its own momentum now<br>seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance<br>from its aim. Kutúzov’s wish was to attack next day, and the whole<br>army desired to do so. But to make an attack the wish to do so is not<br>sufficient, there must also be a possibility of doing it, and that<br>possibility did not exist. It was impossible not to retreat a day’s<br>march, and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another<br>and a third day’s march, and at last, on the first of September when<br>the army drew near Moscow—despite the strength of the feeling that had<br>arisen in all ranks—the force of circumstances compelled it to retire<br>beyond Moscow. And the troops retired one more, last, day’s march, and<br>abandoned Moscow to the enemy.<br><br>For people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are<br>made by generals—as anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may<br>imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle—the<br>questions present themselves: Why did Kutúzov during the retreat not do<br>this or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching Filí?<br>Why did he not retire at once by the Kalúga road, abandoning Moscow? and<br>so on. People accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know,<br>the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any<br>commander in chief. The activity of a commander in chief does not at all<br>resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in<br>our studies examining some campaign on the map, with a certain number of<br>troops on this and that side in a certain known locality, and begin our<br>plans from some given moment. A commander in chief is never dealing with<br>the beginning of any event—the position from which we always contemplate<br>it. The commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of<br>shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole<br>import of an event that is occurring. Moment by moment the event is<br>imperceptibly shaping itself, and at every moment of this continuous,<br>uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the<br>midst of a most complex play of intrigues, worries, contingencies,<br>authorities, projects, counsels, threats, and deceptions and is<br>continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him,<br>which constantly conflict with one another.<br><br>Learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kutúzov should<br>have moved his army to the Kalúga road long before reaching Filí, and<br>that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But a commander<br>in chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always before him not<br>one proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these proposals, based<br>on strategics and tactics, contradict each other.<br><br>A commander in chief’s business, it would seem, is simply to choose one<br>of these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and time do not<br>wait. For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to<br>cross to the Kalúga road, but just then an adjutant gallops up from<br>Milorádovich asking whether he is to engage the French or retire. An<br>order must be given him at once, that instant. And the order to retreat<br>carries us past the turn to the Kalúga road. And after the adjutant<br>comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken,<br>and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go, and a<br>courier from Petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does<br>not admit of the possibility of abandoning Moscow, and the commander in<br>chief’s rival, the man who is undermining him (and there are always<br>not merely one but several such), presents a new project diametrically<br>opposed to that of turning to the Kalúga road, and the commander in<br>chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and<br>a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of<br>rewards comes to complain, and the inhabitants of the district pray to<br>be defended, and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and<br>gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer<br>previously sent; and a spy, a prisoner, and a general who has been<br>on reconnaissance, all describe the position of the enemy’s army<br>differently. People accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these<br>inevitable conditions of a commander in chief’s actions describe to<br>us, for instance, the position of the army at Filí and assume that the<br>commander in chief could, on the first of September, quite freely decide<br>whether to abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army<br>less than four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had<br>that question been settled? At Drissa and at Smolénsk and most<br>palpably of all on the twenty-fourth of August at Shevárdino and on<br>the twenty-sixth at Borodinó, and each day and hour and minute of the<br>retreat from Borodinó to Filí.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>When Ermólov, having been sent by Kutúzov to inspect the position, told<br>the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before Moscow<br>and that they must retreat, Kutúzov looked at him in silence.<br><br>“Give me your hand,” said he and, turning it over so as to feel the<br>pulse, added: “You are not well, my dear fellow. Think what you are<br>saying!”<br><br>Kutúzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond Moscow<br>without a battle.<br><br>On the Poklónny Hill, four miles from the Dorogomílov gate of Moscow,<br>Kutúzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside.<br>A great crowd of generals gathered round him, and Count Rostopchín, who<br>had come out from Moscow, joined them. This brilliant company separated<br>into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages<br>of the position, the state of the army, the plans suggested, the<br>situation of Moscow, and military questions generally. Though they had<br>not been summoned for the purpose, and though it was not so called, they<br>all felt that this was really a council of war. The conversations all<br>dealt with public questions. If anyone gave or asked for personal<br>news, it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general<br>matters. No jokes, or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all<br>these men. They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the<br>height the situation demanded. And all these groups, while talking<br>among themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose<br>bench formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might<br>overhear them. The commander in chief listened to what was being said<br>and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, but did not himself<br>take part in the conversations or express any opinion. After hearing<br>what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned<br>away with an air of disappointment, as though they were not speaking of<br>anything he wished to hear. Some discussed the position that had been<br>chosen, criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental<br>capacity of those who had chosen it. Others argued that a mistake had<br>been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days<br>before. Others again spoke of the battle of Salamanca, which was<br>described by Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a Spanish uniform.<br>(This Frenchman and one of the German princes serving with the Russian<br>army were discussing the siege of Saragossa and considering the<br>possibility of defending Moscow in a similar manner.) Count Rostopchín<br>was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city<br>train bands under the walls of the capital, but that he still could not<br>help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening, and<br>that had he known it sooner things would have been different.... A<br>fifth group, displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions,<br>discussed the direction the troops would now have to take. A sixth group<br>was talking absolute nonsense. Kutúzov’s expression grew more and more<br>preoccupied and gloomy. From all this talk he saw only one thing: that<br>to defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of<br>those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any senseless<br>commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would result but the<br>battle would still not take place. It would not take place because the<br>commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible, but<br>in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its<br>inevitable abandonment. How could the commanders lead their troops to<br>a field of battle they considered impossible to hold? The lower-grade<br>officers and even the soldiers (who too reason) also considered the<br>position impossible and therefore could not go to fight, fully convinced<br>as they were of defeat. If Bennigsen insisted on the position being<br>defended and others still discussed it, the question was no longer<br>important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue.<br>This Kutúzov knew well.<br><br>Bennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian<br>patriotism (Kutúzov could not listen to this without wincing) by<br>insisting that Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear as daylight<br>to Kutúzov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on Kutúzov who had<br>brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle; if<br>it succeeded, to claim the success as his own; or if battle were not<br>given, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning Moscow. But this<br>intrigue did not now occupy the old man’s mind. One terrible question<br>absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone. The<br>question for him now was: “Have I really allowed Napoleon to reach<br>Moscow, and when did I do so? When was it decided? Can it have been<br>yesterday when I ordered Plátov to retreat, or was it the evening<br>before, when I had a nap and told Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it<br>earlier still?... When, when was this terrible affair decided? Moscow<br>must be abandoned. The army must retreat and the order to do so must<br>be given.” To give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to<br>resigning the command of the army. And not only did he love power to<br>which he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince Prozoróvski,<br>under whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced<br>that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why, against<br>the Emperor’s wish and by the will of the people, he had been chosen<br>commander in chief. He was convinced that he alone could maintain<br>command of the army in these difficult circumstances, and that in all<br>the world he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear,<br>and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But<br>something had to be decided, and these conversations around him which<br>were assuming too free a character must be stopped.<br><br>He called the most important generals to him.<br><br>“My head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself,” said he, rising<br>from the bench, and he rode to Filí where his carriages were waiting.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>The Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the<br>better and roomier part of Andrew Savostyánov’s hut. The men, women, and<br>children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across<br>the passage. Only Malásha, Andrew’s six-year-old granddaughter whom<br>his Serene Highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar<br>while drinking his tea, remained on the top of the brick oven in the<br>larger room. Malásha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the<br>faces, uniforms, and decorations of the generals, who one after another<br>came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner<br>under the icons. “Granddad” himself, as Malásha in her own mind called<br>Kutúzov, sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven. He sat, sunk deep<br>in a folding armchair, and continually cleared his throat and pulled at<br>the collar of his coat which, though it was unbuttoned, still seemed<br>to pinch his neck. Those who entered went up one by one to the field<br>marshal; he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others. His adjutant<br>Kaysárov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing<br>Kutúzov, but the latter moved his hand angrily and Kaysárov understood<br>that his Serene Highness did not wish his face to be seen.<br><br>Round the peasant’s deal table, on which lay maps, plans, pencils, and<br>papers, so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another<br>bench and put it beside the table. Ermólov, Kaysárov, and Toll, who had<br>just arrived, sat down on this bench. In the foremost place, immediately<br>under the icons, sat Barclay de Tolly, his high forehead merging into<br>his bald crown. He had a St. George’s Cross round his neck and looked<br>pale and ill. He had been feverish for two days and was now shivering<br>and in pain. Beside him sat Uvárov, who with rapid gesticulations was<br>giving him some information, speaking in low tones as they all did.<br>Chubby little Dokhtúrov was listening attentively with eyebrows<br>raised and arms folded on his stomach. On the other side sat Count<br>Ostermann-Tolstóy, seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts. His broad<br>head with its bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand.<br>Raévski, twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his<br>habit, glanced now at Kutúzov and now at the door with a look of<br>impatience. Konovnítsyn’s firm, handsome, and kindly face was lit up by<br>a tender, sly smile. His glance met Malásha’s, and the expression of his<br>eyes caused the little girl to smile.<br><br>They were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of inspecting<br>the position was finishing his savory dinner. They waited for him from<br>four till six o’clock and did not begin their deliberations all that<br>time but talked in low tones of other matters.<br><br>Only when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kutúzov leave his corner and<br>draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that had been<br>placed there to light up his face.<br><br>Bennigsen opened the council with the question: “Are we to abandon<br>Russia’s ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to<br>defend it?” A prolonged and general silence followed. There was a frown<br>on every face and only Kutúzov’s angry grunts and occasional cough<br>broke the silence. All eyes were gazing at him. Malásha too looked at<br>“Granddad.” She was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered; he<br>seemed about to cry, but this did not last long.<br><br>“Russia’s ancient and sacred capital!” he suddenly said, repeating<br>Bennigsen’s words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the<br>false note in them. “Allow me to tell you, your excellency, that that<br>question has no meaning for a Russian.” (He lurched his heavy body<br>forward.) “Such a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The question<br>I have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one.<br>The question is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up Moscow<br>without a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well<br>as Moscow? That is the question on which I want your opinion,” and he<br>sank back in his chair.<br><br>The discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost.<br>Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle at<br>Filí was impossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism and the love<br>of Moscow, he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank<br>during the night and attack the French right flank the following day.<br>Opinions were divided, and arguments were advanced for and against that<br>project. Ermólov, Dokhtúrov, and Raévski agreed with Bennigsen. Whether<br>feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital<br>or guided by other, personal considerations, these generals seemed not<br>to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course<br>of events and that Moscow was in effect already abandoned. The other<br>generals, however, understood it and, leaving aside the question of<br>Moscow, spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat.<br>Malásha, who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her,<br>understood the meaning of the council differently. It seemed to her that<br>it was only a personal struggle between “Granddad” and “Long-coat” as<br>she termed Bennigsen. She saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to<br>one another, and in her heart she sided with “Granddad.” In the midst of<br>the conversation she noticed “Granddad” give Bennigsen a quick, subtle<br>glance, and then to her joys she saw that “Granddad” said something to<br>“Long-coat” which settled him. Bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced<br>angrily up and down the room. What so affected him was Kutúzov’s calm<br>and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsen’s<br>proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to<br>attack the French right wing.<br><br>“Gentlemen,” said Kutúzov, “I cannot approve of the count’s plan. Moving<br>troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous, and military<br>history supports that view. For instance...” Kutúzov seemed to reflect,<br>searching for an example, then with a clear, naïve look at Bennigsen he<br>added: “Oh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the count<br>well remembers, and which was... not fully successful, only because our<br>troops were rearranged too near the enemy....”<br><br>There followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them all.<br><br>The discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they all<br>felt that there was no more to be said.<br><br>During one of these pauses Kutúzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to<br>speak. They all looked at him.<br><br>“Well, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the broken<br>crockery,” said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table. “Gentlemen,<br>I have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with me. But I,” he<br>paused, “by the authority entrusted to me by my Sovereign and country,<br>order a retreat.”<br><br>After that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and<br>circumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.<br><br>Some of the generals, in low tones and in a strain very different from<br>the way they had spoken during the council, communicated something to<br>their commander in chief.<br><br>Malásha, who had long been expected for supper, climbed carefully<br>backwards down from the oven, her bare little feet catching at its<br>projections, and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted<br>out of the room.<br><br>When he had dismissed the generals Kutúzov sat a long time with his<br>elbows on the table, thinking always of the same terrible question:<br>“When, when did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable? When was<br>that done which settled the matter? And who was to blame for it?”<br><br>“I did not expect this,” said he to his adjutant Schneider when the<br>latter came in late that night. “I did not expect this! I did not think<br>this would happen.”<br><br>“You should take some rest, your Serene Highness,” replied Schneider.<br><br>“But no! They shall eat horseflesh yet, like the Turks!” exclaimed<br>Kutúzov without replying, striking the table with his podgy fist. “They<br>shall too, if only...”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>At that very time, in circumstances even more important than retreating<br>without a battle, namely the evacuation and burning of Moscow,<br>Rostopchín, who is usually represented as being the instigator of that<br>event, acted in an altogether different manner from Kutúzov.<br><br>After the battle of Borodinó the abandonment and burning of Moscow was<br>as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow without fighting.<br><br>Every Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but by the<br>feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers.<br><br>The same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all the towns<br>and villages on Russian soil beginning with Smolénsk, without the<br>participation of Count Rostopchín and his broadsheets. The people<br>awaited the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited or tear<br>anyone to pieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the strength to<br>find what it should do at that most difficult moment. And as soon as the<br>enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property,<br>while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left.<br><br>The consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and<br>is present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of this,<br>and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in Russian<br>Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already in July<br>and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who<br>went away, taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half<br>their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses<br>itself not by phrases or by giving one’s children to save the fatherland<br>and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically,<br>and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results.<br><br>“It is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running<br>away from Moscow,” they were told. In his broadsheets Rostopchín<br>impressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed<br>to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing<br>it had to be done. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that<br>Rostopchín had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had<br>committed in conquered countries. The first people to go away were the<br>rich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had<br>remained intact and that during Napoleon’s occupation the inhabitants<br>had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming Frenchmen<br>whom the Russians, and especially the Russian ladies, then liked so<br>much.<br><br>They went away because for Russians there could be no question as to<br>whether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow. It was<br>out of the question to be under French rule, it would be the worst thing<br>that could happen. They went away even before the battle of Borodinó and<br>still more rapidly after it, despite Rostopchín’s calls to defend Moscow<br>or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of<br>the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight, or of the balloons that were<br>to destroy the French, and despite all the nonsense Rostopchín wrote in<br>his broadsheets. They knew that it was for the army to fight, and that<br>if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house<br>serfs to the Three Hills quarter of Moscow to fight Napoleon, and that<br>they must go away, sorry as they were to abandon their property<br>to destruction. They went away without thinking of the tremendous<br>significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to<br>destruction, for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when<br>abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned. They went away each on his<br>own account, and yet it was only in consequence of their going away<br>that the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the<br>greatest glory of the Russian people. The lady who, afraid of being<br>stopped by Count Rostopchín’s orders, had already in June moved with her<br>Negroes and her women jesters from Moscow to her Sarátov estate, with<br>a vague consciousness that she was not Bonaparte’s servant, was really,<br>simply, and truly carrying out the great work which saved Russia. But<br>Count Rostopchín, who now taunted those who left Moscow and now had the<br>government offices removed; now distributed quite useless weapons to<br>the drunken rabble; now had processions displaying the icons, and now<br>forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints; now<br>seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one hundred and thirty-six<br>of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by Leppich; now<br>hinted that he would burn Moscow and related how he had set fire to his<br>own house; now wrote a proclamation to the French solemnly upbraiding<br>them for having destroyed his Orphanage; now claimed the glory of<br>having hinted that he would burn Moscow and now repudiated the deed;<br>now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him, and now<br>reproached them for doing so; now expelled all the French residents from<br>Moscow, and now allowed Madame Aubert-Chalmé (the center of the whole<br>French colony in Moscow) to remain, but ordered the venerable old<br>postmaster Klyucharëv to be arrested and exiled for no particular<br>offense; now assembled the people at the Three Hills to fight the French<br>and now, to get rid of them, handed over to them a man to be killed<br>and himself drove away by a back gate; now declared that he would<br>not survive the fall of Moscow, and now wrote French verses in albums<br>concerning his share in the affair—this man did not understand the<br>meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself<br>that would astonish people, to perform some patriotically heroic<br>feat; and like a child he made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable<br>event—the abandonment and burning of Moscow—and tried with his puny hand<br>now to speed and now to stay the enormous, popular tide that bore him<br>along with it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>Hélène, having returned with the court from Vílna to Petersburg, found<br>herself in a difficult position.<br><br>In Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who<br>occupied one of the highest posts in the Empire. In Vílna she had formed<br>an intimacy with a young foreign prince. When she returned to Petersburg<br>both the magnate and the prince were there, and both claimed their<br>rights. Hélène was faced by a new problem—how to preserve her intimacy<br>with both without offending either.<br><br>What would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did<br>not cause the least embarrassment to Countess Bezúkhova, who evidently<br>deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman. Had she attempted<br>concealment, or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position<br>by cunning, she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself<br>guilty. But Hélène, like a really great man who can do whatever<br>he pleases, at once assumed her own position to be correct, as she<br>sincerely believed it to be, and that everyone else was to blame.<br><br>The first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her, she<br>lifted her beautiful head and, half turning to him, said firmly: “That’s<br>just like a man—selfish and cruel! I expected nothing else. A woman<br>sacrifices herself for you, she suffers, and this is her reward! What<br>right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my attachments and<br>friendships? He is a man who has been more than a father to me!” The<br>prince was about to say something, but Hélène interrupted him.<br><br>“Well, yes,” said she, “it may be that he has other sentiments for me<br>than those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut my door<br>on him. I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with ingratitude!<br>Know, monseigneur, that in all that relates to my intimate feelings I<br>render account only to God and to my conscience,” she concluded, laying<br>her hand on her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and looking up to<br>heaven.<br><br>“But for heaven’s sake listen to me!”<br><br>“Marry me, and I will be your slave!”<br><br>“But that’s impossible.”<br><br>“You won’t deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you...” said Hélène,<br>beginning to cry.<br><br>The prince tried to comfort her, but Hélène, as if quite distraught,<br>said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying,<br>that there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but<br>she mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she had<br>never been her husband’s wife, and that she had been sacrificed.<br><br>“But the law, religion...” said the prince, already yielding.<br><br>“The law, religion... What have they been invented for if they can’t<br>arrange that?” said Hélène.<br><br>The prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him,<br>and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the Society of Jesus,<br>with whom he was on intimate terms.<br><br>A few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which Hélène gave at<br>her country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur de Jobert,<br>a man no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes,<br>a Jesuit à robe courte * was presented to her, and in the garden by the<br>light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a<br>long time of the love of God, of Christ, of the Sacred Heart, and of the<br>consolations the one true Catholic religion affords in this world and<br>the next. Hélène was touched, and more than once tears rose to her eyes<br>and to those of Monsieur de Jobert and their voices trembled. A dance,<br>for which her partner came to seek her, put an end to her discourse with<br>her future directeur de conscience, but the next evening Monsieur de<br>Jobert came to see Hélène when she was alone, and after that often came<br>again.<br><br>    * Lay member of the Society of Jesus.<br><br>One day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she knelt<br>down before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting, middle-aged<br>Frenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself afterward<br>described it, she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her<br>soul. It was explained to her that this was la grâce.<br><br>After that a long-frocked abbé was brought to her. She confessed to<br>him, and he absolved her from her sins. Next day she received a box<br>containing the Sacred Host, which was left at her house for her to<br>partake of. A few days later Hélène learned with pleasure that she had<br>now been admitted to the true Catholic Church and that in a few days the<br>Pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document.<br><br>All that was done around her and to her at this time, all the attention<br>devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant,<br>refined ways, and the state of dove-like purity she was now in (she wore<br>only white dresses and white ribbons all that time) gave her pleasure,<br>but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim. And<br>as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets<br>the better of cleverer ones, Hélène—having realized that the main object<br>of all these words and all this trouble was, after converting her to<br>Catholicism, to obtain money from her for Jesuit institutions (as to<br>which she received indications)—before parting with her money insisted<br>that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband<br>should be performed. In her view the aim of every religion was merely<br>to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to<br>human desires. And with this aim, in one of her talks with her Father<br>Confessor, she insisted on an answer to the question, in how far was she<br>bound by her marriage?<br><br>They were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room.<br>The scent of flowers came in at the window. Hélène was wearing a white<br>dress, transparent over her shoulders and bosom. The abbé, a well-fed<br>man with a plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth, and white<br>hands meekly folded on his knees, sat close to Hélène and, with a<br>subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty,<br>occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the<br>subject. Hélène with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his<br>plump, clean-shaven, blackish cheeks and every moment expected the<br>conversation to take a fresh turn. But the abbé, though he evidently<br>enjoyed the beauty of his companion, was absorbed in his mastery of the<br>matter.<br><br>The course of the Father Confessor’s arguments ran as follows: “Ignorant<br>of the import of what you were undertaking, you made a vow of conjugal<br>fidelity to a man who on his part, by entering the married state without<br>faith in the religious significance of marriage, committed an act of<br>sacrilege. That marriage lacked the dual significance it should have<br>had. Yet in spite of this your vow was binding. You swerved from it.<br>What did you commit by so acting? A venial, or a mortal, sin? A venial<br>sin, for you acted without evil intention. If now you married again<br>with the object of bearing children, your sin might be forgiven. But the<br>question is again a twofold one: firstly...”<br><br>But suddenly Hélène, who was getting bored, said with one of her<br>bewitching smiles: “But I think that having espoused the true religion I<br>cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me.”<br><br>The director of her conscience was astounded at having the case<br>presented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbus’ egg. He was<br>delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupil’s progress, but could<br>not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed.<br><br>“Let us understand one another, Countess,” said he with a smile, and<br>began refuting his spiritual daughter’s arguments.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>Hélène understood that the question was very simple and easy from<br>the ecclesiastical point of view, and that her directors were making<br>difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter<br>would be regarded by the secular authorities.<br><br>So she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society.<br>She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she<br>had told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so that the only<br>way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her. The elderly<br>magnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage<br>with a woman whose husband was alive, as the younger man had been, but<br>Hélène’s imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as<br>marrying a maiden had its effect on him too. Had Hélène herself shown<br>the least sign of hesitation, shame, or secrecy, her cause would<br>certainly have been lost; but not only did she show no signs of secrecy<br>or shame, on the contrary, with good-natured naïveté she told her<br>intimate friends (and these were all Petersburg) that both the prince<br>and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and was<br>afraid of grieving either.<br><br>A rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that Hélène wanted to<br>be divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would have<br>opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the unfortunate and<br>interesting Hélène was in doubt which of the two men she should marry.<br>The question was no longer whether this was possible, but only which was<br>the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court. There<br>were, it is true, some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of<br>such a question, who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament<br>of marriage, but there were not many such and they remained silent,<br>while the majority were interested in Hélène’s good fortune and in the<br>question which match would be the more advantageous. Whether it was<br>right or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not<br>discuss, for that question had evidently been settled by people “wiser<br>than you or me,” as they said, and to doubt the correctness of that<br>decision would be to risk exposing one’s stupidity and incapacity to<br>live in society.<br><br>Only Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova, who had come to Petersburg that<br>summer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express<br>an opinion contrary to the general one. Meeting Hélène at a ball she<br>stopped her in the middle of the room and, amid general silence, said<br>in her gruff voice: “So wives of living men have started marrying<br>again! Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty? You have been<br>forestalled, my dear! It was thought of long ago. It is done in all the<br>brothels,” and with these words Márya Dmítrievna, turning up her wide<br>sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round,<br>moved across the room.<br><br>Though people were afraid of Márya Dmítrievna she was regarded in<br>Petersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only noticed,<br>and repeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had used, supposing<br>the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.<br><br>Prince Vasíli, who of late very often forgot what he had said and<br>repeated one and the same thing a hundred times, remarked to his<br>daughter whenever he chanced to see her:<br><br>“Hélène, I have a word to say to you,” and he would lead her<br>aside, drawing her hand downward. “I have heard of certain projects<br>concerning... you know. Well my dear child, you know how your father’s<br>heart rejoices to know that you... You have suffered so much.... But, my<br>dear child, consult only your own heart. That is all I have to say,” and<br>concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his<br>daughter’s and move away.<br><br>Bilíbin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man,<br>and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as<br>Hélène always has—men friends who can never change into lovers—once gave<br>her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering.<br><br>“Listen, Bilíbin,” said Hélène (she always called friends of that sort<br>by their surnames), and she touched his coat sleeve with her white,<br>beringed fingers. “Tell me, as you would a sister, what I ought to do.<br>Which of the two?”<br><br>Bilíbin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, with a<br>smile on his lips.<br><br>“You are not taking me unawares, you know,” said he. “As a true friend,<br>I have thought and thought again about your affair. You see, if you<br>marry the prince”—he meant the younger man—and he crooked one finger,<br>“you forever lose the chance of marrying the other, and you will<br>displease the court besides. (You know there is some kind of<br>connection.) But if you marry the old count you will make his last days<br>happy, and as widow of the Grand... the prince would no longer be making<br>a mésalliance by marrying you,” and Bilíbin smoothed out his forehead.<br><br>“That’s a true friend!” said Hélène beaming, and again touching<br>Bilíbin’s sleeve. “But I love them, you know, and don’t want to distress<br>either of them. I would give my life for the happiness of them both.”<br><br>Bilíbin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he could<br>help in that difficulty.<br><br>“Une maîtresse-femme! * That’s what is called putting things squarely.<br>She would like to be married to all three at the same time,” thought he.<br><br>    * A masterly woman.<br><br>“But tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?” Bilíbin asked,<br>his reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so<br>naïve a question. “Will he agree?”<br><br>“Oh, he loves me so!” said Hélène, who for some reason imagined that<br>Pierre too loved her. “He will do anything for me.”<br><br>Bilíbin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.<br><br>“Even divorce you?” said he.<br><br>Hélène laughed.<br><br>Among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed<br>marriage was Hélène’s mother, Princess Kurágina. She was continually<br>tormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned<br>a subject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to the<br>idea. She consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of divorce<br>and remarriage during a husband’s lifetime, and the priest told her that<br>it was impossible, and to her delight showed her a text in the Gospel<br>which (as it seemed to him) plainly forbids remarriage while the husband<br>is alive.<br><br>Armed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable, she<br>drove to her daughter’s early one morning so as to find her alone.<br><br>Having listened to her mother’s objections, Hélène smiled blandly and<br>ironically.<br><br>“But it says plainly: ‘Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced...’”<br>said the old princess.<br><br>“Ah, Maman, ne dites pas de bêtises. Vous ne comprenez rien. Dans ma<br>position j’ai des devoirs,” * said Hélène changing from Russian, in<br>which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear,<br>into French which suited it better.<br><br>     * “Oh, Mamma, don’t talk nonsense! You don’t understand<br>     anything. In my position I have obligations.”<br><br><br>“But, my dear....”<br><br>“Oh, Mamma, how is it you don’t understand that the Holy Father, who has<br>the right to grant dispensations...”<br><br>Just then the lady companion who lived with Hélène came in to announce<br>that His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her.<br><br>“Non, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir, que je suis furieuse contre<br>lui, parce qu’il m’a manqué parole.” *<br><br>     * “No, tell him I don’t wish to see him, I am furious with<br>     him for not keeping his word to me.”<br><br><br>“Comtesse, à tout péché miséricorde,” * said a fair-haired young man<br>with a long face and nose, as he entered the room.<br><br>    * “Countess, there is mercy for every sin.”<br><br><br>The old princess rose respectfully and curtsied. The young man who had<br>entered took no notice of her. The princess nodded to her daughter and<br>sidled out of the room.<br><br>“Yes, she is right,” thought the old princess, all her convictions<br>dissipated by the appearance of His Highness. “She is right, but how<br>is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so<br>simple,” she thought as she got into her carriage.<br><br><br>By the beginning of August Hélène’s affairs were clearly defined and<br>she wrote a letter to her husband—who, as she imagined, loved her very<br>much—informing him of her intention to marry N.N. and of her having<br>embraced the one true faith, and asking him to carry out all the<br>formalities necessary for a divorce, which would be explained to him by<br>the bearer of the letter.<br><br>And so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful<br>keeping—Your friend Hélène.<br><br>This letter was brought to Pierre’s house when he was on the field of<br>Borodinó.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>Toward the end of the battle of Borodinó, Pierre, having run down<br>from Raévski’s battery a second time, made his way through a gully to<br>Knyazkóvo with a crowd of soldiers, reached the dressing station, and<br>seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on, still entangled in<br>the crowds of soldiers.<br><br>The one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly<br>from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return<br>to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own<br>bed. He felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he<br>be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt. But such<br>ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found.<br><br>Though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he<br>was going, still on all sides there was what there had been on the field<br>of battle. There were still the same suffering, exhausted, and sometimes<br>strangely indifferent faces, the same blood, the same soldiers’<br>overcoats, the same sounds of firing which, though distant now, still<br>aroused terror, and besides this there were the foul air and the dust.<br><br>Having gone a couple of miles along the Mozháysk road, Pierre sat down<br>by the roadside.<br><br>Dusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away. Pierre lay leaning on<br>his elbow for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved past him in<br>the darkness. He was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying<br>toward him with a terrific whizz, and then he shuddered and sat up. He<br>had no idea how long he had been there. In the middle of the night three<br>soldiers, having brought some firewood, settled down near him and began<br>lighting a fire.<br><br>The soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at Pierre, got the fire to burn<br>and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and<br>put a little dripping. The pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with<br>the smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed. The three soldiers were<br>eating and talking among themselves, taking no notice of him.<br><br>“And who may you be?” one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently<br>meaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: “If you want to eat<br>we’ll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest<br>man.”<br><br>“I, I...” said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social<br>position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and<br>better understood by them. “By rights I am a militia officer, but my men<br>are not here. I came to the battle and have lost them.”<br><br>“There now!” said one of the soldiers.<br><br>Another shook his head.<br><br>“Would you like a little mash?” the first soldier asked, and handed<br>Pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean.<br><br>Pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they called<br>the food in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than any food<br>he had ever tasted. As he sat bending greedily over it, helping himself<br>to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another, his face was lit up by<br>the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence.<br><br>“Where have you to go to? Tell us!” said one of them.<br><br>“To Mozháysk.”<br><br>“You’re a gentleman, aren’t you?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“And what’s your name?”<br><br>“Peter Kirílych.”<br><br>“Well then, Peter Kirílych, come along with us, we’ll take you there.”<br><br>In the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to Mozháysk.<br><br>By the time they got near Mozháysk and began ascending the steep hill<br>into the town, the cocks were already crowing. Pierre went on with the<br>soldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill<br>and that he had already passed it. He would not soon have remembered<br>this, such was his state of forgetfulness, had he not halfway up the<br>hill stumbled upon his groom, who had been to look for him in the<br>town and was returning to the inn. The groom recognized Pierre in the<br>darkness by his white hat.<br><br>“Your excellency!” he said. “Why, we were beginning to despair! How is<br>it you are on foot? And where are you going, please?”<br><br>“Oh, yes!” said Pierre.<br><br>The soldiers stopped.<br><br>“So you’ve found your folk?” said one of them. “Well, good-by, Peter<br>Kirílych—isn’t it?”<br><br>“Good-by, Peter Kirílych!” Pierre heard the other voices repeat.<br><br>“Good-by!” he said and turned with his groom toward the inn.<br><br>“I ought to give them something!” he thought, and felt in his pocket.<br>“No, better not!” said another, inner voice.<br><br>There was not a room to be had at the inn, they were all occupied.<br>Pierre went out into the yard and, covering himself up head and all, lay<br>down in his carriage.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>Scarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself<br>falling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness of reality,<br>he heard the boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud of projectiles, groans<br>and cries, and smelled blood and powder, and a feeling of horror and<br>dread of death seized him. Filled with fright he opened his eyes and<br>lifted his head from under his cloak. All was tranquil in the yard. Only<br>someone’s orderly passed through the gateway, splashing through the mud,<br>and talked to the innkeeper. Above Pierre’s head some pigeons, disturbed<br>by the movement he had made in sitting up, fluttered under the dark roof<br>of the penthouse. The whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful<br>smell of stable yards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see<br>the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses.<br><br>“Thank God, there is no more of that!” he thought, covering up his head<br>again. “Oh, what a terrible thing is fear, and how shamefully I yielded<br>to it! But they... they were steady and calm all the time, to the<br>end...” thought he.<br><br>They, in Pierre’s mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the<br>battery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before<br>the icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood out<br>clearly and sharply from everyone else.<br><br>“To be a soldier, just a soldier!” thought Pierre as he fell asleep,<br>“to enter communal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them what<br>they are. But how cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my<br>outer man? There was a time when I could have done it. I could have run<br>away from my father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been sent to serve<br>as a soldier after the duel with Dólokhov.” And the memory of the dinner<br>at the English Club when he had challenged Dólokhov flashed through<br>Pierre’s mind, and then he remembered his benefactor at Torzhók. And now<br>a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind.<br>It was taking place at the English Club and someone near and dear to him<br>sat at the end of the table. “Yes, that is he! It is my benefactor.<br>But he died!” thought Pierre. “Yes, he died, and I did not know he was<br>alive. How sorry I am that he died, and how glad I am that he is alive<br>again!” On one side of the table sat Anatole, Dólokhov, Nesvítski,<br>Denísov, and others like them (in his dream the category to which these<br>men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of<br>those he termed they), and he heard those people, Anatole and Dólokhov,<br>shouting and singing loudly; yet through their shouting the voice of his<br>benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words<br>was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield, but<br>pleasant and comforting. Pierre did not understand what his benefactor<br>was saying, but he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite<br>distinct in his dream) that he was talking of goodness and the<br>possibility of being what they were. And they with their simple, kind,<br>firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though they were<br>kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him. Wishing to<br>speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at that moment his<br>legs grew cold and bare.<br><br>He felt ashamed, and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak<br>had in fact slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his cloak Pierre<br>opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs, posts, and yard, but<br>now they were all bluish, lit up, and glittering with frost or dew.<br><br>“It is dawn,” thought Pierre. “But that’s not what I want. I want to<br>hear and understand my benefactor’s words.” Again he covered himself up<br>with his cloak, but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there.<br>There were only thoughts clearly expressed in words, thoughts that<br>someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating.<br><br>Afterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that<br>someone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of that<br>day had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been able to think<br>and express his thoughts like that when awake.<br><br>“To endure war is the most difficult subordination of man’s freedom to<br>the law of God,” the voice had said. “Simplicity is submission to the<br>will of God; you cannot escape from Him. And they are simple. They do<br>not talk, but act. The spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden.<br>Man can be master of nothing while he fears death, but he who does not<br>fear it possesses all. If there were no suffering, man would not know<br>his limitations, would not know himself. The hardest thing (Pierre went<br>on thinking, or hearing, in his dream) is to be able in your soul to<br>unite the meaning of all. To unite all?” he asked himself. “No, not<br>to unite. Thoughts cannot be united, but to harness all these thoughts<br>together is what we need! Yes, one must harness them, must harness<br>them!” he repeated to himself with inward rapture, feeling that these<br>words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the<br>question that tormented him.<br><br>“Yes, one must harness, it is time to harness.”<br><br>“Time to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your excellency!”<br>some voice was repeating. “We must harness, it is time to harness....”<br><br>It was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun shone<br>straight into Pierre’s face. He glanced at the dirty innyard in the<br>middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump<br>while carts were passing out of the gate. Pierre turned away with<br>repugnance, and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat.<br>“No, I don’t want that, I don’t want to see and understand that. I want<br>to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream. One second<br>more and I should have understood it all! But what am I to do? Harness,<br>but how can I harness everything?” and Pierre felt with horror that the<br>meaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed.<br><br>The groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that an officer<br>had come with news that the French were already near Mozháysk and that<br>our men were leaving it.<br><br>Pierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake him, went on<br>foot through the town.<br><br>The troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded behind<br>them. There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of the houses, and<br>the streets were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts that<br>were to take some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, and blows could<br>be heard. Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which had overtaken<br>him, to a wounded general he knew, and drove with him to Moscow. On the<br>way Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of<br>that of Prince Andrew.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>On the thirtieth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to the gates of<br>the city he was met by Count Rostopchín’s adjutant.<br><br>“We have been looking for you everywhere,” said the adjutant. “The count<br>wants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at once on a<br>very important matter.”<br><br>Without going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow<br>commander in chief.<br><br>Count Rostopchín had only that morning returned to town from his summer<br>villa at Sokólniki. The anteroom and reception room of his house<br>were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders.<br>Vasílchikov and Plátov had already seen the count and explained to him<br>that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it would have to be<br>surrendered. Though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants,<br>the officials—the heads of the various government departments—knew that<br>Moscow would soon be in the enemy’s hands, just as Count Rostopchín<br>himself knew it, and to escape personal responsibility they had all<br>come to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various<br>departments.<br><br>As Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came<br>out of Rostopchín’s private room.<br><br>In answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier made a<br>despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room.<br><br>While waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched the<br>various officials, old and young, military and civilian, who were there.<br>They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to a group of<br>men, one of whom he knew. After greeting Pierre they continued their<br>conversation.<br><br>“If they’re sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm,<br>but as things are now one can’t answer for anything.”<br><br>“But you see what he writes...” said another, pointing to a printed<br>sheet he held in his hand.<br><br>“That’s another matter. That’s necessary for the people,” said the<br>first.<br><br>“What is it?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“Oh, it’s a fresh broadsheet.”<br><br>Pierre took it and began reading.<br><br>His Serene Highness has passed through Mozháysk in order to join up with<br>the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where<br>the enemy will not soon attack him. Forty-eight guns with ammunition<br>have been sent him from here, and his Serene Highness says he will<br>defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in<br>the streets. Do not be upset, brothers, that the law courts are closed;<br>things have to be put in order, and we will deal with villains in our<br>own way! When the time comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and<br>will raise the cry a day or two beforehand, but they are not wanted yet<br>so I hold my peace. An ax will be useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a<br>three-pronged fork will be best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a<br>sheaf of rye. Tomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of<br>the Mother of God to the wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will<br>have some water blessed. That will help them to get well quicker. I,<br>too, am well now: one of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout<br>with both.<br><br>“But military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the<br>town,” said Pierre, “and that the position...”<br><br>“Well, of course! That’s what we were saying,” replied the first<br>speaker.<br><br>“And what does he mean by ‘One of my eyes was sore but now I am on the<br>lookout with both’?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“The count had a sty,” replied the adjutant smiling, “and was very much<br>upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with<br>him. By the by, Count,” he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a<br>smile, “we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess,<br>your wife...”<br><br>“I have heard nothing,” Pierre replied unconcernedly. “But what have you<br>heard?”<br><br>“Oh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I<br>heard.”<br><br>“But what did you hear?”<br><br>“Well, they say,” continued the adjutant with the same smile, “that<br>the countess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad. I expect it’s<br>nonsense....”<br><br>“Possibly,” remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly. “And who<br>is that?” he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant<br>overcoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face.<br><br>“He? That’s a tradesman, that is to say, he’s the restaurant<br>keeper, Vereshchágin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the<br>proclamation.”<br><br>“Oh, so that is Vereshchágin!” said Pierre, looking at the firm, calm<br>face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor.<br><br>“That’s not he himself, that’s the father of the fellow who wrote the<br>proclamation,” said the adjutant. “The young man is in prison and I<br>expect it will go hard with him.”<br><br>An old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German wearing a<br>cross round his neck, approached the speaker.<br><br>“It’s a complicated story, you know,” said the adjutant. “That<br>proclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed of<br>it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel Ivánovich<br>here made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly<br>sixty-three hands. He asked one, ‘From whom did you get it?’ ‘From<br>so-and-so.’ He went to the next one. ‘From whom did you get it?’ and so<br>on till he reached Vereshchágin, a half educated tradesman, you know, ‘a<br>pet of a trader,’” said the adjutant smiling. “They asked him, ‘Who gave<br>it you?’ And the point is that we knew whom he had it from. He could<br>only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently they had come to<br>some understanding. He replied: ‘From no one; I made it up myself.’<br>They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: ‘I made it<br>up myself.’ And so it was reported to the count, who sent for the man.<br>‘From whom did you get the proclamation?’ ‘I wrote it myself.’ Well, you<br>know the count,” said the adjutant cheerfully, with a smile of pride,<br>“he flared up dreadfully—and just think of the fellow’s audacity, lying,<br>and obstinacy!”<br><br>“And the count wanted him to say it was from Klyucharëv? I understand!”<br>said Pierre.<br><br>“Not at all,” rejoined the adjutant in dismay. “Klyucharëv had his own<br>sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished.<br>But the point is that the count was much annoyed. ‘How could you have<br>written it yourself?’ said he, and he took up the Hamburg Gazette that<br>was lying on the table. ‘Here it is! You did not write it yourself but<br>translated it, and translated it abominably, because you don’t even know<br>French, you fool.’ And what do you think? ‘No,’ said he, ‘I have not<br>read any papers, I made it up myself.’ ‘If that’s so, you’re a traitor<br>and I’ll have you tried, and you’ll be hanged! Say from whom you had<br>it.’ ‘I have seen no papers, I made it up myself.’ And that was the end<br>of it. The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck to it.<br>He was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor, I believe. Now the<br>father has come to intercede for him. But he’s a good-for-nothing lad!<br>You know that sort of tradesman’s son, a dandy and lady-killer. He<br>attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match<br>for him. That’s the sort of fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop<br>here by the Stone Bridge, and you know there was a large icon of God<br>Almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other.<br>Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do?<br>He found some scoundrel of a painter...”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>In the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the commander in<br>chief.<br><br>When he entered the private room Count Rostopchín, puckering his face,<br>was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short man was saying<br>something, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out.<br><br>“Ah, how do you do, great warrior?” said Rostopchín as soon as the short<br>man had left the room. “We have heard of your prowess. But that’s not<br>the point. Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?” he<br>went on severely, as though there were something wrong about it which<br>he nevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre remained silent. “I am well<br>informed, my friend, but I am aware that there are Masons and I hope<br>that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to<br>ruin Russia.”<br><br>“Yes, I am a Mason,” Pierre replied.<br><br>“There, you see, mon cher! I expect you know that Messrs. Speránski and<br>Magnítski have been deported to their proper place. Mr. Klyucharëv has<br>been treated in the same way, and so have others who on the plea of<br>building up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple of<br>their fatherland. You can understand that there are reasons for this and<br>that I could not have exiled the Postmaster had he not been a harmful<br>person. It has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage<br>for his removal from town, and that you have even accepted papers from<br>him for safe custody. I like you and don’t wish you any harm and—as<br>you are only half my age—I advise you, as a father would, to cease<br>all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as<br>possible.”<br><br>“But what did Klyucharëv do wrong, Count?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“That is for me to know, but not for you to ask,” shouted Rostopchín.<br><br>“If he is accused of circulating Napoleon’s proclamation it is not<br>proved that he did so,” said Pierre without looking at Rostopchín, “and<br>Vereshchágin...”<br><br>“There we are!” Rostopchín shouted at Pierre louder than before,<br>frowning suddenly. “Vereshchágin is a renegade and a traitor who will<br>be punished as he deserves,” said he with the vindictive heat with which<br>people speak when recalling an insult. “But I did not summon you to<br>discuss my actions, but to give you advice—or an order if you prefer it.<br>I beg you to leave the town and break off all communication with such<br>men as Klyucharëv. And I will knock the nonsense out of anybody”—but<br>probably realizing that he was shouting at Bezúkhov who so far was not<br>guilty of anything, he added, taking Pierre’s hand in a friendly manner,<br>“We are on the eve of a public disaster and I haven’t time to be polite<br>to everybody who has business with me. My head is sometimes in a whirl.<br>Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?”<br><br>“Why, nothing,” answered Pierre without raising his eyes or changing the<br>thoughtful expression of his face.<br><br>The count frowned.<br><br>“A word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off as soon as you can, that’s<br>all I have to tell you. Happy he who has ears to hear. Good-by, my dear<br>fellow. Oh, by the by!” he shouted through the doorway after Pierre,<br>“is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy<br>fathers of the Society of Jesus?”<br><br>Pierre did not answer and left Rostopchín’s room more sullen and angry<br>than he had ever before shown himself.<br><br>When he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight people had<br>come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee, the colonel<br>of his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various petitioners.<br>They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him. Pierre<br>did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and<br>only answered them in order to get rid of these people. When left alone<br>at last he opened and read his wife’s letter.<br><br>“They, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... that old<br>man... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffering is necessary... the<br>meaning of all... one must harness... my wife is getting married... One<br>must forget and understand...” And going to his bed he threw himself on<br>it without undressing and immediately fell asleep.<br><br>When he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that a<br>special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count Rostopchín to<br>know whether Count Bezúkhov had left or was leaving the town.<br><br>A dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in the<br>drawing room. Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going to see<br>them, went to the back porch and out through the gate.<br><br>From that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of<br>Bezúkhov’s household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre again<br>or knew where he was.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>The Rostóvs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is,<br>till the eve of the enemy’s entry into the city.<br><br>After Pétya had joined Obolénski’s regiment of Cossacks and left for<br>Bélaya Tsérkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was seized<br>with terror. The thought that both her sons were at the war, had both<br>gone from under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or both of them<br>might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances, struck<br>her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness. She tried to<br>get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to join Pétya, or to get<br>him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved<br>possible. Pétya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless<br>he was transferred to another regiment on active service. Nicholas was<br>somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter,<br>in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with Princess<br>Mary. The countess did not sleep at night, or when she did fall asleep<br>dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead. After many consultations and<br>conversations, the count at last devised means to tranquillize her. He<br>got Pétya transferred from Obolénski’s regiment to Bezúkhov’s, which was<br>in training near Moscow. Though Pétya would remain in the service, this<br>transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one<br>of her sons under her wing, and she hoped to arrange matters for her<br>Pétya so as not to let him go again, but always get him appointed to<br>places where he could not possibly take part in a battle. As long as<br>Nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her<br>first-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself<br>for it; but when her youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad at<br>lessons, was always breaking things in the house and making himself a<br>nuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed Pétya with his merry black eyes<br>and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show—when<br>he was thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting<br>somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it—then<br>his mother thought she loved him more, much more, than all her other<br>children. The nearer the time came for Pétya to return, the more uneasy<br>grew the countess. She began to think she would never live to see such<br>happiness. The presence of Sónya, of her beloved Natásha, or even of<br>her husband irritated her. “What do I want with them? I want no one but<br>Pétya,” she thought.<br><br>At the end of August the Rostóvs received another letter from Nicholas.<br>He wrote from the province of Vorónezh where he had been sent to procure<br>remounts, but that letter did not set the countess at ease. Knowing that<br>one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about Pétya.<br><br>Though by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rostóvs’ acquaintances<br>had left Moscow, and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to<br>get away as quickly as possible, she would not hear of leaving before<br>her treasure, her adored Pétya, returned. On the twenty-eighth of August<br>he arrived. The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him<br>did not please the sixteen-year-old officer. Though she concealed from<br>him her intention of keeping him under her wing, Pétya guessed her<br>designs, and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion<br>when with her—might “become womanish” as he termed it to himself—he<br>treated her coldly, avoided her, and during his stay in Moscow attached<br>himself exclusively to Natásha for whom he had always had a particularly<br>brotherly tenderness, almost lover-like.<br><br>Owing to the count’s customary carelessness nothing was ready for their<br>departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to<br>come from their Ryazán and Moscow estates to remove their household<br>belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth.<br><br>From the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle<br>and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodinó were<br>brought in by the Dorogomílov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow,<br>and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions<br>out by the other gates. In spite of Rostopchín’s broadsheets, or because<br>of them or independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory<br>rumors were current in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed<br>to leave the city, others on the contrary said that all the icons had<br>been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave.<br>Some said there had been another battle after Borodinó at which the<br>French had been routed, while others on the contrary reported that the<br>Russian army had been destroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia<br>which, preceded by the clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others<br>whispered that Augustin had been forbidden to leave, that traitors had<br>been seized, that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their<br>way from Moscow, and so on. But all this was only talk; in reality<br>(though the Council of Filí, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow,<br>had not yet been held) both those who went away and those who remained<br>behind felt, though they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly<br>be abandoned, and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and<br>save their belongings. It was felt that everything would suddenly break<br>up and change, but up to the first of September nothing had done so.<br>As a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die<br>immediately, but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is<br>awry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life,<br>though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the<br>conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would<br>be completely upset.<br><br>During the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole<br>Rostóv family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the<br>family, Count Ilyá Rostóv, continually drove about the city collecting<br>the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders<br>at home about the preparations for their departure.<br><br>The countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied with<br>everything, was constantly in pursuit of Pétya who was always running<br>away from her, and was jealous of Natásha with whom he spent all his<br>time. Sónya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting<br>things packed. But of late Sónya had been particularly sad and silent.<br>Nicholas’ letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had elicited, in<br>her presence, joyous comments from the countess, who saw an intervention<br>of Providence in this meeting of the princess and Nicholas.<br><br>“I was never pleased at Bolkónski’s engagement to Natásha,” said the<br>countess, “but I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had a<br>presentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!”<br><br>Sónya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of retrieving<br>the Rostóvs’ affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman, and that the<br>princess was a good match. It was very bitter for her. But despite<br>her grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on herself all the<br>difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and<br>was busy for whole days. The count and countess turned to her when they<br>had any orders to give. Pétya and Natásha on the contrary, far from<br>helping their parents, were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to<br>everyone. Almost all day long the house resounded with their running<br>feet, their cries, and their spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were<br>gay not because there was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and<br>mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause<br>for gaiety and laughter to them. Pétya was in high spirits because<br>having left home a boy he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine<br>young man, because he was at home, because he had left Bélaya Tsérkov<br>where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to<br>Moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because<br>Natásha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. Natásha was<br>gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of<br>the cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was also<br>happy because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of others was<br>a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freely—and<br>Pétya adored her. Above all, they were gay because there was a war near<br>Moscow, there would be fighting at the town gates, arms were being<br>given out, everybody was escaping—going away somewhere, and in general<br>something extraordinary was happening, and that is always exciting,<br>especially to the young.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>On Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the Rostóvs’<br>house seemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all the furniture was<br>being carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and pictures had been<br>taken down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay, wrapping paper, and<br>ropes were scattered about. The peasants and house serfs carrying out<br>the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors. The yard was<br>crowded with peasant carts, some loaded high and already corded up,<br>others still empty.<br><br>The voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who<br>had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in<br>the yard and in the house. The count had been out since morning. The<br>countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was<br>lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head.<br>Pétya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant<br>to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army. Sónya was in<br>the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china. Natásha<br>was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses, ribbons,<br>and scarves strewn all about her, gazing fixedly at the floor and<br>holding in her hands the old ball dress (already out of fashion) which<br>she had worn at her first Petersburg ball.<br><br>Natásha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy, and<br>several times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart was<br>not in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything except<br>with all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood beside<br>Sónya while the china was being packed and tried to help, but soon gave<br>it up and went to her room to pack her own things. At first she found it<br>amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids, but when that was<br>done and what was left had still to be packed, she found it dull.<br><br>“Dunyásha, you pack! You will, won’t you, dear?” And when Dunyásha<br>willingly promised to do it all for her, Natásha sat down on the floor,<br>took her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what<br>ought to have occupied her thoughts now. She was roused from her reverie<br>by the talk of the maids in the next room (which was theirs) and by the<br>sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch. Natásha got<br>up and looked out of the window. An enormously long row of carts full of<br>wounded men had stopped in the street.<br><br>The housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen,<br>postilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.<br><br>Natásha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding<br>an end of it in each hand, went out into the street.<br><br>The former housekeeper, old Mávra Kuzmínichna, had stepped out of the<br>crowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast<br>mats, and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside.<br>Natásha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her<br>handkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.<br><br>“Then you have nobody in Moscow?” she was saying. “You would be more<br>comfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the family<br>are leaving.”<br><br>“I don’t know if it would be allowed,” replied the officer in a weak<br>voice. “Here is our commanding officer... ask him,” and he pointed to a<br>stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts.<br><br>Natásha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer<br>and at once went to meet the major.<br><br>“May the wounded men stay in our house?” she asked.<br><br>The major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.<br><br>“Which one do you want, Ma’am’selle?” said he, screwing up his eyes and<br>smiling.<br><br>Natásha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole<br>manner were so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her<br>handkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection—as<br>if considering in how far the thing was possible—replied in the<br>affirmative.<br><br>“Oh yes, why not? They may,” he said.<br><br>With a slight inclination of her head, Natásha stepped back quickly to<br>Mávra Kuzmínichna, who stood talking compassionately to the officer.<br><br>“They may. He says they may!” whispered Natásha.<br><br>The cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rostóvs’ yard,<br>and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the<br>townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the<br>houses in Povarskáya Street. Natásha was evidently pleased to be dealing<br>with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life. She and Mávra<br>Kuzmínichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their<br>yard.<br><br>“Your Papa must be told, though,” said Mávra Kuzmínichna.<br><br>“Never mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can move<br>into the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house.”<br><br>“There now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if we<br>put them into the wing, the men’s room, or the nurse’s room, we must ask<br>permission.”<br><br>“Well, I’ll ask.”<br><br>Natásha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door<br>into the sitting room, where there was a smell of vinegar and Hoffman’s<br>drops.<br><br>“Are you asleep, Mamma?”<br><br>“Oh, what sleep—?” said the countess, waking up just as she was dropping<br>into a doze.<br><br>“Mamma darling!” said Natásha, kneeling by her mother and bringing her<br>face close to her mother’s, “I am sorry, forgive me, I’ll never do it<br>again; I woke you up! Mávra Kuzmínichna has sent me: they have brought<br>some wounded here—officers. Will you let them come? They have nowhere to<br>go. I knew you’d let them come!” she said quickly all in one breath.<br><br>“What officers? Whom have they brought? I don’t understand anything<br>about it,” said the countess.<br><br>Natásha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.<br><br>“I knew you’d give permission... so I’ll tell them,” and, having kissed<br>her mother, Natásha got up and went to the door.<br><br>In the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.<br><br>“We’ve stayed too long!” said the count with involuntary vexation. “The<br>Club is closed and the police are leaving.”<br><br>“Papa, is it all right—I’ve invited some of the wounded into the house?”<br>said Natásha.<br><br>“Of course it is,” he answered absently. “That’s not the point. I beg<br>you not to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and tomorrow we<br>must go, go, go!...”<br><br>And the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the servants.<br><br>At dinner Pétya having returned home told them the news he had heard.<br>He said the people had been getting arms in the Krémlin, and that though<br>Rostopchín’s broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three<br>days in advance, the order had certainly already been given for everyone<br>to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and that there would be a big<br>battle there.<br><br>The countess looked with timid horror at her son’s eager, excited face<br>as he said this. She realized that if she said a word about his not<br>going to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending<br>engagement) he would say something about men, honor, and the<br>fatherland—something senseless, masculine, and obstinate which there<br>would be no contradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; and so,<br>hoping to arrange to leave before then and take Pétya with her as their<br>protector and defender, she did not answer him, but after dinner called<br>the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly,<br>that very night if possible. With a woman’s involuntary loving cunning<br>she, who till then had not shown any alarm, said that she would die of<br>fright if they did not leave that very night. Without any pretense she<br>was now afraid of everything.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>Madame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the<br>countess’ fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit<br>dealer’s in Myasnítski Street. When returning by that street she had<br>been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of<br>the shop. She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the<br>cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at<br>the drink store, having received orders to do so.<br><br>After dinner the whole Rostóv household set to work with enthusiastic<br>haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure. The<br>old count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing from the yard to the<br>house and back again, shouting confused instructions to the hurrying<br>people, and flurrying them still more. Pétya directed things in the<br>yard. Sónya, owing to the count’s contradictory orders, lost her head<br>and did not know what to do. The servants ran noisily about the house<br>and yard, shouting and disputing. Natásha, with the ardor characteristic<br>of all she did suddenly set to work too. At first her intervention in<br>the business of packing was received skeptically. Everybody expected<br>some prank from her and did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely<br>and passionately demanded obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because<br>they did not heed her, and at last succeeded in making them believe her.<br>Her first exploit, which cost her immense effort and established her<br>authority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had valuable<br>Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When Natásha set<br>to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost full<br>up with crockery, the other with carpets. There was also much china<br>standing on the tables, and still more was being brought in from the<br>storeroom. A third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it.<br><br>“Sónya, wait a bit—we’ll pack everything into these,” said Natásha.<br><br>“You can’t, Miss, we have tried to,” said the butler’s assistant.<br><br>“No, wait a minute, please.”<br><br>And Natásha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates<br>wrapped in paper.<br><br>“The dishes must go in here among the carpets,” said she.<br><br>“Why, it’s a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases,”<br>said the butler’s assistant.<br><br>“Oh, wait, please!” And Natásha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the<br>things. “These aren’t needed,” said she, putting aside some plates<br>of Kiev ware. “These—yes, these must go among the carpets,” she said,<br>referring to the Saxony china dishes.<br><br>“Don’t, Natásha! Leave it alone! We’ll get it all packed,” urged Sónya<br>reproachfully.<br><br>“What a young lady she is!” remarked the major-domo.<br><br>But Natásha would not give in. She turned everything out and began<br>quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and<br>unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had<br>been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned<br>out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been<br>rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases. Only<br>the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A few<br>more things might have been taken out, but Natásha insisted on having<br>her own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butler’s assistant<br>and Pétya—whom she had drawn into the business of packing—press on the<br>lid, and made desperate efforts herself.<br><br>“That’s enough, Natásha,” said Sónya. “I see you were right, but just<br>take out the top one.”<br><br>“I won’t!” cried Natásha, with one hand holding back the hair that hung<br>over her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down the<br>carpets. “Now press, Pétya! Press, Vasílich, press hard!” she cried.<br><br>The carpets yielded and the lid closed; Natásha, clapping her hands,<br>screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only<br>lasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her<br>completely. The count was not angry even when they told him that Natásha<br>had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came to her<br>to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it might<br>be corded up. Thanks to Natásha’s directions the work now went on<br>expeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most valuable<br>packed as compactly as possible.<br><br>But hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could not<br>get everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the count,<br>having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.<br><br>Sónya and Natásha slept in the sitting room without undressing.<br><br>That night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskáya, and Mávra<br>Kuzmínichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into the<br>Rostóvs’ yard. Mávra Kuzmínichna concluded that he was a very important<br>man. He was being conveyed in a calèche with a raised hood, and was<br>quite covered by an apron. On the box beside the driver sat a venerable<br>old attendant. A doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a<br>cart.<br><br>“Please come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house<br>will be empty,” said the old woman to the old attendant.<br><br>“Well, perhaps,” said he with a sigh. “We don’t expect to get him home<br>alive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but it’s a long way from<br>here, and there’s nobody living in it.”<br><br>“Do us the honor to come in, there’s plenty of everything in the<br>master’s house. Come in,” said Mávra Kuzmínichna. “Is he very ill?” she<br>asked.<br><br>The attendant made a hopeless gesture.<br><br>“We don’t expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor.”<br><br>And the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.<br><br>“All right!” said the doctor.<br><br>The old servant returned to the calèche, looked into it, shook his<br>head disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and stopped<br>beside Mávra Kuzmínichna.<br><br>“O, Lord Jesus Christ!” she murmured.<br><br>She invited them to take the wounded man into the house.<br><br>“The masters won’t object...” she said.<br><br>But they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took him<br>into the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame Schoss’.<br><br>This wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolkónski.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>Moscow’s last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday.<br>The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just as usual on<br>Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.<br><br>Only two things indicated the social condition of Moscow—the rabble,<br>that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An enormous crowd<br>of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with whom some officials,<br>seminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone early that morning to<br>the Three Hills. Having waited there for Rostopchín who did not turn<br>up, they became convinced that Moscow would be surrendered, and then<br>dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops. Prices<br>too that day indicated the state of affairs. The price of weapons, of<br>gold, of carts and horses, kept rising, but the value of paper money and<br>city articles kept falling, so that by midday there were instances of<br>carters removing valuable goods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment<br>a half of what they carted, while peasant horses were fetching five<br>hundred rubles each, and furniture, mirrors, and bronzes were being<br>given away for nothing.<br><br>In the Rostóvs’ staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of former<br>conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs the only<br>indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared<br>during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their<br>possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their<br>estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and<br>they were offered enormous sums of money for them. Not only were huge<br>sums offered for the horses and carts, but on the previous evening and<br>early in the morning of the first of September, orderlies and servants<br>sent by wounded officers came to the Rostóvs’ and wounded men dragged<br>themselves there from the Rostóvs’ and from neighboring houses where<br>they were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to get them<br>a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo to whom these entreaties were<br>addressed, though he was sorry for the wounded, resolutely refused,<br>saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count. Pity these<br>wounded men as one might, it was evident that if they were given one<br>cart there would be no reason to refuse another, or all the carts and<br>one’s own carriages as well. Thirty carts could not save all the wounded<br>and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one’s<br>own family. So thought the major-domo on his master’s behalf.<br><br>On waking up that morning Count Ilyá Rostóv left his bedroom softly, so<br>as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning,<br>and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In the yard<br>stood the carts ready corded. The carriages were at the front porch.<br>The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to<br>a pale young officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing the count the<br>major-domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away.<br><br>“Well, Vasílich, is everything ready?” asked the count, and stroking his<br>bald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the orderly and<br>nodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)<br><br>“We can harness at once, your excellency.”<br><br>“Well, that’s right. As soon as the countess wakes we’ll be off, God<br>willing! What is it, gentlemen?” he added, turning to the officer. “Are<br>you staying in my house?”<br><br>The officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.<br><br>“Count, be so good as to allow me... for God’s sake, to get into some<br>corner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I shall be<br>all right on a loaded cart....”<br><br>Before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same<br>request on behalf of his master.<br><br>“Oh, yes, yes, yes!” said the count hastily. “I shall be very pleased,<br>very pleased. Vasílich, you’ll see to it. Just unload one or two carts.<br>Well, what of it... do what’s necessary...” said the count, muttering<br>some indefinite order.<br><br>But at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officer’s<br>face had already sealed the order. The count looked around him. In the<br>yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded officers and<br>their orderlies were to be seen. They were all looking at the count and<br>moving toward the porch.<br><br>“Please step into the gallery, your excellency,” said the major-domo.<br>“What are your orders about the pictures?”<br><br>The count went into the house with him, repeating his order not to<br>refuse the wounded who asked for a lift.<br><br>“Well, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded,” he added in a<br>soft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being overheard.<br><br>At nine o’clock the countess woke up, and Matrëna Timoféevna, who had<br>been her lady’s maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of<br>chief gendarme’s duty for her, came to say that Madame Schoss was much<br>offended and the young ladies’ summer dresses could not be left behind.<br>On inquiry, the countess learned that Madame Schoss was offended because<br>her trunk had been taken down from its cart, and all the loads were<br>being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for<br>wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered<br>that they should take with them. The countess sent for her husband.<br><br>“What is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded.”<br><br>“You know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer<br>came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are<br>things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to<br>them!... Really now, in our own yard—we asked them in ourselves and<br>there are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let them<br>be taken... where’s the hurry?”<br><br>The count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money matters.<br>The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of<br>something detrimental to the children’s interests, such as the building<br>of a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a private theater<br>or an orchestra. She was accustomed always to oppose anything announced<br>in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so.<br><br>She assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband:<br>“Listen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are getting<br>nothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all our—all the<br>children’s property! You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand<br>rubles’ worth of things in the house. I don’t consent, my dear, I don’t!<br>Do as you please! It’s the government’s business to look after the<br>wounded; they know that. Look at the Lopukhíns opposite, they cleared<br>out everything two days ago. That’s what other people do. It’s only<br>we who are such fools. If you have no pity on me, have some for the<br>children.”<br><br>Flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without<br>replying.<br><br>“Papa, what are you doing that for?” asked Natásha, who had followed him<br>into her mother’s room.<br><br>“Nothing! What business is it of yours?” muttered the count angrily.<br><br>“But I heard,” said Natásha. “Why does Mamma object?”<br><br>“What business is it of yours?” cried the count.<br><br>Natásha stepped up to the window and pondered.<br><br>“Papa! Here’s Berg coming to see us,” said she, looking out of the<br>window.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>Berg, the Rostóvs’ son-in-law, was already a colonel wearing the orders<br>of Vladímir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post<br>of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the<br>first division of the Second Army.<br><br>On the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.<br><br>He had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone in the<br>army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there.<br>So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and<br>domestic reasons.<br><br>Berg drove up to his father-in-law’s house in his spruce little trap<br>with a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He<br>looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the<br>porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.<br><br>From the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the<br>drawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of Natásha<br>and Sónya, and hastened to inquire after “Mamma’s” health.<br><br>“Health, at a time like this?” said the count. “Come, tell us the news!<br>Is the army retreating or will there be another battle?”<br><br>“God Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland, Papa,” said<br>Berg. “The army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders, so<br>to say, have now assembled in council. No one knows what is coming. But<br>in general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic spirit, the truly<br>antique valor of the Russian army, which they—which it” (he corrected<br>himself) “has shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty-sixth—there<br>are no words worthy to do it justice! I tell you, Papa” (he smote<br>himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done, but<br>Berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the<br>words “Russian army”), “I tell you frankly that we, the commanders, far<br>from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind, could hardly<br>restrain those... those... yes, those exploits of antique valor,” he<br>went on rapidly. “General Barclay de Tolly risked his life everywhere at<br>the head of the troops, I can assure you. Our corps was stationed on a<br>hillside. You can imagine!”<br><br>And Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had<br>heard those days. Natásha watched him with an intent gaze that confused<br>him, as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some<br>question.<br><br>“Altogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors<br>cannot be imagined or adequately praised!” said Berg, glancing round<br>at Natásha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her intent<br>look with a smile. “‘Russia is not in Moscow, she lives in the hearts of<br>her sons!’ Isn’t it so, Papa?” said he.<br><br>Just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and<br>dissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her hand,<br>asked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to side to<br>express sympathy, remained standing beside her.<br><br>“Yes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for<br>every Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still time to get<br>away....”<br><br>“I can’t think what the servants are about,” said the countess, turning<br>to her husband. “I have just been told that nothing is ready yet.<br>Somebody after all must see to things. One misses Mítenka at such times.<br>There won’t be any end to it.”<br><br>The count was about to say something, but evidently restrained himself.<br>He got up from his chair and went to the door.<br><br>At that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose<br>and, seeing the knot in it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and<br>significantly.<br><br>“And I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa,” said he.<br><br>“Hm...” said the count, and stopped.<br><br>“I was driving past Yusúpov’s house just now,” said Berg with a laugh,<br>“when the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I wouldn’t<br>buy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and there is a<br>small chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear Véra wanted a<br>chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it.” (At the mention<br>of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone<br>to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements.) “And it’s<br>such a beauty! It pulls out and has a secret English drawer, you know!<br>And dear Véra has long wanted one. I wish to give her a surprise, you<br>see. I saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard. Please let me<br>have one, I will pay the man well, and...”<br><br>The count frowned and coughed.<br><br>“Ask the countess, I don’t give orders.”<br><br>“If it’s inconvenient, please don’t,” said Berg. “Only I so wanted it,<br>for dear Véra’s sake.”<br><br>“Oh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, the devil, the devil...”<br>cried the old count. “My head’s in a whirl!”<br><br>And he left the room. The countess began to cry.<br><br>“Yes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times!” said Berg.<br><br>Natásha left the room with her father and, as if finding it difficult to<br>reach some decision, first followed him and then ran downstairs.<br><br>Pétya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the servants<br>who were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still standing in the<br>yard. Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing<br>into one of them helped by an orderly.<br><br>“Do you know what it’s about?” Pétya asked Natásha.<br><br>She understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about.<br>She did not answer.<br><br>“It’s because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded,” said<br>Pétya. “Vasílich told me. I consider...”<br><br>“I consider,” Natásha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry face to<br>Pétya, “I consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I don’t know what.<br>Are we despicable Germans?”<br><br>Her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and<br>letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed<br>headlong up the stairs.<br><br>Berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful<br>attention of a relative. The count, pipe in hand, was pacing up and down<br>the room, when Natásha, her face distorted by anger, burst in like a<br>tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps.<br><br>“It’s horrid! It’s abominable!” she screamed. “You can’t possibly have<br>ordered it!”<br><br>Berg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The count<br>stood still at the window and listened.<br><br>“Mamma, it’s impossible: see what is going on in the yard!” she cried.<br>“They will be left!...”<br><br>“What’s the matter with you? Who are ‘they’? What do you want?”<br><br>“Why, the wounded! It’s impossible, Mamma. It’s monstrous!... No, Mamma<br>darling, it’s not the thing. Please forgive me, darling.... Mamma, what<br>does it matter what we take away? Only look what is going on in the<br>yard... Mamma!... It’s impossible!”<br><br>The count stood by the window and listened without turning round.<br>Suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.<br><br>The countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for her<br>mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did not turn<br>to look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.<br><br>“Oh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?” she said, not surrendering<br>at once.<br><br>“Mamma, darling, forgive me!”<br><br>But the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband.<br><br>“My dear, you order what is right.... You know I don’t understand about<br>it,” said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.<br><br>“The eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,” muttered the count through<br>tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of<br>shame on his breast.<br><br>“Papa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...” asked Natásha. “We will still<br>take all the most necessary things.”<br><br>The count nodded affirmatively, and Natásha, at the rapid pace at which<br>she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to the<br>anteroom and downstairs into the yard.<br><br>The servants gathered round Natásha, but could not believe the strange<br>order she brought them until the count himself, in his wife’s name,<br>confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the<br>trunks to the storerooms. When they understood that order the servants<br>set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed<br>strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could<br>be done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange<br>to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted<br>away but that had seemed the only thing to do.<br><br>The whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set<br>eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The<br>wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but<br>happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread<br>to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the<br>Rostóvs’ yard. Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts<br>but only to let them sit on the top of the things. But the work of<br>unloading, once started, could not be arrested. It seemed not to matter<br>whether all or only half the things were left behind. Cases full of<br>china, bronzes, pictures, and mirrors that had been so carefully<br>packed the night before now lay about the yard, and still they went on<br>searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and<br>letting the wounded have another and yet another cart.<br><br>“We can take four more men,” said the steward. “They can have my trap,<br>or else what is to become of them?”<br><br>“Let them have my wardrobe cart,” said the countess. “Dunyásha can go<br>with me in the carriage.”<br><br>They unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a<br>house two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was bright<br>and animated. Natásha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she<br>had not known for a long time.<br><br>“What could we fasten this onto?” asked the servants, trying to fix a<br>trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. “We must keep at least<br>one cart.”<br><br>“What’s in it?” asked Natásha.<br><br>“The count’s books.”<br><br>“Leave it, Vasílich will put it away. It’s not wanted.”<br><br>The phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where Count<br>Peter could sit.<br><br>“On the box. You’ll sit on the box, won’t you, Pétya?” cried Natásha.<br><br>Sónya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was quite<br>different from Natásha’s. She was putting away the things that had to<br>be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished, and she<br>tried to get as much taken away with them as possible.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVII<br><br>Before two o’clock in the afternoon the Rostóvs’ four carriages, packed<br>full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door. One by one<br>the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard.<br><br>The calèche in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted Sónya’s<br>attention as it passed the front porch. With the help of a maid she was<br>arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at<br>the entrance.<br><br>“Whose calèche is that?” she inquired, leaning out of the carriage<br>window.<br><br>“Why, didn’t you know, Miss?” replied the maid. “The wounded prince: he<br>spent the night in our house and is going with us.”<br><br>“But who is it? What’s his name?”<br><br>“It’s our intended that was—Prince Bolkónski himself! They say he is<br>dying,” replied the maid with a sigh.<br><br>Sónya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess,<br>tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey,<br>was pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to<br>assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting.<br>Natásha was not in the room.<br><br>“Mamma,” said Sónya, “Prince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is<br>going with us.”<br><br>The countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing Sónya’s arm, glanced<br>around.<br><br>“Natásha?” she murmured.<br><br>At that moment this news had only one significance for both of them.<br>They knew their Natásha, and alarm as to what would happen if she heard<br>this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.<br><br>“Natásha does not know yet, but he is going with us,” said Sónya.<br><br>“You say he is dying?”<br><br>Sónya nodded.<br><br>The countess put her arms around Sónya and began to cry.<br><br>“The ways of God are past finding out!” she thought, feeling that the<br>Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all that was<br>now taking place.<br><br>“Well, Mamma? Everything is ready. What’s the matter?” asked Natásha, as<br>with animated face she ran into the room.<br><br>“Nothing,” answered the countess. “If everything is ready let us start.”<br><br>And the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face. Sónya<br>embraced Natásha and kissed her.<br><br>Natásha looked at her inquiringly.<br><br>“What is it? What has happened?”<br><br>“Nothing... No...”<br><br>“Is it something very bad for me? What is it?” persisted Natásha with<br>her quick intuition.<br><br>Sónya sighed and made no reply. The count, Pétya, Madame Schoss, Mávra<br>Kuzmínichna, and Vasílich came into the drawing room and, having closed<br>the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments silently<br>seated without looking at one another.<br><br>The count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed himself<br>before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count embraced<br>Mávra Kuzmínichna and Vasílich, who were to remain in Moscow, and while<br>they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs<br>lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words. The<br>countess went into the oratory and there Sónya found her on her knees<br>before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall.<br>(The most precious ones, with which some family tradition was connected,<br>were being taken with them.)<br><br>In the porch and in the yard the men whom Pétya had armed with swords<br>and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts<br>and girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining behind.<br><br>As is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put in<br>the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on<br>each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the<br>countess in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house<br>to the carriages, the calèche, the phaeton, and back again.<br><br>“They always will forget everything!” said the countess. “Don’t you know<br>I can’t sit like that?”<br><br>And Dunyásha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an<br>aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange the<br>seat.<br><br>“Oh, those servants!” said the count, swaying his head.<br><br>Efím, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to<br>drive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance<br>round at what was going on behind him. From thirty years’ experience<br>he knew it would be some time yet before the order, “Be off, in God’s<br>name!” would be given him: and he knew that even when it was said<br>he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch<br>something that had been forgotten, and even after that he would again<br>be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg<br>him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill. He knew<br>all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen, with more<br>patience than the horses, especially the near one, the chestnut Falcon,<br>who was pawing the ground and champing his bit. At last all were<br>seated, the carriage steps were folded and pulled up, the door was shut,<br>somebody was sent for a traveling case, and the countess leaned out<br>and said what she had to say. Then Efím deliberately doffed his hat and<br>began crossing himself. The postilion and all the other servants did the<br>same. “Off, in God’s name!” said Efím, putting on his hat. “Start!” The<br>postilion started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar,<br>the high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman<br>sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out<br>of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted in<br>their turn, and the procession of carriages moved up the street. In the<br>carriages, the calèche, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as they<br>passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to remain in Moscow<br>walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.<br><br>Rarely had Natásha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting in<br>the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding<br>walls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned out of the<br>carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of<br>wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line she could see<br>the raised hood of Prince Andrew’s calèche. She did not know who was<br>in it, but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that<br>calèche. She knew it was right in front.<br><br>In Kúdrino, from the Nikítski, Présnya, and Podnovínsk Streets came<br>several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rostóvs’, and as they<br>passed along the Sadóvaya Street the carriages and carts formed two rows<br>abreast.<br><br>As they were going round the Súkharev water tower Natásha, who was<br>inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking<br>past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:<br><br>“Dear me! Mamma, Sónya, look, it’s he!”<br><br>“Who? Who?”<br><br>“Look! Yes, on my word, it’s Bezúkhov!” said Natásha, putting her head<br>out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a coachman’s<br>long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently<br>a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the arch of the<br>Súkharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced, beardless old man<br>in a frieze coat.<br><br>“Yes, it really is Bezúkhov in a coachman’s coat, with a queer-looking<br>old boy. Really,” said Natásha, “look, look!”<br><br>“No, it’s not he. How can you talk such nonsense?”<br><br>“Mamma,” screamed Natásha, “I’ll stake my head it’s he! I assure you!<br>Stop, stop!” she cried to the coachman.<br><br>But the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshchánski Street came<br>more carts and carriages, and the Rostóvs were being shouted at to move<br>on and not block the way.<br><br>In fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the Rostóvs<br>all saw Pierre—or someone extraordinarily like him—in a coachman’s coat,<br>going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small,<br>beardless old man who looked like a footman. That old man noticed a<br>face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them, and respectfully<br>touching Pierre’s elbow said something to him and pointed to the<br>carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought, could not at first<br>understand him. At length when he had understood and looked in the<br>direction the old man indicated, he recognized Natásha, and following<br>his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach. But<br>having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped.<br><br>Natásha’s face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical<br>kindliness.<br><br>“Peter Kirílovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is<br>wonderful!” she cried, holding out her hand to him. “What are you doing?<br>Why are you like this?”<br><br>Pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked<br>along beside her while the coach still moved on.<br><br>“What is the matter, Count?” asked the countess in a surprised and<br>commiserating tone.<br><br>“What? What? Why? Don’t ask me,” said Pierre, and looked round at<br>Natásha whose radiant, happy expression—of which he was conscious<br>without looking at her—filled him with enchantment.<br><br>“Are you remaining in Moscow, then?”<br><br>Pierre hesitated.<br><br>“In Moscow?” he said in a questioning tone. “Yes, in Moscow. Good-by!”<br><br>“Ah, if only I were a man! I’d certainly stay with you. How splendid!”<br>said Natásha. “Mamma, if you’ll let me, I’ll stay!”<br><br>Pierre glanced absently at Natásha and was about to say something, but<br>the countess interrupted him.<br><br>“You were at the battle, we heard.”<br><br>“Yes, I was,” Pierre answered. “There will be another battle<br>tomorrow...” he began, but Natásha interrupted him.<br><br>“But what is the matter with you, Count? You are not like yourself....”<br><br>“Oh, don’t ask me, don’t ask me! I don’t know myself. Tomorrow... But<br>no! Good-by, good-by!” he muttered. “It’s an awful time!” and dropping<br>behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.<br><br>Natásha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming at<br>him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>For the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had been living<br>in the empty house of his deceased benefactor, Bazdéev. This is how it<br>happened.<br><br>When he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his<br>interview with Count Rostopchín, he could not for some time make out<br>where he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that<br>among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a Frenchman<br>who had brought a letter from his wife, the Countess Hélène, he felt<br>suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which<br>he was apt to succumb. He felt that everything was now at an end, all<br>was in confusion and crumbling to pieces, that nobody was right or<br>wrong, the future held nothing, and there was no escape from this<br>position. Smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself, he first sat<br>down on the sofa in an attitude of despair, then rose, went to the door<br>of the reception room and peeped through the crack, returned flourishing<br>his arms, and took up a book. His major-domo came in a second time to<br>say that the Frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess<br>was very anxious to see him if only for a minute, and that someone from<br>Bazdéev’s widow had called to ask Pierre to take charge of her husband’s<br>books, as she herself was leaving for the country.<br><br>“Oh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... go and say I will<br>come directly,” Pierre replied to the major-domo.<br><br>But as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat which<br>was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door.<br>There was no one in the passage. He went along the whole length of this<br>passage to the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his forehead with<br>both hands, went down as far as the first landing. The hall porter was<br>standing at the front door. From the landing where Pierre stood there<br>was a second staircase leading to the back entrance. He went down that<br>staircase and out into the yard. No one had seen him. But there were<br>some carriages waiting, and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate<br>the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to<br>him. When he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich<br>which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen: he hung his head<br>and quickening his pace went down the street.<br><br>Of all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph<br>Bazdéev’s books and papers appeared to him the most necessary.<br><br>He hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the<br>Patriarch’s Ponds, where the widow Bazdéev’s house was.<br><br>Continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were<br>making their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing his bulky<br>body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle, Pierre,<br>experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school, began to<br>talk to his driver.<br><br>The man told him that arms were being distributed today at the Krémlin<br>and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the Three Hills<br>gates and a great battle would be fought there.<br><br>Having reached the Patriarch’s Ponds Pierre found the Bazdéevs’ house,<br>where he had not been for a long time past. He went up to the gate.<br>Gerásim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at Torzhók five<br>years before with Joseph Bazdéev, came out in answer to his knock.<br><br>“At home?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“Owing to the present state of things Sophia Danílovna has gone to the<br>Torzhók estate with the children, your excellency.”<br><br>“I will come in all the same, I have to look through the books,” said<br>Pierre.<br><br>“Be so good as to step in. Makár Alexéevich, the brother of my late<br>master—may the kingdom of heaven be his—has remained here, but he is in<br>a weak state as you know,” said the old servant.<br><br>Pierre knew that Makár Alexéevich was Joseph Bazdéev’s half-insane<br>brother and a hard drinker.<br><br>“Yes, yes, I know. Let us go in...” said Pierre and entered the house.<br><br>A tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing gown and<br>with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom. On seeing Pierre<br>he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage.<br><br>“He was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble, as your honor<br>sees,” said Gerásim. “Will you step into the study?” Pierre nodded. “As<br>it was sealed up so it has remained, but Sophia Danílovna gave orders<br>that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books.”<br><br>Pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such<br>trepidation in his benefactor’s lifetime. The room, dusty and untouched<br>since the death of Joseph Bazdéev was now even gloomier.<br><br>Gerásim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe. Pierre<br>went round the study, approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts<br>were kept, and took out what had once been one of the most important,<br>the holy of holies of the order. This was the authentic Scotch Acts<br>with Bazdéev’s notes and explanations. He sat down at the dusty writing<br>table, and, having laid the manuscripts before him, opened them out,<br>closed them, finally pushed them away, and resting his head on his hand<br>sank into meditation.<br><br>Gerásim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw Pierre<br>always sitting in the same attitude.<br><br>More than two hours passed and Gerásim took the liberty of making a<br>slight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did not<br>hear him.<br><br>“Is the cabman to be discharged, your honor?”<br><br>“Oh yes!” said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. “Look<br>here,” he added, taking Gerásim by a button of his coat and looking down<br>at the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, “I say, do you<br>know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow?”<br><br>“We heard so,” replied the man.<br><br>“I beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you.”<br><br>“Yes, your excellency,” replied Gerásim. “Will you have something to<br>eat?”<br><br>“No, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes and a pistol,”<br>said Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.<br><br>“Yes, your excellency,” said Gerásim after thinking for a moment.<br><br>All the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor’s study,<br>and Gerásim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and<br>talking to himself. And he spent the night on a bed made up for him<br>there.<br><br>Gerásim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things,<br>accepted Pierre’s taking up his residence in the house without surprise,<br>and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same evening—without<br>even asking himself what they were wanted for—he procured a coachman’s<br>coat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him the pistol next day.<br>Makár Alexéevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes<br>as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at Pierre. But<br>as soon as Pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around<br>him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away. It was when<br>Pierre (wearing the coachman’s coat which Gerásim had procured for him<br>and had disinfected by steam) was on his way with the old man to buy the<br>pistol at the Súkharev market that he met the Rostóvs.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIX<br><br>Kutúzov’s order to retreat through Moscow to the Ryazán road was issued<br>at night on the first of September.<br><br>The first troops started at once, and during the night they marched<br>slowly and steadily without hurry. At daybreak, however, those nearing<br>the town at the Dorogomílov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers<br>crowding and hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the opposite side<br>and blocking the streets and alleys, while endless masses of troops were<br>bearing down on them from behind, and an unreasoning hurry and alarm<br>overcame them. They all rushed forward to the bridge, onto it, and<br>to the fords and the boats. Kutúzov himself had driven round by side<br>streets to the other side of Moscow.<br><br>By ten o’clock in the morning of the second of September, only the rear<br>guard remained in the Dorogomílov suburb, where they had ample room. The<br>main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.<br><br>At that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September,<br>Napoleon was standing among his troops on the Poklónny Hill looking at<br>the panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth of August<br>to the second of September, that is from the battle of Borodinó to the<br>entry of the French into Moscow, during the whole of that agitating,<br>memorable week, there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that<br>always comes as a surprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat<br>than in spring, when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear<br>atmosphere that the eyes smart, when the lungs are strengthened and<br>refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air, when even the nights<br>are warm, and when in those dark warm nights, golden stars startle and<br>delight us continually by falling from the sky.<br><br>At ten in the morning of the second of September this weather still<br>held.<br><br>The brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from the Poklónny<br>Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens, and her<br>churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her cupolas<br>glittering like stars in the sunlight.<br><br>The view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as<br>he had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather envious and<br>uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has<br>no knowledge of them. This city was evidently living with the full force<br>of its own life. By the indefinite signs which, even at a distance,<br>distinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the Poklónny<br>Hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as it were, the<br>breathing of that great and beautiful body.<br><br>Every Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every<br>foreigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the<br>mother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it.<br><br>“Cette ville asiatique aux innombrables églises, Moscou la sainte. La<br>voilà donc enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il était temps,” * said he, and<br>dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and<br>summoned Lelorgne d’Ideville, the interpreter.<br><br>     * “That Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy<br>     Moscow! Here it is then at last, that famous city. It was<br>     high time.”<br><br><br>“A town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,”<br>thought he (he had said so to Túchkov at Smolénsk). From that point of<br>view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before. It seemed<br>strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable,<br>had at last been realized. In the clear morning light he gazed now at<br>the city and now at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance<br>of possessing it agitated and awed him.<br><br>“But could it be otherwise?” he thought. “Here is this capital at my<br>feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange,<br>beautiful, and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In what<br>light must I appear to them!” thought he, thinking of his troops.<br>“Here she is, the reward for all those fainthearted men,” he reflected,<br>glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and<br>forming up. “One word from me, one movement of my hand, and that ancient<br>capital of the Tsars would perish. But my clemency is always ready to<br>descend upon the vanquished. I must be magnanimous and truly great. But<br>no, it can’t be true that I am in Moscow,” he suddenly thought.<br>“Yet here she is lying at my feet, with her golden domes and crosses<br>scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine. But I shall spare her. On<br>the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism I will inscribe great<br>words of justice and mercy.... It is just this which Alexander will<br>feel most painfully, I know him.” (It seemed to Napoleon that the chief<br>import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between<br>himself and Alexander.) “From the height of the Krémlin—yes, there<br>is the Krémlin, yes—I will give them just laws; I will teach them the<br>meaning of true civilization, I will make generations of boyars remember<br>their conqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not,<br>and do not, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false<br>policy of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in<br>Moscow I will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people.<br>I do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored<br>monarch. ‘Boyars,’ I will say to them, ‘I do not desire war, I desire<br>the peace and welfare of all my subjects.’ However, I know their<br>presence will inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do:<br>clearly, impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in<br>Moscow? Yes, there she lies.”<br><br>“Qu’on m’amène les boyars,” * said he to his suite.<br><br>    * “Bring the boyars to me.”<br><br><br>A general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the<br>boyars.<br><br>Two hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the<br>same place on the Poklónny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to<br>the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. That<br>speech was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it.<br><br>He was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to<br>adopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed days for assemblies<br>at the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian notables and his own would<br>mingle. He mentally appointed a governor, one who would win the<br>hearts of the people. Having learned that there were many charitable<br>institutions in Moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors<br>on them all. He thought that, as in Africa he had to put on a burnoose<br>and sit in a mosque, so in Moscow he must be beneficent like the Tsars.<br>And in order finally to touch the hearts of the Russians—and being like<br>all Frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference<br>to ma chère, ma tendre, ma pauvre mère * —he decided that he would<br>place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters:<br>“This establishment is dedicated to my dear mother.” Or no, it should<br>be simply: Maison de ma Mère, *(2) he concluded. “But am I really in<br>Moscow? Yes, here it lies before me, but why is the deputation from the<br>city so long in appearing?” he wondered.<br><br>     * “My dear, my tender, my poor mother.”<br><br>     * (2) “House of my Mother.”<br><br><br>Meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers<br>among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite. Those sent to<br>fetch the deputation had returned with the news that Moscow was empty,<br>that everyone had left it. The faces of those who were not conferring<br>together were pale and perturbed. They were not alarmed by the fact<br>that Moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants (grave as that fact<br>seemed), but by the question how to tell the Emperor—without putting<br>him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculous—that he had been<br>awaiting the boyars so long in vain: that there were drunken mobs left<br>in Moscow but no one else. Some said that a deputation of some sort must<br>be scraped together, others disputed that opinion and maintained that<br>the Emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared, and then<br>told the truth.<br><br>“He will have to be told, all the same,” said some gentlemen of the<br>suite. “But, gentlemen...”<br><br>The position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating upon<br>his magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before the<br>outspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from under<br>his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.<br><br>“But it’s impossible...” declared the gentlemen of the suite, shrugging<br>their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word—le<br>ridicule....<br><br>At last the Emperor, tired of futile expectation, his actor’s instinct<br>suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out<br>was beginning to lose its sublimity, gave a sign with his hand. A single<br>report of a signaling gun followed, and the troops, who were already<br>spread out on different sides of Moscow, moved into the city through the<br>Tver, Kalúga, and Dorogomílov gates. Faster and faster, vying with<br>one another, they moved at the double or at a trot, vanishing amid the<br>clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar<br>of mingling shouts.<br><br>Drawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as far as<br>the Dorogomílov gate, but there again stopped and, dismounting from his<br>horse, paced for a long time by the Kámmer-Kollézski rampart, awaiting<br>the deputation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XX<br><br>Meanwhile Moscow was empty. There were still people in it, perhaps a<br>fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was empty.<br>It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.<br><br>In a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it<br>seems as much alive as other hives.<br><br>The bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday<br>sun as gaily as around the living hives; from a distance it smells of<br>honey like the others, and bees fly in and out in the same way. But one<br>has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any<br>life in it. The bees do not fly in the same way, the smell and the sound<br>that meet the beekeeper are not the same. To the beekeeper’s tap on the<br>wall of the sick hive, instead of the former instant unanimous<br>humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly<br>compressed, and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an<br>aerial living sound, the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from<br>different parts of the deserted hive. From the alighting board, instead<br>of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom, and the warm<br>whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling<br>with the smell of honey. There are no longer sentinels sounding the<br>alarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die in defense of the<br>hive. There is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity,<br>like the sound of boiling water, but diverse discordant sounds of<br>disorder. In and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with<br>honey fly timidly and shiftily. They do not sting, but crawl away from<br>danger. Formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive, and they<br>flew out empty; now they fly out laden. The beekeeper opens the lower<br>part of the hive and peers in. Instead of black, glossy bees—tamed by<br>toil, clinging to one another’s legs and drawing out the wax, with a<br>ceaseless hum of labor—that used to hang in long clusters down to the<br>floor of the hive, drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in<br>various directions on the floor and walls of the hive. Instead of a<br>neatly glued floor, swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings,<br>there is a floor littered with bits of wax, excrement, dying bees<br>scarcely moving their legs, and dead ones that have not been cleared<br>away.<br><br>The beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super.<br>Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and<br>keeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful complex structures of the<br>combs, but no longer in their former state of purity. All is neglected<br>and foul. Black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about<br>the combs, and the short home bees, shriveled and listless as if they<br>were old, creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers,<br>having lost all motive and all sense of life. Drones, bumblebees, wasps,<br>and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their<br>flight. Here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey<br>an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard. Here and there a couple of<br>bees, by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells, with<br>efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or<br>bumblebee without knowing why they do it. In another corner two old bees<br>are languidly fighting, or cleaning themselves, or feeding one another,<br>without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile<br>intent. In a third place a crowd of bees, crushing one another, attack<br>some victim and fight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or<br>killed, drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap<br>of corpses. The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine<br>the brood cells. In place of the former close dark circles formed by<br>thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery<br>of generation, he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of<br>bees. They have almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they<br>had guarded and which is now no more. They reek of decay and death. Only<br>a few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle on the enemy’s<br>hand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the rest are dead and fall<br>as lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper closes the hive, chalks a mark<br>on it, and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean.<br><br>So in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, uneasy, and<br>morose, paced up and down in front of the Kámmer-Kollézski rampart,<br>awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal, observance of<br>the proprieties—a deputation.<br><br>In various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly<br>moving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of what they<br>were doing.<br><br>When with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was<br>empty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently<br>continued to walk to and fro.<br><br>“My carriage!” he said.<br><br>He took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into the<br>suburb. “Moscow deserted!” he said to himself. “What an incredible<br>event!”<br><br>He did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the Dorogomílov<br>suburb.<br><br>The coup de théâtre had not come off.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXI<br><br>The Russian troops were passing through Moscow from two o’clock at night<br>till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the<br>last of the inhabitants who were leaving.<br><br>The greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the<br>Stone, Moskvá, and Yaúza bridges.<br><br>While the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around the<br>Krémlin, were thronging the Moskvá and the Stone bridges, a great many<br>soldiers, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, turned back<br>from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of<br>Vasíli the Beatified and under the Borovítski gate, back up the hill<br>to the Red Square where some instinct told them they could easily take<br>things not belonging to them. Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales<br>filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar. But there were no<br>dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to<br>enter; there were no hawkers, nor the usual motley crowd of female<br>purchasers—but only soldiers, in uniforms and overcoats though without<br>muskets, entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently making their way<br>out through its passages with bundles. Tradesmen and their assistants<br>(of whom there were but few) moved about among the soldiers quite<br>bewildered. They unlocked their shops and locked them up again, and<br>themselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants. On the<br>square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating the muster call.<br>But the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the<br>direction of the drum as formerly, but made them, on the contrary, run<br>farther away. Among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were<br>to be seen in gray coats, with closely shaven heads. Two officers, one<br>with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse,<br>the other in an overcoat and on foot, stood at the corner of Ilyínka<br>Street, talking. A third officer galloped up to them.<br><br>“The general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail.<br>This is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.”<br><br>“Where are you off to?... Where?...” he shouted to three infantrymen<br>without muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were<br>slipping past him into the Bazaar passage. “Stop, you rascals!”<br><br>“But how are you going to stop them?” replied another officer. “There is<br>no getting them together. The army should push on before the rest bolt,<br>that’s all!”<br><br>“How can one push on? They are stuck there, wedged on the bridge, and<br>don’t move. Shouldn’t we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from<br>running away?”<br><br>“Come, go in there and drive them out!” shouted the senior officer.<br><br>The officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went with<br>him into the arcade. Some soldiers started running away in a group. A<br>shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose, and a calm,<br>persistent, calculating expression on his plump face, hurriedly and<br>ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his arms.<br><br>“Your honor!” said he. “Be so good as to protect us! We won’t grudge<br>trifles, you are welcome to anything—we shall be delighted! Pray!...<br>I’ll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman,<br>or even two pieces with pleasure. For we feel how it is; but what’s all<br>this—sheer robbery! If you please, could not guards be placed if only to<br>let us close the shop....”<br><br>Several shopkeepers crowded round the officer.<br><br>“Eh, what twaddle!” said one of them, a thin, stern-looking man. “When<br>one’s head is gone one doesn’t weep for one’s hair! Take what any of you<br>like!” And flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the<br>officer.<br><br>“It’s all very well for you, Iván Sidórych, to talk,” said the first<br>tradesman angrily. “Please step inside, your honor!”<br><br>“Talk indeed!” cried the thin one. “In my three shops here I have a<br>hundred thousand rubles’ worth of goods. Can they be saved when the army<br>has gone? Eh, what people! ‘Against God’s might our hands can’t fight.’”<br><br>“Come inside, your honor!” repeated the tradesman, bowing.<br><br>The officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.<br><br>“It’s not my business!” he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one of<br>the passages.<br><br>From one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, and just<br>as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was<br>flung out violently.<br><br>This man, bent double, rushed past the tradesman and the officer. The<br>officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that<br>moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the Moskvá<br>bridge and the officer ran out into the square.<br><br>“What is it? What is it?” he asked, but his comrade was already<br>galloping off past Vasíli the Beatified in the direction from which the<br>screams came.<br><br>The officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he reached the<br>bridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing the bridge,<br>several overturned carts, and frightened and laughing faces among the<br>troops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were<br>harnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels.<br>The cart was loaded high, and at the very top, beside a child’s chair<br>with its legs in the air, sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and<br>desperate shrieks. He was told by his fellow officers that the screams<br>of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that<br>General Ermólov, coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were<br>dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge,<br>had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the<br>bridge. The crowd, crushing one another, upsetting carts, and shouting<br>and squeezing desperately, had cleared off the bridge and the troops<br>were now moving forward.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXII<br><br>Meanwhile, the city itself was deserted. There was hardly anyone in the<br>streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and there round<br>the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard. Nobody<br>drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard. The<br>Povarskáya was quite still and deserted. The huge courtyard of the<br>Rostóvs’ house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the<br>horses, and not a soul was to be seen there. In the great drawing<br>room of the house, which had been left with all it contained, were<br>two people. They were the yard porter Ignát, and the page boy Míshka,<br>Vasílich’s grandson who had stayed in Moscow with his grandfather.<br>Míshka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with<br>one finger. The yard porter, his arms akimbo, stood smiling with<br>satisfaction before the large mirror.<br><br>“Isn’t it fine, eh, Uncle Ignát?” said the boy, suddenly beginning to<br>strike the keyboard with both hands.<br><br>“Only fancy!” answered Ignát, surprised at the broadening grin on his<br>face in the mirror.<br><br>“Impudence! Impudence!” they heard behind them the voice of Mávra<br>Kuzmínichna who had entered silently. “How he’s grinning, the fat mug!<br>Is that what you’re here for? Nothing’s cleared away down there and<br>Vasílich is worn out. Just you wait a bit!”<br><br>Ignát left off smiling, adjusted his belt, and went out of the room with<br>meekly downcast eyes.<br><br>“Aunt, I did it gently,” said the boy.<br><br>“I’ll give you something gently, you monkey you!” cried Mávra<br>Kuzmínichna, raising her arm threateningly. “Go and get the samovar to<br>boil for your grandfather.”<br><br>Mávra Kuzmínichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it, and<br>with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.<br><br>Going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go<br>next—to drink tea in the servants’ wing with Vasílich, or into the<br>storeroom to put away what still lay about.<br><br>She heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street. Someone<br>stopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it.<br>Mávra Kuzmínichna went to the gate.<br><br>“Who do you want?”<br><br>“The count—Count Ilyá Andréevich Rostóv.”<br><br>“And who are you?”<br><br>“An officer, I have to see him,” came the reply in a pleasant, well-bred<br>Russian voice.<br><br>Mávra Kuzmínichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen, with the<br>round face of a Rostóv, entered the yard.<br><br>“They have gone away, sir. Went away yesterday at vespertime,” said<br>Mávra Kuzmínichna cordially.<br><br>The young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating whether to<br>enter or not, clicked his tongue.<br><br>“Ah, how annoying!” he muttered. “I should have come yesterday.... Ah,<br>what a pity.”<br><br>Meanwhile, Mávra Kuzmínichna was attentively and sympathetically<br>examining the familiar Rostóv features of the young man’s face, his<br>tattered coat and trodden-down boots.<br><br>“What did you want to see the count for?” she asked.<br><br>“Oh well... it can’t be helped!” said he in a tone of vexation and<br>placed his hand on the gate as if to leave.<br><br>He again paused in indecision.<br><br>“You see,” he suddenly said, “I am a kinsman of the count’s and he has<br>been very kind to me. As you see” (he glanced with an amused air and<br>good-natured smile at his coat and boots) “my things are worn out and I<br>have no money, so I was going to ask the count...”<br><br>Mávra Kuzmínichna did not let him finish.<br><br>“Just wait a minute, sir. One little moment,” said she.<br><br>And as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and,<br>hurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard to the<br>servants’ quarters.<br><br>While Mávra Kuzmínichna was running to her room the officer walked about<br>the yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered head and a faint<br>smile on his lips. “What a pity I’ve missed Uncle! What a nice old<br>woman! Where has she run off to? And how am I to find the nearest way<br>to overtake my regiment, which must by now be getting near the Rogózhski<br>gate?” thought he. Just then Mávra Kuzmínichna appeared from behind<br>the corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look, carrying a<br>rolled-up check kerchief in her hand. While still a few steps from<br>the officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white<br>twenty-five-ruble assignat and hastily handed it to him.<br><br>“If his excellency had been at home, as a kinsman he would of course...<br>but as it is...”<br><br>Mávra Kuzmínichna grew abashed and confused. The officer did not<br>decline, but took the note quietly and thanked her.<br><br>“If the count had been at home...” Mávra Kuzmínichna went on<br>apologetically. “Christ be with you, sir! May God preserve you!” said<br>she, bowing as she saw him out.<br><br>Swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself, the officer ran<br>almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the Yaúza bridge to<br>overtake his regiment.<br><br>But Mávra Kuzmínichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist<br>eyes, pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of<br>motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXIII<br><br>From an unfinished house on the Varvárka, the ground floor of which was<br>a dramshop, came drunken shouts and songs. On benches round the tables<br>in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands. Tipsy and perspiring,<br>with dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were all laboriously singing<br>some song or other. They were singing discordantly, arduously, and with<br>great effort, evidently not because they wished to sing, but because<br>they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree. One, a tall,<br>fair-haired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing over the others. His<br>face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not<br>been for his thin, compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed<br>eyes. Evidently possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were<br>singing, and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white<br>arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread<br>out his dirty fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he<br>always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it were<br>most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be<br>bare. In the midst of the song cries were heard, and fighting and blows<br>in the passage and porch. The tall lad waved his arm.<br><br>“Stop it!” he exclaimed peremptorily. “There’s a fight, lads!” And,<br>still rolling up his sleeve, he went out to the porch.<br><br>The factory hands followed him. These men, who under the leadership of<br>the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning, had brought the<br>publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served<br>them. The blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy, hearing the sounds of<br>revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into, wished<br>to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted.<br><br>The publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door, and when the<br>workmen came out the smith, wrenching himself free from the tavern<br>keeper, fell face downward on the pavement.<br><br>Another smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against the publican<br>with his chest.<br><br>The lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and<br>cried wildly: “They’re fighting us, lads!”<br><br>At that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised<br>face to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: “Police! Murder!...<br>They’ve killed a man, lads!”<br><br>“Oh, gracious me, a man beaten to death—killed!...” screamed a woman<br>coming out of a gate close by.<br><br>A crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.<br><br>“Haven’t you robbed people enough—taking their last shirts?” said a<br>voice addressing the publican. “What have you killed a man for, you<br>thief?”<br><br>The tall lad, standing in the porch, turned his bleared eyes from the<br>publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to<br>fight now.<br><br>“Murderer!” he shouted suddenly to the publican. “Bind him, lads!”<br><br>“I daresay you would like to bind me!” shouted the publican, pushing<br>away the men advancing on him, and snatching his cap from his head he<br>flung it on the ground.<br><br>As if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance, the<br>workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision.<br><br>“I know the law very well, mates! I’ll take the matter to the captain<br>of police. You think I won’t get to him? Robbery is not permitted to<br>anybody nowadays!” shouted the publican, picking up his cap.<br><br>“Come along then! Come along then!” the publican and the tall young<br>fellow repeated one after the other, and they moved up the street<br>together.<br><br>The bloodstained smith went beside them. The factory hands and others<br>followed behind, talking and shouting.<br><br>At the corner of the Moroséyka, opposite a large house with closed<br>shutters and bearing a bootmaker’s signboard, stood a score of thin,<br>worn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and long tattered<br>coats.<br><br>“He should pay folks off properly,” a thin workingman, with frowning<br>brows and a straggly beard, was saying.<br><br>“But he’s sucked our blood and now he thinks he’s quit of us. He’s been<br>misleading us all the week and now that he’s brought us to this pass<br>he’s made off.”<br><br>On seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased<br>speaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving<br>crowd.<br><br>“Where are all the folks going?”<br><br>“Why, to the police, of course!”<br><br>“I say, is it true that we have been beaten?” “And what did you think?<br>Look what folks are saying.”<br><br>Questions and answers were heard. The publican, taking advantage of the<br>increased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.<br><br>The tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his<br>bare arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention<br>to himself. It was around him that the people chiefly crowded, expecting<br>answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds.<br><br>“He must keep order, keep the law, that’s what the government is there<br>for. Am I not right, good Christians?” said the tall youth, with a<br>scarcely perceptible smile. “He thinks there’s no government! How can<br>one do without government? Or else there would be plenty who’d rob us.”<br><br>“Why talk nonsense?” rejoined voices in the crowd. “Will they give<br>up Moscow like this? They told you that for fun, and you believed it!<br>Aren’t there plenty of troops on the march? Let him in, indeed! That’s<br>what the government is for. You’d better listen to what people are<br>saying,” said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth.<br><br>By the wall of China-Town a smaller group of people were gathered round<br>a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand.<br><br>“An ukáse, they are reading an ukáse! Reading an ukáse!” cried voices in<br>the crowd, and the people rushed toward the reader.<br><br>The man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 31. When<br>the crowd collected round him he seemed confused, but at the demand<br>of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a rather<br>tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning.<br><br>“Early tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness,” he read (“Sirin<br>Highness,” said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and<br>a frown on his brow), “to consult with him to act, and to aid the army<br>to exterminate these scoundrels. We too will take part...” the reader<br>went on, and then paused (“Do you see,” shouted the youth victoriously,<br>“he’s going to clear up the whole affair for you....”), “in destroying<br>them, and will send these visitors to the devil. I will come back to<br>dinner, and we’ll set to work. We will do, completely do, and undo these<br>scoundrels.”<br><br>The last words were read out in the midst of complete silence. The tall<br>lad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one had understood<br>the last part. In particular, the words “I will come back to dinner,”<br>evidently displeased both reader and audience. The people’s minds<br>were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly<br>comprehensible—it was what any one of them might have said and therefore<br>was what an ukáse emanating from the highest authority should not say.<br><br>They all stood despondent and silent. The tall youth moved his lips and<br>swayed from side to side.<br><br>“We should ask him... that’s he himself?”... “Yes, ask him indeed!...<br>Why not? He’ll explain”... voices in the rear of the crowd were<br>suddenly heard saying, and the general attention turned to the police<br>superintendent’s trap which drove into the square attended by two<br>mounted dragoons.<br><br>The superintendent of police, who had gone that morning by Count<br>Rostopchín’s orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that<br>matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his<br>pocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to<br>stop.<br><br>“What people are these?” he shouted to the men, who were moving singly<br>and timidly in the direction of his trap.<br><br>“What people are these?” he shouted again, receiving no answer.<br><br>“Your honor...” replied the shopman in the frieze coat, “your honor, in<br>accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count, they<br>desire to serve, not sparing their lives, and it is not any kind of<br>riot, but as his highest excellence said...”<br><br>“The count has not left, he is here, and an order will be issued<br>concerning you,” said the superintendent of police. “Go on!” he ordered<br>his coachman.<br><br>The crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what the<br>superintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap.<br><br>The superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared<br>look, said something to his coachman, and his horses increased their<br>speed.<br><br>“It’s a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!” shouted the tall<br>youth. “Don’t let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!” shouted<br>different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap.<br><br>Following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went<br>in the direction of the Lubyánka Street.<br><br>“There now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to<br>perish. Do they think we’re dogs?” voices in the crowd were heard saying<br>more and more frequently.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXIV<br><br>On the evening of the first of September, after his interview with<br>Kutúzov, Count Rostopchín had returned to Moscow mortified and offended<br>because he had not been invited to attend the council of war, and<br>because Kutúzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the<br>defense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him<br>at the camp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its<br>patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and<br>unimportant matters. Distressed, offended, and surprised by all this,<br>Rostopchín had returned to Moscow. After supper he lay down on a sofa<br>without undressing, and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier<br>bringing him a letter from Kutúzov. This letter requested the count to<br>send police officers to guide the troops through the town, as the army<br>was retreating to the Ryazán road beyond Moscow. This was not news to<br>Rostopchín. He had known that Moscow would be abandoned not merely since<br>his interview the previous day with Kutúzov on the Poklónny Hill but<br>ever since the battle of Borodinó, for all the generals who came to<br>Moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to<br>fight another battle, and since then the government property had been<br>removed every night, and half the inhabitants had left the city<br>with Rostopchín’s own permission. Yet all the same this information<br>astonished and irritated the count, coming as it did in the form of a<br>simple note with an order from Kutúzov, and received at night, breaking<br>in on his beauty sleep.<br><br>When later on in his memoirs Count Rostopchín explained his actions at<br>this time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important<br>considerations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow and expedite the<br>departure of the inhabitants. If one accepts this twofold aim all<br>Rostopchín’s actions appear irreproachable. “Why were the holy relics,<br>the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed? Why<br>were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that Moscow would<br>not be given up—and thereby ruined?” “To preserve the tranquillity<br>of the city,” explains Count Rostopchín. “Why were bundles of useless<br>papers from the government offices, and Leppich’s balloon and other<br>articles removed?” “To leave the town empty,” explains Count Rostopchín.<br>One need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action<br>finds a justification.<br><br>All the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for<br>public tranquillity.<br><br>On what, then, was Count Rostopchín’s fear for the tranquillity of<br>Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any probability<br>of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving it and the<br>retreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause the masses to<br>riot?<br><br>Neither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling an<br>insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than<br>ten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of<br>September, and except for a mob in the governor’s courtyard, assembled<br>there at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would<br>have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people<br>if after the battle of Borodinó, when the surrender of Moscow became<br>certain or at least probable, Rostopchín instead of exciting the people<br>by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all<br>the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and had told the<br>population plainly that the town would be abandoned.<br><br>Rostopchín, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and<br>impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles<br>and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to<br>be guiding. Ever since the enemy’s entry into Smolénsk he had in<br>imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling<br>of “the heart of Russia.” Not only did it seem to him (as to all<br>administrators) that he controlled the external actions of Moscow’s<br>inhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by<br>means of his broadsheets and posters, written in a coarse tone which the<br>people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in<br>authority. Rostopchín was so pleased with the fine role of leader of<br>popular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of<br>relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display<br>took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under<br>his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do. Though he knew<br>it was coming, he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe<br>that Moscow would be abandoned, and did not prepare for it. The<br>inhabitants left against his wishes. If the government offices were<br>removed, this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count<br>yielded reluctantly. He was absorbed in the role he had created<br>for himself. As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent<br>imagination, though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he<br>knew it only with his intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and<br>did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs.<br><br>All his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful<br>and had any effect on the people is another question) had been simply<br>directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic<br>hatred of the French.<br><br>But when events assumed their true historical character, when expressing<br>hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it was not<br>even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle, when<br>self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before<br>Moscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one man,<br>abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all<br>the depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by Rostopchín<br>suddenly appeared senseless. He unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous,<br>weak, and alone, with no ground to stand on.<br><br>When, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory note<br>from Kutúzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself<br>to blame. All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state<br>property which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it was no<br>longer possible to take the whole of it away.<br><br>“Who is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?” he<br>ruminated. “Not I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Moscow<br>firmly in hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains!<br>Traitors!” he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and<br>traitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever<br>they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in<br>which he found himself.<br><br>All that night Count Rostopchín issued orders, for which people came to<br>him from all parts of Moscow. Those about him had never seen the count<br>so morose and irritable.<br><br>“Your excellency, the Director of the Registrar’s Department has sent<br>for instructions.... From the Consistory, from the Senate, from the<br>University, from the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan has sent...<br>asking for information.... What are your orders about the Fire Brigade?<br>From the governor of the prison... from the superintendent of the<br>lunatic asylum...” All night long such announcements were continually<br>being received by the count.<br><br>To all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that<br>orders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair, carefully<br>prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that that somebody<br>would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen.<br><br>“Oh, tell that blockhead,” he said in reply to the question from the<br>Registrar’s Department, “that he should remain to guard his documents.<br>Now why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade? They have<br>horses, let them be off to Vladímir, and not leave them to the French.”<br><br>“Your excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come:<br>what are your commands?”<br><br>“My commands? Let them go away, that’s all.... And let the lunatics<br>out into the town. When lunatics command our armies God evidently means<br>these other madmen to be free.”<br><br>In reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count<br>Rostopchín shouted angrily at the governor:<br><br>“Do you expect me to give you two battalions—which we have not got—for a<br>convoy? Release them, that’s all about it!”<br><br>“Your excellency, there are some political prisoners, Meshkóv,<br>Vereshchágin...”<br><br>“Vereshchágin! Hasn’t he been hanged yet?” shouted Rostopchín. “Bring<br>him to me!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXV<br><br>Toward nine o’clock in the morning, when the troops were already moving<br>through Moscow, nobody came to the count any more for instructions.<br>Those who were able to get away were going of their own accord, those<br>who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do.<br><br>The count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sokólniki, and sat<br>in his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.<br><br>In quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it<br>is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is<br>kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable every<br>administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts. While the<br>sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark,<br>holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself<br>moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding<br>on to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and<br>the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer possible. The ship moves<br>independently with its own enormous motion, the boat hook no longer<br>reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead<br>of appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant,<br>useless, feeble man.<br><br>Rostopchín felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.<br><br>The superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to<br>see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the<br>horses were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintendent of<br>police, after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had<br>received, informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the<br>courtyard and wished to see him.<br><br>Without saying a word Rostopchín rose and walked hastily to his light,<br>luxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold of the<br>handle, let it go again, and went to the window from which he had a<br>better view of the whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in front,<br>flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look. The<br>blood-stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face. A drone of<br>voices was audible through the closed window.<br><br>“Is my carriage ready?” asked Rostopchín, stepping back from the window.<br><br>“It is, your excellency,” replied the adjutant.<br><br>Rostopchín went again to the balcony door.<br><br>“But what do they want?” he asked the superintendent of police.<br><br>“Your excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your<br>orders, to go against the French, and they shouted something about<br>treachery. But it is a turbulent crowd, your excellency—I hardly managed<br>to get away from it. Your excellency, I venture to suggest...”<br><br>“You may go. I don’t need you to tell me what to do!” exclaimed<br>Rostopchín angrily.<br><br>He stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.<br><br>“This is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have done<br>with me!” thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled up<br>within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be<br>attributed. As often happens with passionate people, he was mastered by<br>anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it. “Here is<br>that mob, the dregs of the people,” he thought as he gazed at the crowd:<br>“this rabble they have roused by their folly! They want a victim,”<br>he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm. And this<br>thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim,<br>something on which to vent his rage.<br><br>“Is the carriage ready?” he asked again.<br><br>“Yes, your excellency. What are your orders about Vereshchágin? He is<br>waiting at the porch,” said the adjutant.<br><br>“Ah!” exclaimed Rostopchín, as if struck by an unexpected recollection.<br><br>And rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony.<br>The talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed, and all eyes<br>were raised to the count.<br><br>“Good morning, lads!” said the count briskly and loudly. “Thank you for<br>coming. I’ll come out to you in a moment, but we must first settle<br>with the villain. We must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of<br>Moscow. Wait for me!”<br><br>And the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door<br>behind him.<br><br>A murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd. “He’ll<br>settle with all the villains, you’ll see! And you said the French...<br>He’ll show you what law is!” the mob were saying as if reproving one<br>another for their lack of confidence.<br><br>A few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door,<br>gave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved<br>eagerly from the balcony toward the porch. Rostopchín, coming out there<br>with quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking someone.<br><br>“Where is he?” he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man coming<br>round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a long thin<br>neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again covered by<br>short hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat<br>lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty hempen convict<br>trousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty, trodden-down boots.<br>On his thin, weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute<br>movements.<br><br>“Ah!” said Rostopchín, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young<br>man in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch.<br>“Put him there.”<br><br>The young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot<br>indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed<br>his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed, and<br>submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.<br><br>For several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step<br>the silence continued. Only among the back rows of the people, who were<br>all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs, groans, and the shuffling<br>of feet be heard.<br><br>While waiting for the young man to take his place on the step Rostopchín<br>stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.<br><br>“Lads!” said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. “This man,<br>Vereshchágin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing.”<br><br>The young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a<br>submissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated young<br>face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down hopelessly. At<br>the count’s first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if<br>wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye. But Rostopchín did<br>not look at him. A vein in the young man’s long thin neck swelled like a<br>cord and went blue behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed.<br><br>All eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered more<br>hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled sadly<br>and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.<br><br>“He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to<br>Bonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian name,<br>he has caused Moscow to perish,” said Rostopchín in a sharp, even voice,<br>but suddenly he glanced down at Vereshchágin who continued to stand in<br>the same submissive attitude. As if inflamed by the sight, he raised his<br>arm and addressed the people, almost shouting:<br><br>“Deal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you.”<br><br>The crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to<br>one another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling<br>atmosphere, to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown,<br>uncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those standing<br>in front, who had seen and heard what had taken place before them, all<br>stood with wide-open eyes and mouths, straining with all their strength,<br>and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them.<br><br>“Beat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian name!”<br>shouted Rostopchín. “Cut him down. I command it.”<br><br>Hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopchín’s voice,<br>the crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.<br><br>“Count!” exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of Vereshchágin in the<br>midst of the momentary silence that ensued, “Count! One God is above us<br>both....” He lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck<br>filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face.<br><br>He did not finish what he wished to say.<br><br>“Cut him down! I command it...” shouted Rostopchín, suddenly growing<br>pale like Vereshchágin.<br><br>“Draw sabers!” cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.<br><br>Another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the<br>front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The tall<br>youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm, stood<br>beside Vereshchágin.<br><br>“Saber him!” the dragoon officer almost whispered.<br><br>And one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury,<br>struck Vereshchágin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.<br><br>“Ah!” cried Vereshchágin in meek surprise, looking round with a<br>frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him. A<br>similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd. “O Lord!”<br>exclaimed a sorrowful voice.<br><br>But after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from Vereshchágin<br>he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal. The barrier<br>of human feeling, strained to the utmost, that had held the crowd in<br>check suddenly broke. The crime had begun and must now be completed. The<br>plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar<br>of the crowd. Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship, that<br>last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks,<br>carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all. The dragoon was<br>about to repeat his blow. Vereshchágin with a cry of horror, covering<br>his head with his hands, rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth,<br>against whom he stumbled, seized his thin neck with his hands and,<br>yelling wildly, fell with him under the feet of the pressing, struggling<br>crowd.<br><br>Some beat and tore at Vereshchágin, others at the tall youth. And the<br>screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to<br>rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd. It was a long<br>time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth, beaten<br>almost to death. And for a long time, despite the feverish haste with<br>which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun, those who were<br>hitting, throttling, and tearing at Vereshchágin were unable to kill<br>him, for the crowd pressed from all sides, swaying as one mass with them<br>in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or<br>let him go.<br><br>“Hit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold Christ....<br>Still alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture serves a thief<br>right. Use the hatchet!... What—still alive?”<br><br>Only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a<br>long-drawn, measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate,<br>bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each one came<br>up, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and<br>astonishment pushed back again.<br><br>“O Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?” voices<br>in the crowd could be heard saying. “Quite a young fellow too... must<br>have been a merchant’s son. What men!... and they say he’s not the right<br>one.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And there’s another has been<br>beaten too—they say he’s nearly done for.... Oh, the people... Aren’t<br>they afraid of sinning?...” said the same mob now, looking with pained<br>distress at the dead body with its long, thin, half-severed neck and its<br>livid face stained with blood and dust.<br><br>A painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse in<br>his excellency’s courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it away.<br>Two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the<br>ground. The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its long neck<br>trailed twisting along the ground. The crowd shrank back from it.<br><br>At the moment when Vereshchágin fell and the crowd closed in with savage<br>yells and swayed about him, Rostopchín suddenly turned pale and, instead<br>of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him, went<br>with hurried steps and bent head, not knowing where and why, along the<br>passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor. The count’s face was<br>white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw.<br><br>“This way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way,<br>please...” said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.<br><br>Count Rostopchín was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went in<br>the direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his calèche. The<br>distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He hastily<br>took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in<br>Sokólniki.<br><br>When they reached the Myasnítski Street and could no longer hear<br>the shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with<br>dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his<br>subordinates. “The mob is terrible—disgusting,” he said to himself<br>in French. “They are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease.”<br>“Count! One God is above us both!”—Vereshchágin’s words suddenly<br>recurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this<br>was only a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchín smiled disdainfully<br>at himself. “I had other duties,” thought he. “The people had to be<br>appeased. Many other victims have perished and are perishing for the<br>public good”—and he began thinking of his social duties to his family<br>and to the city entrusted to him, and of himself—not himself as Theodore<br>Vasílyevich Rostopchín (he fancied that Theodore Vasílyevich Rostopchín<br>was sacrificing himself for the public good) but himself as governor,<br>the representative of authority and of the Tsar. “Had I been simply<br>Theodore Vasílyevich my course of action would have been quite<br>different, but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as<br>commander in chief.”<br><br>Lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer<br>hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopchín grew physically<br>calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became physically tranquil<br>his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too. The<br>thought which tranquillized Rostopchín was not a new one. Since the<br>world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed<br>such a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with<br>this same idea. This idea is le bien public, the hypothetical welfare of<br>other people.<br><br>To a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he<br>who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies. And<br>Rostopchín now knew it.<br><br>Not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but<br>he even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully<br>contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a<br>criminal and at the same time pacify the mob.<br><br>“Vereshchágin was tried and condemned to death,” thought Rostopchín<br>(though the Senate had only condemned Vereshchágin to hard labor), “he<br>was a traitor and a spy. I could not let him go unpunished and so I have<br>killed two birds with one stone: to appease the mob I gave them a victim<br>and at the same time punished a miscreant.”<br><br>Having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic<br>arrangements, the count grew quite tranquil.<br><br>Half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the<br>Sokólniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering<br>what was to come. He was driving to the Yaúza bridge where he had heard<br>that Kutúzov was. Count Rostopchín was mentally preparing the angry and<br>stinging reproaches he meant to address to Kutúzov for his deception. He<br>would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all<br>the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the<br>ruin of Russia (as Rostopchín regarded it) would fall upon his doting<br>old head. Planning beforehand what he would say to Kutúzov, Rostopchín<br>turned angrily in his calèche and gazed sternly from side to side.<br><br>The Sokólniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of the<br>almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in white<br>and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and<br>gesticulating.<br><br>One of these was running to cross the path of Count Rostopchín’s<br>carriage, and the count himself, his coachman, and his dragoons<br>looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and<br>especially at the one running toward them.<br><br>Swaying from side to side on his long, thin legs in his fluttering<br>dressing gown, this lunatic was running impetuously, his gaze fixed on<br>Rostopchín, shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him<br>to stop. The lunatic’s solemn, gloomy face was thin and yellow, with<br>its beard growing in uneven tufts. His black, agate pupils with<br>saffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids.<br><br>“Stop! Pull up, I tell you!” he cried in a piercing voice, and again<br>shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures.<br><br>Coming abreast of the calèche he ran beside it.<br><br>“Thrice have they slain me, thrice have I risen from the dead. They<br>stoned me, crucified me... I shall rise... shall rise... shall rise.<br>They have torn my body. The kingdom of God will be overthrown... Thrice<br>will I overthrow it and thrice re-establish it!” he cried, raising his<br>voice higher and higher.<br><br>Count Rostopchín suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed<br>in on Vereshchágin. He turned away. “Go fas... faster!” he cried in a<br>trembling voice to his coachman. The calèche flew over the ground as<br>fast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time Count Rostopchín<br>still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the<br>distance, while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished, frightened,<br>bloodstained face of “the traitor” in the fur-lined coat.<br><br>Recent as that mental picture was, Rostopchín already felt that it had<br>cut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt clearly that<br>the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time, but that<br>the terrible memory would, on the contrary, dwell in his heart ever more<br>cruelly and painfully to the end of his life. He seemed still to hear<br>the sound of his own words: “Cut him down! I command it....”<br><br>“Why did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said them....<br>I need not have said them,” he thought. “And then nothing would have<br>happened.” He saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon<br>who dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid reproach that boy in the<br>fur-lined coat had turned upon him. “But I did not do it for my own<br>sake. I was bound to act that way.... The mob, the traitor... the public<br>welfare,” thought he.<br><br>Troops were still crowding at the Yaúza bridge. It was hot. Kutúzov,<br>dejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his<br>whip in the sand when a calèche dashed up noisily. A man in a general’s<br>uniform with plumes in his hat went up to Kutúzov and said something<br>in French. It was Count Rostopchín. He told Kutúzov that he had come<br>because Moscow, the capital, was no more and only the army remained.<br><br>“Things would have been different if your Serene Highness had not told<br>me that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle; all this<br>would not have happened,” he said.<br><br>Kutúzov looked at Rostopchín as if, not grasping what was said to him,<br>he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the<br>face of the man addressing him. Rostopchín grew confused and became<br>silent. Kutúzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating<br>gaze from Rostopchín’s face muttered softly:<br><br>“No! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!”<br><br>Whether Kutúzov was thinking of something entirely different when<br>he spoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be<br>meaningless, at any rate Rostopchín made no reply and hastily left him.<br>And strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count Rostopchín,<br>took up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts<br>to drive on the carts that blocked the way.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXVI<br><br>Toward four o’clock in the afternoon Murat’s troops were entering<br>Moscow. In front rode a detachment of Württemberg hussars and behind<br>them rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite.<br><br>About the middle of the Arbát Street, near the Church of the Miraculous<br>Icon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the advanced<br>detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel, le<br>Kremlin.<br><br>Around Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow. They<br>all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, long-haired commander<br>dressed up in feathers and gold.<br><br>“Is that their Tsar himself? He’s not bad!” low voices could be heard<br>saying.<br><br>An interpreter rode up to the group.<br><br>“Take off your cap... your caps!” These words went from one to another<br>in the crowd. The interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if<br>it was far to the Krémlin. The porter, listening in perplexity to the<br>unfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was<br>speaking Russian, did not understand what was being said to him and<br>slipped behind the others.<br><br>Murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the Russian<br>army was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and several<br>voices at once began answering the interpreter. A French officer,<br>returning from the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat and reported<br>that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was<br>probably an ambuscade there.<br><br>“Good!” said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite,<br>ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates.<br><br>The guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and advanced<br>up the Arbát. When they reached the end of the Vozdvízhenka Street they<br>halted and drew in the Square. Several French officers superintended the<br>placing of the guns and looked at the Krémlin through field glasses.<br><br>The bells in the Krémlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound<br>troubled the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. A few<br>infantrymen ran to the Kutáfyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens had been<br>put there, and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as<br>an officer and men began to run toward it. A general who was standing<br>by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer, and the latter<br>ran back again with his men.<br><br>The sound of three more shots came from the gate.<br><br>One shot struck a French soldier’s foot, and from behind the screens<br>came the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at a<br>word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of<br>the French general, officers, and men changed to one of determined<br>concentrated readiness for strife and suffering. To all of them from<br>the marshal to the least soldier, that place was not the Vozdvízhenka,<br>Mokhaváya, or Kutáfyev Street, nor the Tróitsa Gate (places familiar in<br>Moscow), but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary.<br>And all made ready for that battle. The cries from the gates ceased. The<br>guns were advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks,<br>and an officer gave the word “Fire!” This was followed by two whistling<br>sounds of canister shot, one after another. The shot rattled against<br>the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens, and two<br>wavering clouds of smoke rose over the Square.<br><br>A few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the<br>stone-built Krémlin had died away the French heard a strange sound above<br>their head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the<br>air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings. Together with that sound<br>came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared<br>the figure of a bareheaded man in a peasant’s coat. He grasped a musket<br>and took aim at the French. “Fire!” repeated the officer once more,<br>and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard<br>simultaneously. The gate was again hidden by smoke.<br><br>Nothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry soldiers<br>and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three wounded and<br>four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall,<br>toward the Známenka.<br><br>“Clear that away!” said the officer, pointing to the beams and the<br>corpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw<br>the corpses over the parapet.<br><br>Who these men were nobody knew. “Clear that away!” was all that was said<br>of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that<br>they might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to<br>their memory: “These wretches had occupied the sacred citadel, having<br>supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal, and fired” (the<br>wretches) “at the French. Some of them were sabered and the Krémlin was<br>purged of their presence.”<br><br>Murat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French entered<br>the gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of the<br>windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the Square<br>for fuel and kindled fires there.<br><br>Other detachments passed through the Krémlin and encamped along<br>the Moroséyka, the Lubyánka, and Pokróvka Streets. Others quartered<br>themselves along the Vozdvízhenka, the Nikólski, and the Tverskóy<br>Streets. No masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French were<br>not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as<br>in a camp.<br><br>Though tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their<br>original number, the French entered Moscow in good marching order. It<br>was a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army. But<br>it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their<br>different lodgings. As soon as the men of the various regiments began<br>to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the army was lost<br>forever and there came into being something nondescript, neither<br>citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders. When five weeks<br>later these same men left Moscow, they no longer formed an army. They<br>were a mob of marauders, each carrying a quantity of articles which<br>seemed to him valuable or useful. The aim of each man when he left<br>Moscow was no longer, as it had been, to conquer, but merely to keep<br>what he had acquired. Like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow<br>neck of a jug, and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its<br>fist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore perishes, the<br>French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish because they<br>carried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they had stolen was as<br>impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let<br>go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment had entered a Moscow<br>district, not a soldier or officer was left. Men in military uniforms<br>and Hessian boots could be seen through the windows, laughing and<br>walking through the rooms. In cellars and storerooms similar men were<br>busy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or breaking open<br>coach house and stable doors, lighting fires in kitchens and kneading<br>and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening,<br>amusing, or caressing women and children. There were many such men both<br>in the shops and houses—but there was no army.<br><br>Order after order was issued by the French commanders that day<br>forbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding any<br>violence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a roll call<br>for that very evening. But despite all these measures the men, who had<br>till then constituted an army, flowed all over the wealthy, deserted<br>city with its comforts and plentiful supplies. As a hungry herd of<br>cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field, but gets out<br>of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich<br>pastures, so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city.<br><br>No residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers—like water<br>percolating through sand—spread irresistibly through the city in all<br>directions from the Krémlin into which they had first marched. The<br>cavalry, on entering a merchant’s house that had been abandoned and<br>finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on,<br>all the same, to the next house which seemed to them better. Many of<br>them appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and<br>quarreled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they had<br>had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to<br>see the city and, hearing that everything had been abandoned, rushed<br>to places where valuables were to be had for the taking. The officers<br>followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing<br>the same. In Carriage Row carriages had been left in the shops, and<br>generals flocked there to select calèches and coaches for themselves.<br>The few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to<br>their houses, hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered.<br>There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around<br>the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored<br>and unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be found.<br>And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is<br>spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and<br>mud results; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the<br>rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction<br>of both the army and the wealthy city.<br><br><br>The French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme féroce de<br>Rostopchíne, * the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality,<br>however, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning<br>of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible<br>for it. Moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which<br>any town built of wood was bound to burn, quite apart from whether it<br>had, or had not, a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines. Deserted<br>Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on<br>which sparks continually fall for several days. A town built of wood,<br>where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners<br>are in residence and a police force is present, cannot help burning when<br>its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke<br>pipes, make campfires of the Senate chairs in the Senate Square, and<br>cook themselves meals twice a day. In peacetime it is only necessary to<br>billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in<br>that district immediately increases. How much then must the probability<br>of fire be increased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops<br>are quartered. “Le patriotisme féroce de Rostopchíne” and the barbarity<br>of the French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire by<br>the soldiers’ pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the carelessness of<br>enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own. Even if there was any<br>arson (which is very doubtful, for no one had any reason to burn the<br>houses—in any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do), arson<br>cannot be regarded as the cause, for the same thing would have happened<br>without any incendiarism.<br><br>    * To Rostopchín’s ferocious patriotism.<br><br>However tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopchín’s<br>ferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later<br>on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is<br>impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the<br>fire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, factory, or house must<br>burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to<br>live and cook their porridge. Moscow was burned by its inhabitants, it<br>is true, but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained<br>in it. Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like<br>Berlin, Vienna, and other towns, simply because its inhabitants<br>abandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and salt, nor<br>bring them the keys of the city.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXVII<br><br>The absorption of the French by Moscow, radiating starwise as it did,<br>only reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by the evening of the<br>second of September.<br><br>After the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances,<br>Pierre was in a state bordering on insanity. He was completely obsessed<br>by one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this thought had<br>taken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of the past,<br>understood nothing of the present, and all he saw and heard appeared to<br>him like a dream.<br><br>He had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life’s demands<br>that enmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was unable<br>to unravel. He had gone to Joseph Alexéevich’s house, on the plea of<br>sorting the deceased’s books and papers, only in search of rest from<br>life’s turmoil, for in his mind the memory of Joseph Alexéevich was<br>connected with a world of eternal, solemn, and calm thoughts, quite<br>contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being<br>drawn. He sought a quiet refuge, and in Joseph Alexéevich’s study he<br>really found it. When he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table<br>in the deathlike stillness of the study, calm and significant memories<br>of the last few days rose one after another in his imagination,<br>particularly of the battle of Borodinó and of that vague sense of his<br>own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth, simplicity,<br>and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they. When<br>Gerásim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking<br>part in the popular defense of Moscow which he knew was projected. And<br>with that object he had asked Gerásim to get him a peasant’s coat and<br>a pistol, confiding to him his intentions of remaining in Joseph<br>Alexéevich’s house and keeping his name secret. Then during the first<br>day spent in inaction and solitude (he tried several times to fix his<br>attention on the Masonic manuscripts, but was unable to do so) the idea<br>that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of<br>his name in connection with Bonaparte’s more than once vaguely presented<br>itself. But the idea that he, L’russe Besuhof, was destined to set a<br>limit to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that<br>often passed through his mind and left no trace behind.<br><br>When, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among<br>the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the Rostóvs and<br>Natásha had said to him: “Are you remaining in Moscow?... How splendid!”<br>the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing,<br>even if Moscow were taken, for him to remain there and do what he was<br>predestined to do.<br><br>Next day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in<br>any way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But when he<br>returned to the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he<br>suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility<br>had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable. He must remain in<br>Moscow, concealing his name, and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and<br>either perish or put an end to the misery of all Europe—which it seemed<br>to him was solely due to Napoleon.<br><br>Pierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparte’s life in 1809<br>by a German student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been shot.<br>And the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his<br>design excited him still more.<br><br>Two equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose.<br>The first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in<br>view of the common calamity, the same feeling that had caused him to go<br>to Mozháysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the very thick<br>of the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and, in<br>place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed, to sleep<br>on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as Gerásim.<br>The other was that vague and quite Russian feeling of contempt for<br>everything conventional, artificial, and human—for everything the<br>majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world. Pierre had<br>first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the Slobóda<br>Palace, when he had suddenly felt that wealth, power, and life—all that<br>men so painstakingly acquire and guard—if it has any worth has so only<br>by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced.<br><br>It was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last<br>penny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no<br>apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he<br>possesses: the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from<br>an ordinary point of view are insane, to test, as it were, his personal<br>power and strength, affirming the existence of a higher, nonhuman<br>criterion of life.<br><br>From the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time<br>at the Slobóda Palace he had been continuously under its influence, but<br>only now found full satisfaction for it. Moreover, at this moment Pierre<br>was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he<br>had already done in that direction. If he were now to leave Moscow like<br>everyone else, his flight from home, the peasant coat, the pistol, and<br>his announcement to the Rostóvs that he would remain in Moscow would all<br>become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous, and to<br>this Pierre was very sensitive.<br><br>Pierre’s physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded to his<br>mental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he drank during<br>those days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty unchanged linen,<br>two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without bedding—all<br>this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity.<br><br>It was two o’clock in the afternoon. The French had already entered<br>Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only thought about<br>his undertaking, going over its minutest details in his mind. In his<br>fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the<br>blow or the death of Napoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and<br>melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance.<br><br>“Yes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!” he thought.<br>“Yes, I will approach... and then suddenly... with pistol or dagger?<br>But that is all the same! ‘It is not I but the hand of Providence that<br>punishes thee,’ I shall say,” thought he, imagining what he would say<br>when killing Napoleon. “Well then, take me and execute me!” he went on,<br>speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression.<br><br>While Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to himself<br>in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold appeared<br>the figure of Makár Alexéevich, always so timid before but now quite<br>transformed.<br><br>His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He<br>was obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but<br>noticing embarrassment on Pierre’s face immediately grew bold and,<br>staggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.<br><br>“They’re frightened,” he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. “I say I<br>won’t surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?”<br><br>He paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it<br>with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.<br><br>Gerásim and the porter, who had followed Makár Alexéevich, stopped him<br>in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him. Pierre, coming<br>out into the corridor, looked with pity and repulsion at the half-crazy<br>old man. Makár Alexéevich, frowning with exertion, held on to the pistol<br>and screamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic fancy in his head.<br><br>“To arms! Board them! No, you shan’t get it,” he yelled.<br><br>“That will do, please, that will do. Have the goodness—please, sir, to<br>let go! Please, sir...” pleaded Gerásim, trying carefully to steer Makár<br>Alexéevich by the elbows back to the door.<br><br>“Who are you? Bonaparte!...” shouted Makár Alexéevich.<br><br>“That’s not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow me to<br>have the pistol.”<br><br>“Be off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?” shouted Makár<br>Alexéevich, brandishing the pistol. “Board them!”<br><br>“Catch hold!” whispered Gerásim to the porter.<br><br>They seized Makár Alexéevich by the arms and dragged him to the door.<br><br>The vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of<br>a tipsy, hoarse voice.<br><br>Suddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated from<br>the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.<br><br>“It’s them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!” she<br>cried.<br><br>Gerásim and the porter let Makár Alexéevich go, and in the now silent<br>corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be<br>heard.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXVIII<br><br>Pierre, having decided that until he had carried out his design he would<br>disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French, stood at the<br>half-open door of the corridor, intending to conceal himself as soon<br>as the French entered. But the French entered and still Pierre did not<br>retire—an irresistible curiosity kept him there.<br><br>There were two of them. One was an officer—a tall, soldierly, handsome<br>man—the other evidently a private or an orderly, sunburned, short, and<br>thin, with sunken cheeks and a dull expression. The officer walked in<br>front, leaning on a stick and slightly limping. When he had advanced<br>a few steps he stopped, having apparently decided that these were good<br>quarters, turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in<br>a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses. Having done<br>that, the officer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his<br>mustache and lightly touched his hat.<br><br>“Bonjour, la compagnie!” * said he gaily, smiling and looking about him.<br><br>    * “Good day, everybody!”<br><br><br>No one gave any reply.<br><br>“Vous êtes le bourgeois?” * the officer asked Gerásim.<br><br>    * “Are you the master here?”<br><br><br>Gerásim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.<br><br>“Quartier, quartier, logement!” said the officer, looking down at the<br>little man with a condescending and good-natured smile. “Les français<br>sont de bons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! Ne nous fâchons pas, mon<br>vieux!” * added he, clapping the scared and silent Gerásim on the<br>shoulder. “Well, does no one speak French in this establishment?” he<br>asked again in French, looking around and meeting Pierre’s eyes. Pierre<br>moved away from the door.<br><br>     * “Quarters, quarters, lodgings! The French are good<br>     fellows. What the devil! There, don’t let us be cross, old<br>     fellow!”<br><br><br>Again the officer turned to Gerásim and asked him to show him the rooms<br>in the house.<br><br>“Master, not here—don’t understand... me, you...” said Gerásim, trying<br>to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them.<br><br>Still smiling, the French officer spread out his hands before Gerásim’s<br>nose, intimating that he did not understand him either, and moved,<br>limping, to the door at which Pierre was standing. Pierre wished to go<br>away and conceal himself, but at that moment he saw Makár Alexéevich<br>appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand. With<br>a madman’s cunning, Makár Alexéevich eyed the Frenchman, raised his<br>pistol, and took aim.<br><br>“Board them!” yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the trigger. Hearing<br>the yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment Pierre threw<br>himself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the<br>pistol Makár Alexéevich at last got his fingers on the trigger, there<br>was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The<br>Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.<br><br>Forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French, Pierre,<br>snatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to the officer<br>and addressed him in French.<br><br>“You are not wounded?” he asked.<br><br>“I think not,” answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over. “But I have<br>had a lucky escape this time,” he added, pointing to the damaged plaster<br>of the wall. “Who is that man?” said he, looking sternly at Pierre.<br><br>“Oh, I am really in despair at what has occurred,” said Pierre rapidly,<br>quite forgetting the part he had intended to play. “He is an unfortunate<br>madman who did not know what he was doing.”<br><br>The officer went up to Makár Alexéevich and took him by the collar.<br><br>Makár Alexéevich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about to<br>fall asleep, as he leaned against the wall.<br><br>“Brigand! You shall pay for this,” said the Frenchman, letting go<br>of him. “We French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon<br>traitors,” he added, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic<br>gesture.<br><br>Pierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not to hold that<br>drunken imbecile to account. The Frenchman listened in silence with the<br>same gloomy expression, but suddenly turned to Pierre with a smile. For<br>a few seconds he looked at him in silence. His handsome face assumed a<br>melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand.<br><br>“You have saved my life. You are French,” said he.<br><br>For a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only a Frenchman could<br>perform a great deed, and to save his life—the life of M. Ramballe,<br>captain of the 13th Light Regiment—was undoubtedly a very great deed.<br><br>But however indubitable that conclusion and the officer’s conviction<br>based upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.<br><br>“I am Russian,” he said quickly.<br><br>“Tut, tut, tut! Tell that to others,” said the officer, waving his<br>finger before his nose and smiling. “You shall tell me all about that<br>presently. I am delighted to meet a compatriot. Well, and what are we<br>to do with this man?” he added, addressing himself to Pierre as to a<br>brother.<br><br>Even if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once received that loftiest<br>of human appellations he could not renounce it, said the officer’s look<br>and tone. In reply to his last question Pierre again explained who Makár<br>Alexéevich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile<br>had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from<br>him, and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished.<br><br>The Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his<br>arm.<br><br>“You have saved my life! You are French. You ask his pardon? I grant it<br>you. Lead that man away!” said he quickly and energetically, and taking<br>the arm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for saving his<br>life, he went with him into the room.<br><br>The soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into the passage asking<br>what had happened, and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits,<br>but the officer sternly checked them.<br><br>“You will be called in when you are wanted,” he said.<br><br>The soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had meanwhile had time<br>to visit the kitchen, came up to his officer.<br><br>“Captain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen,” said he.<br>“Shall I serve them up?”<br><br>“Yes, and some wine,” answered the captain.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXIX<br><br>When the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter again<br>thought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and wished to<br>go away, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so very polite,<br>amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his<br>life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat down with him in<br>the parlor—the first room they entered. To Pierre’s assurances that he<br>was not a Frenchman, the captain, evidently not understanding how anyone<br>could decline so flattering an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and<br>said that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it<br>be so, but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude<br>for saving his life.<br><br>Had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the<br>feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre’s feelings<br>were, the latter would probably have left him, but the man’s animated<br>obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed Pierre.<br><br>“A Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,” said the officer, looking<br>at Pierre’s fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger.<br>“I owe my life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman never<br>forgets either an insult or a service. I offer you my friendship. That<br>is all I can say.”<br><br>There was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of the<br>word) in the officer’s voice, in the expression of his face and in<br>his gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the<br>Frenchman’s smile, pressed the hand held out to him.<br><br>“Captain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the Legion<br>of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,” he introduced<br>himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under<br>his mustache. “Will you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have<br>the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance<br>with that maniac’s bullet in my body?”<br><br>Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing,<br>began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for<br>concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.<br><br>“Oh, please!” said he. “I understand your reasons. You are an officer...<br>a superior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us. That’s not<br>my business. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am quite at<br>your service. You belong to the gentry?” he concluded with a shade of<br>inquiry in his tone. Pierre bent his head. “Your baptismal name, if you<br>please. That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you say.... That’s all I<br>want to know.”<br><br>When the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka<br>brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a Russian cellar<br>and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share his dinner, and<br>himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man,<br>munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth, continually smacking<br>his lips, and repeating—“Excellent! Delicious!” His face grew red and<br>was covered with perspiration. Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner<br>with pleasure. Morel, the orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan<br>and placed a bottle of claret in it. He also brought a bottle of kvass,<br>taken from the kitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known<br>to the French and had been given a special name. They called it limonade<br>de cochon (pig’s lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de<br>cochon he had found in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they<br>had taken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and<br>applied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up<br>to its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for<br>Pierre. The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain<br>still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner.<br><br>“Yes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for<br>saving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my<br>body already. Here is one I got at Wagram” (he touched his side) “and a<br>second at Smolénsk”—he showed a scar on his cheek—“and this leg which as<br>you see does not want to march, I got that on the seventh at the great<br>battle of la Moskowa. Sacré Dieu! It was splendid! That deluge of fire<br>was worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us there, my word! You may<br>be proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of the cough I caught there, I<br>should be ready to begin again. I pity those who did not see it.”<br><br>“I was there,” said Pierre.<br><br>“Bah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes. The<br>great redoubt held out well, by my pipe!” continued the Frenchman. “And<br>you made us pay dear for it. I was at it three times—sure as I sit here.<br>Three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back<br>like cardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur Pierre! Your<br>grenadiers were splendid, by heaven! I saw them close up their ranks six<br>times in succession and march as if on parade. Fine fellows! Our King of<br>Naples, who knows what’s what, cried ‘Bravo!’ Ha, ha! So you are one of<br>us soldiers!” he added, smiling, after a momentary pause. “So much<br>the better, so much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible in battle...<br>gallant... with the fair” (he winked and smiled), “that’s what the<br>French are, Monsieur Pierre, aren’t they?”<br><br>The captain was so naïvely and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so<br>pleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily<br>at him. Probably the word “gallant” turned the captain’s thoughts to the<br>state of Moscow.<br><br>“Apropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left<br>Moscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?”<br><br>“Would not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered it?”<br>asked Pierre.<br><br>“Ha, ha, ha!” The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle, patting<br>Pierre on the shoulder. “What a thing to say!” he exclaimed. “Paris?...<br>But Paris, Paris...”<br><br>“Paris—the capital of the world,” Pierre finished his remark for him.<br><br>The captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in the<br>middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly eyes.<br><br>“Well, if you hadn’t told me you were Russian, I should have wagered<br>that you were Parisian! You have that... I don’t know what, that...” and<br>having uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.<br><br>“I have been in Paris. I spent years there,” said Pierre.<br><br>“Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn’t know Paris<br>is a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is Talma, la<br>Duchénois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,” and noticing that<br>his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before, he added quickly:<br>“There is only one Paris in the world. You have been to Paris and have<br>remained Russian. Well, I don’t esteem you the less for it.”<br><br>Under the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days he had<br>spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre involuntarily enjoyed<br>talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.<br><br>“To return to your ladies—I hear they are lovely. What a wretched idea<br>to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army is in<br>Moscow. What a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants, now—that’s<br>another thing; but you civilized people, you ought to know us better<br>than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome, Warsaw, all<br>the world’s capitals.... We are feared, but we are loved. We are nice to<br>know. And then the Emperor...” he began, but Pierre interrupted him.<br><br>“The Emperor,” Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and<br>embarrassed, “is the Emperor...?”<br><br>“The Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, genius—that’s<br>what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure you<br>I was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But<br>that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not resist<br>the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France.<br>When I understood what he wanted—when I saw that he was preparing a bed<br>of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself: ‘That is a monarch,’ and<br>I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest<br>man of the ages past or future.”<br><br>“Is he in Moscow?” Pierre stammered with a guilty look.<br><br>The Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.<br><br>“No, he will make his entry tomorrow,” he replied, and continued his<br>talk.<br><br>Their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at<br>the gate and by Morel, who came to say that some Württemberg hussars had<br>come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captain’s<br>horses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did<br>not understand what was said to them in French.<br><br>The captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern voice<br>asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding officer,<br>and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already<br>occupied. The German who knew little French, answered the two first<br>questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding<br>officer, but in reply to the third question which he did not understand<br>said, introducing broken French into his own German, that he was the<br>quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to<br>occupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who knew German,<br>translated what the German said to the captain and gave the captain’s<br>reply to the Württemberg hussar in German. When he had understood what<br>was said to him, the German submitted and took his men elsewhere. The<br>captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice.<br><br>When he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as<br>before, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He<br>really was suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and he<br>was left alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the position<br>he was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken or that the happy<br>conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him. Painful as<br>that was it was not that which tormented Pierre at the moment. He was<br>tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. The few glasses of<br>wine he had drunk and the conversation with this good-natured man had<br>destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last<br>few days and which was essential for the execution of his design. The<br>pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were ready. Napoleon was to enter the<br>town next day. Pierre still considered that it would be a useful and<br>worthy action to slay the evildoer, but now he felt that he would not<br>do it. He did not know why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not<br>carry out his intention. He struggled against the confession of his<br>weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his<br>former gloomy frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and<br>self-sacrifice, had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first<br>man he met.<br><br>The captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a tune.<br><br>The Frenchman’s chatter which had previously amused Pierre now repelled<br>him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture with which<br>he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. “I will go away<br>immediately. I won’t say another word to him,” thought Pierre. He<br>thought this, but still sat in the same place. A strange feeling of<br>weakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go away, but<br>could not do so.<br><br>The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up and<br>down the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he<br>were smiling to himself at some amusing thought.<br><br>“The colonel of those Württembergers is delightful,” he suddenly said.<br>“He’s a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But he’s a German.”<br>He sat down facing Pierre. “By the way, you know German, then?”<br><br>Pierre looked at him in silence.<br><br>“What is the German for ‘shelter’?”<br><br>“Shelter?” Pierre repeated. “The German for shelter is Unterkunft.”<br><br>“How do you say it?” the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.<br><br>“Unterkunft,” Pierre repeated.<br><br>“Onterkoff,” said the captain and looked at Pierre for some seconds with<br>laughing eyes. “These Germans are first-rate fools, don’t you think so,<br>Monsieur Pierre?” he concluded.<br><br>“Well, let’s have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall we?<br>Morel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!” he called out<br>gaily.<br><br>Morel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at Pierre<br>by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression<br>on his companion’s face. Ramballe, with genuine distress and sympathy in<br>his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.<br><br>“There now, we’re sad,” said he, touching Pierre’s hand. “Have I<br>upset you? No, really, have you anything against me?” he asked Pierre.<br>“Perhaps it’s the state of affairs?”<br><br>Pierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchman’s eyes<br>whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.<br><br>“Honestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for<br>you. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and death.<br>I say it with my hand on my heart!” said he, striking his chest.<br><br>“Thank you,” said Pierre.<br><br>The captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that<br>“shelter” was Unterkunft in German, and his face suddenly brightened.<br><br>“Well, in that case, I drink to our friendship!” he cried gaily, filling<br>two glasses with wine.<br><br>Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied his too,<br>again pressed Pierre’s hand, and leaned his elbows on the table in a<br>pensive attitude.<br><br>“Yes, my dear friend,” he began, “such is fortune’s caprice. Who would<br>have said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the<br>service of Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am in Moscow<br>with him. I must tell you, mon cher,” he continued in the sad and<br>measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story, “that our name<br>is one of the most ancient in France.”<br><br>And with a Frenchman’s easy and naïve frankness the captain told Pierre<br>the story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and manhood, and all<br>about his relations and his financial and family affairs, “ma pauvre<br>mère” playing of course an important part in the story.<br><br>“But all that is only life’s setting, the real thing is love—love! Am I<br>not right, Monsieur Pierre?” said he, growing animated. “Another glass?”<br><br>Pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.<br><br>“Oh, women, women!” and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at<br>Pierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.<br><br>There were very many of these, as one could easily believe, looking<br>at the officer’s handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager<br>enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballe’s love<br>stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special<br>charm and poetry of love, yet he told his story with such sincere<br>conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love<br>and he described women so alluringly that Pierre listened to him with<br>curiosity.<br><br>It was plain that l’amour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not<br>that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor<br>was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for<br>Natásha. (Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the one<br>he considered the “love of clodhoppers” and the other the “love<br>of simpletons.”) L’amour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted<br>principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a<br>combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.<br><br>Thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a<br>fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a charming,<br>innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching marquise. The<br>conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter, ending in<br>the mother’s sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage<br>to her lover, even now agitated the captain, though it was the memory of<br>a distant past. Then he recounted an episode in which the husband played<br>the part of the lover, and he—the lover—assumed the role of the husband,<br>as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of Germany,<br>where “shelter” is called Unterkunft and where the husbands eat<br>sauerkraut and the young girls are “too blonde.”<br><br>Finally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain’s<br>memory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, was<br>of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving of<br>life continually occurred in the captain’s stories) and the Pole had<br>entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de cœur) while himself<br>entering the French service. The captain was happy, the enchanting<br>Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the<br>captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as he did so: “I have<br>saved your life, and I save your honor!” Having repeated these words the<br>captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake, as if driving away the<br>weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection.<br><br>Listening to the captain’s tales, Pierre—as often happens late in the<br>evening and under the influence of wine—followed all that was told him,<br>understood it all, and at the same time followed a train of personal<br>memories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his mind. While<br>listening to these love stories his own love for Natásha unexpectedly<br>rose to his mind, and going over the pictures of that love in his<br>imagination he mentally compared them with Ramballe’s tales. Listening<br>to the story of the struggle between love and duty, Pierre saw before<br>his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of<br>his love at the Súkharev water tower. At the time of that meeting it had<br>not produced an effect upon him—he had not even once recalled it. But<br>now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very<br>important and poetic.<br><br>“Peter Kirílovich, come here! We have recognized you,” he now seemed<br>to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes, her<br>smile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and there<br>seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this.<br><br>Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the captain<br>asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice<br>himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband.<br><br>Challenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to<br>express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that he<br>understood love for a woman somewhat differently. He said that in all<br>his life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she could<br>never be his.<br><br>“Tiens!” said the captain.<br><br>Pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest<br>years, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too<br>young, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name.<br>Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of<br>her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything in<br>the world, and especially therefore above himself.<br><br>When he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether he<br>understood that.<br><br>The captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand<br>it he begged Pierre to continue.<br><br>“Platónic love, clouds...” he muttered.<br><br>Whether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or the<br>thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of those who<br>played a part in his story, or whether it was all these things together,<br>something loosened Pierre’s tongue. Speaking thickly and with a faraway<br>look in his shining eyes, he told the whole story of his life: his<br>marriage, Natásha’s love for his best friend, her betrayal of him, and<br>all his own simple relations with her. Urged on by Ramballe’s questions<br>he also told what he had at first concealed—his own position and even<br>his name.<br><br>More than anything else in Pierre’s story the captain was impressed by<br>the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that<br>he had abandoned everything and not left the city, but remained there<br>concealing his name and station.<br><br>When it was late at night they went out together into the street. The<br>night was warm and light. To the left of the house on the Pokróvka a<br>fire glowed—the first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To the<br>right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and<br>opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in Pierre’s<br>heart with his love. At the gate stood Gerásim, the cook, and two<br>Frenchmen. Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in<br>two languages could be heard. They were looking at the glow seen in the<br>town.<br><br>There was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the immense<br>city.<br><br>Gazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the<br>glow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. “There now,<br>how good it is, what more does one need?” thought he. And suddenly<br>remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned<br>against the fence to save himself from falling.<br><br>Without taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with<br>unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and<br>immediately fell asleep.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXX<br><br>The glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was<br>watched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the<br>retreating troops, with many different feelings.<br><br>The Rostóv party spent the night at Mytíshchi, fourteen miles from<br>Moscow. They had started so late on the first of September, the road<br>had been so blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been<br>forgotten for which servants were sent back, that they had decided to<br>spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow. The next morning<br>they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far<br>as Great Mytíshchi. At ten o’clock that evening the Rostóv family and<br>the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and<br>huts of that large village. The Rostóvs’ servants and coachmen and the<br>orderlies of the wounded officers, after attending to their masters, had<br>supper, fed the horses, and came out into the porches.<br><br>In a neighboring hut lay Raévski’s adjutant with a fractured wrist. The<br>awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously, and his<br>moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night. He had<br>spent the first night in the same yard as the Rostóvs. The countess said<br>she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning, and at<br>Mytíshchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the<br>wounded man.<br><br>In the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above the high<br>body of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow of another<br>fire. One glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was<br>Little Mytíshchi burning—set on fire by Mamónov’s Cossacks.<br><br>“But look here, brothers, there’s another fire!” remarked an orderly.<br><br>All turned their attention to the glow.<br><br>“But they told us Little Mytíshchi had been set on fire by Mamónov’s<br>Cossacks.”<br><br>“But that’s not Mytíshchi, it’s farther away.”<br><br>“Look, it must be in Moscow!”<br><br>Two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down<br>on its steps.<br><br>“It’s more to the left, why, Little Mytíshchi is over there, and this is<br>right on the other side.”<br><br>Several men joined the first two.<br><br>“See how it’s flaring,” said one. “That’s a fire in Moscow: either in<br>the Sushchévski or the Rogózhski quarter.”<br><br>No one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently<br>at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance.<br><br>Old Daniel Teréntich, the count’s valet (as he was called), came up to<br>the group and shouted at Míshka.<br><br>“What are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... The count will be<br>calling and there’s nobody there; go and gather the clothes together.”<br><br>“I only ran out to get some water,” said Míshka.<br><br>“But what do you think, Daniel Teréntich? Doesn’t it look as if that<br>glow were in Moscow?” remarked one of the footmen.<br><br>Daniel Teréntich made no reply, and again for a long time they were all<br>silent. The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and farther still.<br><br>“God have mercy.... It’s windy and dry...” said another voice.<br><br>“Just look! See what it’s doing now. O Lord! You can even see the crows<br>flying. Lord have mercy on us sinners!”<br><br>“They’ll put it out, no fear!”<br><br>“Who’s to put it out?” Daniel Teréntich, who had hitherto been silent,<br>was heard to say. His voice was calm and deliberate. “Moscow it is,<br>brothers,” said he. “Mother Moscow, the white...” his voice faltered,<br>and he gave way to an old man’s sob.<br><br>And it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the<br>significance for them of the glow they were watching. Sighs were heard,<br>words of prayer, and the sobbing of the count’s old valet.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXI<br><br>The valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that Moscow was<br>burning. The count donned his dressing gown and went out to look. Sónya<br>and Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out with him. Only<br>Natásha and the countess remained in the room. Pétya was no longer<br>with the family, he had gone on with his regiment which was making for<br>Tróitsa.<br><br>The countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry. Natásha,<br>pale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the icons just<br>where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her father’s<br>words. She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant, three<br>houses off.<br><br>“Oh, how terrible,” said Sónya returning from the yard chilled and<br>frightened. “I believe the whole of Moscow will burn, there’s an awful<br>glow! Natásha, do look! You can see it from the window,” she said to her<br>cousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.<br><br>But Natásha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her<br>and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had been in<br>this condition of stupor since the morning, when Sónya, to the surprise<br>and annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable reason found<br>it necessary to tell Natásha of Prince Andrew’s wound and of his being<br>with their party. The countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as<br>she was with Sónya. Sónya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now,<br>as if trying to atone for her fault, paid unceasing attention to her<br>cousin.<br><br>“Look, Natásha, how dreadfully it is burning!” said she.<br><br>“What’s burning?” asked Natásha. “Oh, yes, Moscow.”<br><br>And as if in order not to offend Sónya and to get rid of her, she turned<br>her face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was evident<br>that she could not see anything, and again settled down in her former<br>attitude.<br><br>“But you didn’t see it!”<br><br>“Yes, really I did,” Natásha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left<br>in peace.<br><br>Both the countess and Sónya understood that, naturally, neither Moscow<br>nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to<br>Natásha.<br><br>The count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess went<br>up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she<br>was wont to do when Natásha was ill, then touched her forehead with her<br>lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her.<br><br>“You are cold. You are trembling all over. You’d better lie down,” said<br>the countess.<br><br>“Lie down? All right, I will. I’ll lie down at once,” said Natásha.<br><br>When Natásha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously<br>wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first asked many<br>questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it serious? And<br>could she see him? But after she had been told that she could not see<br>him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger,<br>she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving<br>what they told her, and convinced that say what she might she would<br>still be told the same. All the way she had sat motionless in a corner<br>of the coach with wide open eyes, and the expression in them which the<br>countess knew so well and feared so much, and now she sat in the same<br>way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving. She was<br>planning something and either deciding or had already decided something<br>in her mind. The countess knew this, but what it might be she did not<br>know, and this alarmed and tormented her.<br><br>“Natásha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.”<br><br>A bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame Schoss<br>and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.<br><br>“No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,” Natásha replied<br>irritably and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open<br>window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She put<br>her head out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her slim neck<br>shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame. Natásha knew<br>it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in<br>the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage;<br>but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The countess exchanged<br>a look with Sónya.<br><br>“Lie down, darling; lie down, my pet,” said the countess, softly<br>touching Natásha’s shoulders. “Come, lie down.”<br><br>“Oh, yes... I’ll lie down at once,” said Natásha, and began hurriedly<br>undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.<br><br>When she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket, she sat<br>down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the<br>floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front,<br>and began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers rapidly<br>unplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved from side<br>to side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked fixedly before<br>her. When her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the<br>sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door.<br><br>“Natásha, you’d better lie in the middle,” said Sónya.<br><br>“I’ll stay here,” muttered Natásha. “Do lie down,” she added crossly,<br>and buried her face in the pillow.<br><br>The countess, Madame Schoss, and Sónya undressed hastily and lay down.<br>The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in<br>the room. But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little<br>Mytíshchi a mile and a half away, and through the night came the noise<br>of people shouting at a tavern Mamónov’s Cossacks had set up across the<br>street, and the adjutant’s unceasing moans could still be heard.<br><br>For a long time Natásha listened attentively to the sounds that reached<br>her from inside and outside the room and did not move. First she heard<br>her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under<br>her, then Madame Schoss’ familiar whistling snore and Sónya’s gentle<br>breathing. Then the countess called to Natásha. Natásha did not answer.<br><br>“I think she’s asleep, Mamma,” said Sónya softly.<br><br>After a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one<br>replied.<br><br>Soon after that Natásha heard her mother’s even breathing. Natásha did<br>not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt,<br>was growing cold on the bare floor.<br><br>As if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in a<br>crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near<br>by. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of the<br>adjutant was heard. Natásha sat up.<br><br>“Sónya, are you asleep? Mamma?” she whispered.<br><br>No one replied. Natásha rose slowly and carefully, crossed herself, and<br>stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim, supple,<br>bare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping cautiously from one<br>foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and<br>grasped the cold door handle.<br><br>It seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against<br>all the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking with alarm and<br>terror and overflowing with love.<br><br>She opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold,<br>damp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed her. With<br>her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over him, and opened<br>the door into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay. It was dark<br>in there. In the farthest corner, on a bench beside a bed on which<br>something was lying, stood a tallow candle with a long, thick, and<br>smoldering wick.<br><br>From the moment she had been told that morning of Prince Andrew’s wound<br>and his presence there, Natásha had resolved to see him. She did not<br>know why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but felt the<br>more convinced that it was necessary.<br><br>All day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now<br>that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might<br>see. How was he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that incessant<br>moaning of the adjutant’s? Yes, he was altogether like that. In her<br>imagination he was that terrible moaning personified. When she saw an<br>indistinct shape in the corner, and mistook his knees raised under the<br>quilt for his shoulders, she imagined a horrible body there, and stood<br>still in terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her forward. She<br>cautiously took one step and then another, and found herself in the<br>middle of a small room containing baggage. Another man—Timókhin—was<br>lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons, and two others—the<br>doctor and a valet—lay on the floor.<br><br>The valet sat up and whispered something. Timókhin, kept awake by the<br>pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange<br>apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and nightcap.<br>The valet’s sleepy, frightened exclamation, “What do you want? What’s<br>the matter?” made Natásha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the<br>corner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked, she must see him.<br>She passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw<br>Prince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt, and such as she<br>had always seen him.<br><br>He was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his<br>glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his neck,<br>delicate as a child’s, revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt,<br>gave him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, such as she had never<br>seen on him before. She went up to him and with a swift, flexible,<br>youthful movement dropped on her knees.<br><br>He smiled and held out his hand to her.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXII<br><br>Seven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the<br>ambulance station on the field of Borodinó. His feverish state and the<br>inflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctor’s<br>opinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with<br>pleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that his<br>temperature was lower. He had regained consciousness that morning.<br>The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had<br>remained in the calèche, but at Mytíshchi the wounded man himself asked<br>to be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his removal into<br>the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness. When he<br>had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with<br>closed eyes. Then he opened them and whispered softly: “And the tea?”<br>His remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished<br>the doctor. He felt Prince Andrew’s pulse, and to his surprise and<br>dissatisfaction found it had improved. He was dissatisfied because he<br>knew by experience that if his patient did not die now, he would do so<br>a little later with greater suffering. Timókhin, the red-nosed major of<br>Prince Andrew’s regiment, had joined him in Moscow and was being<br>taken along with him, having been wounded in the leg at the battle of<br>Borodinó. They were accompanied by a doctor, Prince Andrew’s valet, his<br>coachman, and two orderlies.<br><br>They gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking with<br>feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and<br>remember something.<br><br>“I don’t want any more. Is Timókhin here?” he asked.<br><br>Timókhin crept along the bench to him.<br><br>“I am here, your excellency.”<br><br>“How’s your wound?”<br><br>“Mine, sir? All right. But how about you?”<br><br>Prince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.<br><br>“Couldn’t one get a book?” he asked.<br><br>“What book?”<br><br>“The Gospels. I haven’t one.”<br><br>The doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he<br>was feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but<br>reasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was<br>uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted the cloak<br>with which he was covered and, making wry faces at the noisome smell of<br>mortifying flesh that came from the wound, began examining that dreadful<br>place. The doctor was very much displeased about something and made a<br>change in the dressings, turning the wounded man over so that he groaned<br>again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony. He kept asking<br>them to get him the book and put it under him.<br><br>“What trouble would it be to you?” he said. “I have not got one. Please<br>get it for me and put it under for a moment,” he pleaded in a piteous<br>voice.<br><br>The doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.<br><br>“You fellows have no conscience,” said he to the valet who was pouring<br>water over his hands. “For just one moment I didn’t look after you...<br>It’s such pain, you know, that I wonder how he can bear it.”<br><br>“By the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under him!”<br>said the valet.<br><br>The first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was the<br>matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked<br>to be carried into the hut after his calèche had stopped at Mytíshchi.<br>After growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he<br>again regained consciousness, and while drinking tea once more recalled<br>all that had happened to him, and above all vividly remembered the<br>moment at the ambulance station when, at the sight of the sufferings of<br>a man he disliked, those new thoughts had come to him which promised him<br>happiness. And those thoughts, though now vague and indefinite, again<br>possessed his soul. He remembered that he had now a new source of<br>happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the Gospels.<br>That was why he asked for a copy of them. The uncomfortable position in<br>which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts,<br>and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete<br>stillness of the night. Everybody near him was sleeping. A cricket<br>chirped from across the passage; someone was shouting and singing in<br>the street; cockroaches rustled on the table, on the icons, and on<br>the walls, and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the<br>candle beside him, the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself<br>like a mushroom.<br><br>His mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually thinks of,<br>feels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, but has the<br>power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to<br>fix his whole attention. A healthy man can tear himself away from the<br>deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can<br>then return again to his own thoughts. But Prince Andrew’s mind was not<br>in a normal state in that respect. All the powers of his mind were more<br>active and clearer than ever, but they acted apart from his will. Most<br>diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously. At times his<br>brain suddenly began to work with a vigor, clearness, and depth it had<br>never reached when he was in health, but suddenly in the midst of its<br>work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength<br>to turn it back again.<br><br>“Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be<br>deprived,” he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut,<br>gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes. “A happiness<br>lying beyond material forces, outside the material influences that act<br>on man—a happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving. Every man<br>can understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only<br>for God. But how did God enjoin that law? And why was the Son...?”<br><br>And suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince Andrew<br>heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality) a<br>soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating<br>“piti-piti-piti,” and then “titi,” and then again “piti-piti-piti,” and<br>“ti-ti” once more. At the same time he felt that above his face, above<br>the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being erected out<br>of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this whispered music.<br>He felt that he had to balance carefully (though it was difficult) so<br>that this airy structure should not collapse; but nevertheless it kept<br>collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic<br>music—“it stretches, stretches, spreading out and stretching,” said<br>Prince Andrew to himself. While listening to this whispering and feeling<br>the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice<br>of needles, he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle, and<br>heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that<br>flopped against his pillow and his face. Each time the fly touched his<br>face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not<br>destroy the structure, though it knocked against the very region of his<br>face where it was rising. But besides this there was something else of<br>importance. It was something white by the door—the statue of a sphinx,<br>which also oppressed him.<br><br>“But perhaps that’s my shirt on the table,” he thought, “and that’s my<br>legs, and that is the door, but why is it always stretching and drawing<br>itself out, and ‘piti-piti-piti’ and ‘ti-ti’ and ‘piti-piti-piti’...?<br>That’s enough, please leave off!” Prince Andrew painfully entreated<br>someone. And suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of<br>his mind with peculiar clearness and force.<br><br>“Yes—love,” he thought again quite clearly. “But not love which loves<br>for something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some reason,<br>but the love which I—while dying—first experienced when I saw my enemy<br>and yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love which is the very<br>essence of the soul and does not require an object. Now again I feel<br>that bliss. To love one’s neighbors, to love one’s enemies, to love<br>everything, to love God in all His manifestations. It is possible to<br>love someone dear to you with human love, but an enemy can only be loved<br>by divine love. That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I<br>loved that man. What has become of him? Is he alive?...<br><br>“When loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but<br>divine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can<br>destroy it. It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people have<br>I hated in my life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as I did<br>her.” And he vividly pictured to himself Natásha, not as he had done in<br>the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight, but for<br>the first time picturing to himself her soul. And he understood her<br>feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now understood for the<br>first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her, the cruelty of his<br>rupture with her. “If only it were possible for me to see her once more!<br>Just once, looking into those eyes to say...”<br><br>“Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!” flopped the fly....<br>And his attention was suddenly carried into another world, a world of<br>reality and delirium in which something particular was happening. In<br>that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall,<br>something was still stretching out, and the candle with its red halo<br>was still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door; but<br>besides all this something creaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and<br>a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the door. And that sphinx had<br>the pale face and shining eyes of the very Natásha of whom he had just<br>been thinking.<br><br>“Oh, how oppressive this continual delirium is,” thought Prince Andrew,<br>trying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face remained<br>before him with the force of reality and drew nearer. Prince Andrew<br>wished to return to that former world of pure thought, but he could not,<br>and delirium drew him back into its domain. The soft whispering voice<br>continued its rhythmic murmur, something oppressed him and stretched<br>out, and the strange face was before him. Prince Andrew collected all<br>his strength in an effort to recover his senses, he moved a little, and<br>suddenly there was a ringing in his ears, a dimness in his eyes, and<br>like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness. When he came to<br>himself, Natásha, that same living Natásha whom of all people he most<br>longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to<br>him, was kneeling before him. He realized that it was the real living<br>Natásha, and he was not surprised but quietly happy. Natásha, motionless<br>on her knees (she was unable to stir), with frightened eyes riveted on<br>him, was restraining her sobs. Her face was pale and rigid. Only in the<br>lower part of it something quivered.<br><br>Prince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.<br><br>“You?” he said. “How fortunate!”<br><br>With a rapid but careful movement Natásha drew nearer to him on her<br>knees and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over it and began<br>kissing it, just touching it lightly with her lips.<br><br>“Forgive me!” she whispered, raising her head and glancing at him.<br>“Forgive me!”<br><br>“I love you,” said Prince Andrew.<br><br>“Forgive...!”<br><br>“Forgive what?” he asked.<br><br>“Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!” faltered Natásha in a scarcely<br>audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more rapidly, just<br>touching it with her lips.<br><br>“I love you more, better than before,” said Prince Andrew, lifting her<br>face with his hand so as to look into her eyes.<br><br>Those eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly,<br>compassionately, and with joyous love. Natásha’s thin pale face, with<br>its swollen lips, was more than plain—it was dreadful. But Prince Andrew<br>did not see that, he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful. They<br>heard the sound of voices behind them.<br><br>Peter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor.<br>Timókhin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had<br>long been watching all that was going on, carefully covering his bare<br>body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench.<br><br>“What’s this?” said the doctor, rising from his bed. “Please go away,<br>madam!”<br><br>At that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her<br>daughter’s absence, knocked at the door.<br><br>Like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Natásha went out of the room<br>and, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed.<br><br>From that time, during all the rest of the Rostóvs’ journey, at every<br>halting place and wherever they spent a night, Natásha never left the<br>wounded Bolkónski, and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected<br>from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a<br>wounded man.<br><br>Dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew die<br>in her daughter’s arms during the journey—as, judging by what the doctor<br>said, it seemed might easily happen—she could not oppose Natásha. Though<br>with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and Natásha<br>the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement<br>would be renewed, no one—least of all Natásha and Prince Andrew—spoke of<br>this: the unsettled question of life and death, which hung not only over<br>Bolkónski but over all Russia, shut out all other considerations.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXIII<br><br>On the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was aching, the<br>clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on<br>his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful<br>he had done the day before. That something shameful was his yesterday’s<br>conversation with Captain Ramballe.<br><br>It was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors.<br>Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an engraved<br>stock which Gerásim had replaced on the writing table, he remembered<br>where he was and what lay before him that very day.<br><br>“Am I not too late?” he thought. “No, probably he won’t make his entry<br>into Moscow before noon.”<br><br>Pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him, but<br>hastened to act.<br><br>After arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to go out.<br>But it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could<br>not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets. It was difficult<br>to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat. He could not<br>carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm. Besides, it had been<br>discharged, and he had not had time to reload it. “No matter, the dagger<br>will do,” he said to himself, though when planning his design he had<br>more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the<br>student in 1809 had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But as<br>his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving<br>to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he<br>could to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a<br>green sheath which he had bought at the Súkharev market with the pistol,<br>and hid it under his waistcoat.<br><br>Having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head,<br>Pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or meeting<br>the captain, and passed out into the street.<br><br>The conflagration, at which he had looked with so much indifference the<br>evening before, had greatly increased during the night. Moscow was on<br>fire in several places. The buildings in Carriage Row, across the river,<br>in the Bazaar and the Povarskóy, as well as the barges on the Moskvá<br>River and the timber yards by the Dorogomílov Bridge, were all ablaze.<br><br>Pierre’s way led through side streets to the Povarskóy and from there<br>to the church of St. Nicholas on the Arbát, where he had long before<br>decided that the deed should be done. The gates of most of the houses<br>were locked and the shutters up. The streets and lanes were deserted.<br>The air was full of smoke and the smell of burning. Now and then he met<br>Russians with anxious and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air not of<br>the city but of the camp, walking in the middle of the streets. Both<br>the Russians and the French looked at Pierre with surprise. Besides his<br>height and stoutness, and the strange morose look of suffering in his<br>face and whole figure, the Russians stared at Pierre because they could<br>not make out to what class he could belong. The French followed him with<br>astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre, unlike all the<br>other Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity, paid no<br>attention to them. At the gate of one house three Frenchmen, who were<br>explaining something to some Russians who did not understand them,<br>stopped Pierre asking if he did not know French.<br><br>Pierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel<br>standing beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the shout<br>was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man’s musket as<br>he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side<br>of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around<br>him. He carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like<br>something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous night’s<br>experience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring<br>his mood safely to his destination. And even had he not been hindered by<br>anything on the way, his intention could not now have been carried out,<br>for Napoleon had passed the Arbát more than four hours previously on his<br>way from the Dorogomílov suburb to the Krémlin, and was now sitting in<br>a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the Krémlin, giving<br>detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately<br>to extinguish the fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the<br>inhabitants. But Pierre did not know this; he was entirely absorbed<br>in what lay before him, and was tortured—as those are who obstinately<br>undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its<br>difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures—by the<br>fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.<br><br>Though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct<br>and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the Povarskóy.<br><br>As Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser—he<br>even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose<br>from under the roofs of the houses. He met more people in the streets<br>and they were more excited. But Pierre, though he felt that something<br>unusual was happening around him, did not realize that he was<br>approaching the fire. As he was going along a footpath across a<br>wide-open space adjoining the Povarskóy on one side and the gardens<br>of Prince Gruzínski’s house on the other, Pierre suddenly heard the<br>desperate weeping of a woman close to him. He stopped as if awakening<br>from a dream and lifted his head.<br><br>By the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of household<br>goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and trunks. On the<br>ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer young, with long,<br>prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap. This woman,<br>swaying to and fro and muttering something, was choking with sobs. Two<br>girls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks,<br>were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale<br>frightened faces. The youngest child, a boy of about seven, who wore an<br>overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own, was crying in his<br>old nurse’s arms. A dirty, barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk,<br>and, having undone her pale-colored plait, was pulling it straight<br>and sniffing at her singed hair. The woman’s husband, a short,<br>round-shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official, with<br>sausage-shaped whiskers and showing under his square-set cap the hair<br>smoothly brushed forward over his temples, with expressionless face was<br>moving the trunks, which were placed one on another, and was dragging<br>some garments from under them.<br><br>As soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his feet.<br><br>“Dear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends... help<br>us, somebody,” she muttered between her sobs. “My girl... My daughter!<br>My youngest daughter is left behind. She’s burned! Ooh! Was it for this<br>I nursed you.... Ooh!”<br><br>“Don’t, Mary Nikoláevna!” said her husband to her in a low voice,<br>evidently only to justify himself before the stranger. “Sister must have<br>taken her, or else where can she be?” he added.<br><br>“Monster! Villain!” shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to weep.<br>“You have no heart, you don’t feel for your own child! Another man would<br>have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and neither a<br>man nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,” she went on,<br>addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. “The fire broke out<br>alongside, and blew our way, the maid called out ‘Fire!’ and we rushed<br>to collect our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is what we<br>have brought away.... The icons, and my dowry bed, all the rest is lost.<br>We seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!...” and again she<br>began to sob. “My child, my dear one! Burned, burned!”<br><br>“But where was she left?” asked Pierre.<br><br>From the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man<br>might help her.<br><br>“Oh, dear sir!” she cried, seizing him by the legs. “My benefactor, set<br>my heart at ease.... Aníska, go, you horrid girl, show him the way!” she<br>cried to the maid, angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing<br>her long teeth.<br><br>“Show me the way, show me, I... I’ll do it,” gasped Pierre rapidly.<br><br>The dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her plait,<br>sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre felt<br>as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon. He held his head<br>higher, his eyes shone with the light of life, and with swift steps<br>he followed the maid, overtook her, and came out on the Povarskóy. The<br>whole street was full of clouds of black smoke. Tongues of flame here<br>and there broke through that cloud. A great number of people crowded in<br>front of the conflagration. In the middle of the street stood a French<br>general saying something to those around him. Pierre, accompanied by the<br>maid, was advancing to the spot where the general stood, but the French<br>soldiers stopped him.<br><br>“On ne passe pas!” * cried a voice.<br><br>    * “You can’t pass!”<br><br><br>“This way, uncle,” cried the girl. “We’ll pass through the side street,<br>by the Nikúlins’!”<br><br>Pierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with her.<br>She ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left, and,<br>passing three houses, turned into a yard on the right.<br><br>“It’s here, close by,” said she and, running across the yard, opened a<br>gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small wooden<br>wing of the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely. One of its<br>sides had fallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames issued from<br>the openings of the windows and from under the roof.<br><br>As Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped by hot air and<br>involuntarily stopped.<br><br>“Which is it? Which is your house?” he asked.<br><br>“Ooh!” wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. “That’s it, that was our<br>lodging. You’ve burned to death, our treasure, Katie, my precious little<br>missy! Ooh!” lamented Aníska, who at the sight of the fire felt that she<br>too must give expression to her feelings.<br><br>Pierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he<br>involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house<br>that was as yet burning only at one end, just below the roof, and around<br>which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not realize<br>what these men, who were dragging something out, were about; but seeing<br>before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying<br>to take from him a fox-fur coat, he vaguely understood that looting was<br>going on there, but he had no time to dwell on that idea.<br><br>The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings, the<br>whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the people, and<br>the sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick black clouds<br>and now soaring up with glittering sparks, with here and there dense<br>sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along<br>the walls), and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion, produced<br>on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration. It had a<br>peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt<br>himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down. He felt<br>young, bright, adroit, and resolute. He ran round to the other side of<br>the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still<br>standing, when just above his head he heard several voices shouting<br>and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close<br>beside him.<br><br>Pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some Frenchmen<br>who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with metal<br>articles. Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer.<br><br>“What does this fellow want?” shouted one of them referring to Pierre.<br><br>“There’s a child in that house. Haven’t you seen a child?” cried Pierre.<br><br>“What’s he talking about? Get along!” said several voices, and one of<br>the soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take from<br>them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved<br>threateningly toward him.<br><br>“A child?” shouted a Frenchman from above. “I did hear something<br>squealing in the garden. Perhaps it’s his brat that the fellow is<br>looking for. After all, one must be human, you know....”<br><br>“Where is it? Where?” said Pierre.<br><br>“There! There!” shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the<br>garden at the back of the house. “Wait a bit—I’m coming down.”<br><br>And a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with a spot<br>on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window on the<br>ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the<br>garden.<br><br>“Hurry up, you others!” he called out to his comrades. “It’s getting<br>hot.”<br><br>When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled<br>Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a<br>three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.<br><br>“There is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!” said the<br>Frenchman. “Good-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you<br>know!” and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his<br>comrades.<br><br>Breathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take<br>her in his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly, scrofulous-looking<br>child, unattractively like her mother, began to yell and run away.<br>Pierre, however, seized her and lifted her in his arms. She screamed<br>desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull Pierre’s<br>hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth. Pierre was seized<br>by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when<br>touching some nasty little animal. But he made an effort not to throw<br>the child down and ran with her to the large house. It was now, however,<br>impossible to get back the way he had come; the maid, Aníska, was no<br>longer there, and Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the<br>wet, painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran<br>with her through the garden seeking another way out.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XXXIV<br><br>Having run through different yards and side streets, Pierre got back<br>with his little burden to the Gruzínski garden at the corner of the<br>Povarskóy. He did not at first recognize the place from which he had set<br>out to look for the child, so crowded was it now with people and goods<br>that had been dragged out of the houses. Besides Russian families who<br>had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings, there were<br>several French soldiers in a variety of clothing. Pierre took no notice<br>of them. He hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to<br>restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else. Pierre<br>felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly. Glowing with the<br>heat and from running, he felt at that moment more strongly than ever<br>the sense of youth, animation, and determination that had come on him<br>when he ran to save the child. She had now become quiet and, clinging<br>with her little hands to Pierre’s coat, sat on his arm gazing about<br>her like some little wild animal. He glanced at her occasionally with a<br>slight smile. He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that<br>frightened, sickly little face.<br><br>He did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them. He<br>walked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning the various faces he<br>met. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family<br>consisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental type, wearing a new,<br>cloth-covered, sheepskin coat and new boots, an old woman of similar<br>type, and a young woman. That very young woman seemed to Pierre the<br>perfection of Oriental beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched,<br>black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft, bright color of her long,<br>beautiful, expressionless face. Amid the scattered property and the<br>crowd on the open space, she, in her rich satin cloak with a bright<br>lilac shawl on her head, suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out<br>onto the snow. She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old<br>woman, and looked from under her long lashes with motionless, large,<br>almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her. Evidently she was aware<br>of her beauty and fearful because of it. Her face struck Pierre and,<br>hurrying along by the fence, he turned several times to look at her.<br>When he had reached the fence, still without finding those he sought, he<br>stopped and looked about him.<br><br>With the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than<br>before, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered about him.<br><br>“Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow? You’re of the gentry yourself,<br>aren’t you? Whose child is it?” they asked him.<br><br>Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who<br>had been sitting there with her other children, and he asked whether<br>anyone knew where she had gone.<br><br>“Why, that must be the Anférovs,” said an old deacon, addressing a<br>pockmarked peasant woman. “Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy!” he added<br>in his customary bass.<br><br>“The Anférovs? No,” said the woman. “They left in the morning. That must<br>be either Mary Nikoláevna’s or the Ivánovs’!”<br><br>“He says ‘a woman,’ and Mary Nikoláevna is a lady,” remarked a house<br>serf.<br><br>“Do you know her? She’s thin, with long teeth,” said Pierre.<br><br>“That’s Mary Nikoláevna! They went inside the garden when these wolves<br>swooped down,” said the woman, pointing to the French soldiers.<br><br>“O Lord, have mercy!” added the deacon.<br><br>“Go over that way, they’re there. It’s she! She kept on lamenting and<br>crying,” continued the woman. “It’s she. Here, this way!”<br><br>But Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some seconds been<br>intently watching what was going on a few steps away. He was looking at<br>the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them.<br>One of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat tied round<br>the waist with a rope. He had a nightcap on his head and his feet were<br>bare. The other, whose appearance particularly struck Pierre, was a<br>long, lank, round-shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in his movements<br>and with an idiotic expression of face. He wore a woman’s loose gown<br>of frieze, blue trousers, and large torn Hessian boots. The little<br>barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and,<br>saying something, immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old<br>man at once began pulling off his boots. The other in the frieze gown<br>stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and with his hands in<br>his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and silent.<br><br>“Here, take the child!” said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the<br>woman, handing the little girl to her. “Give her back to them, give her<br>back!” he almost shouted, putting the child, who began screaming, on the<br>ground, and again looking at the Frenchman and the Armenian family.<br><br>The old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman had<br>secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other.<br>The old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre<br>caught but a glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to the<br>Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from side to<br>side, had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his<br>pockets had seized her by the neck.<br><br>The beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude,<br>with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the<br>soldier was doing to her.<br><br>While Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the<br>Frenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing<br>from her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, and the young<br>woman, clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.<br><br>“Let that woman alone!” exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious voice,<br>seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside.<br><br>The soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing down<br>the boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward Pierre.<br><br>“Voyons, pas de bêtises!” * he cried.<br><br>    * “Look here, no nonsense!”<br><br><br>Pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and<br>his strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted Frenchman<br>and, before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked him off his<br>feet and hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval were heard<br>from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French<br>Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to<br>Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre remembered nothing<br>of what happened after that. He only remembered beating someone and<br>being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a<br>crowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him.<br><br>“Lieutenant, he has a dagger,” were the first words Pierre understood.<br><br>“Ah, a weapon?” said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier<br>who had been arrested with Pierre. “All right, you can tell all about it<br>at the court-martial.” Then he turned to Pierre. “Do you speak French?”<br><br>Pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. His<br>face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in<br>a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on<br>both sides of Pierre.<br><br>“Do you speak French?” the officer asked again, keeping at a distance<br>from Pierre. “Call the interpreter.”<br><br>A little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks, and<br>by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a<br>French salesman from one of the Moscow shops.<br><br>“He does not look like a common man,” said the interpreter, after a<br>searching look at Pierre.<br><br>“Ah, he looks very much like an incendiary,” remarked the officer. “And<br>ask him who he is,” he added.<br><br>“Who are you?” asked the interpreter in poor Russian. “You must answer<br>the chief.”<br><br>“I will not tell you who I am. I am your prisoner—take me!” Pierre<br>suddenly replied in French.<br><br>“Ah, ah!” muttered the officer with a frown. “Well then, march!”<br><br>A crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood the<br>pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol<br>started she moved forward.<br><br>“Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?” said she. “And the little<br>girl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if she’s not theirs?”<br>said the woman.<br><br>“What does that woman want?” asked the officer.<br><br>Pierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the sight of the<br>little girl he had saved.<br><br>“What does she want?” he murmured. “She is bringing me my daughter whom<br>I have just saved from the flames,” said he. “Good-by!” And without<br>knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him, he went along with<br>resolute and triumphant steps between the French soldiers.<br><br>The French patrol was one of those sent out through the various<br>streets of Moscow by Durosnel’s order to put a stop to the pillage,<br>and especially to catch the incendiaries who, according to the general<br>opinion which had that day originated among the higher French officers,<br>were the cause of the conflagrations. After marching through a number<br>of streets the patrol arrested five more Russian suspects: a small<br>shopkeeper, two seminary students, a peasant, and a house serf, besides<br>several looters. But of all these various suspected characters, Pierre<br>was considered to be the most suspicious of all. When they had all been<br>brought for the night to a large house on the Zúbov Rampart that was<br>being used as a guardhouse, Pierre was placed apart under strict guard.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK TWELVE: 1812<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>In Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on<br>with greater heat than ever in the highest circles, between the parties<br>of Rumyántsev, the French, Márya Fëdorovna, the Tsarévich, and others,<br>drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones. But the calm,<br>luxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about phantoms and<br>reflections of real life, went on in its old way and made it hard,<br>except by a great effort, to realize the danger and the difficult<br>position of the Russian people. There were the same receptions and<br>balls, the same French theater, the same court interests and service<br>interests and intrigues as usual. Only in the very highest circles were<br>attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position.<br>Stories were whispered of how differently the two Empresses behaved<br>in these difficult circumstances. The Empress Márya, concerned for<br>the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her<br>patronage, had given directions that they should all be removed to<br>Kazán, and the things belonging to these institutions had already been<br>packed up. The Empress Elisabeth, however, when asked what instructions<br>she would be pleased to give—with her characteristic Russian patriotism<br>had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions<br>for that was the affair of the sovereign, but as far as she personally<br>was concerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg.<br><br>At Anna Pávlovna’s on the twenty-sixth of August, the very day of the<br>battle of Borodinó, there was a soiree, the chief feature of which was<br>to be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when sending<br>the Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was regarded as a model<br>of ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. Prince Vasíli himself, famed for<br>his elocution, was to read it. (He used to read at the Empress’.) The<br>art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words, quite<br>independently of their meaning, in a loud and singsong voice alternating<br>between a despairing wail and a tender murmur, so that the wail fell<br>quite at random on one word and the murmur on another. This reading,<br>as was always the case at Anna Pávlovna’s soirees, had a political<br>significance. That evening she expected several important personages who<br>had to be made ashamed of their visits to the French theater and aroused<br>to a patriotic temper. A good many people had already arrived, but Anna<br>Pávlovna, not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room,<br>did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general<br>conversation.<br><br>The news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess Bezúkhova.<br>She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously, had missed<br>several gatherings of which she was usually the ornament, and was said<br>to be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors<br>who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor<br>who was treating her in some new and unusual way.<br><br>They all knew very well that the enchanting countess’ illness arose from<br>an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time,<br>and that the Italian’s cure consisted in removing such inconvenience;<br>but in Anna Pávlovna’s presence no one dared to think of this or even<br>appear to know it.<br><br>“They say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is angina<br>pectoris.”<br><br>“Angina? Oh, that’s a terrible illness!”<br><br>“They say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina...” and<br>the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.<br><br>“The count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the doctor<br>told him the case was dangerous.”<br><br>“Oh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman.”<br><br>“You are speaking of the poor countess?” said Anna Pávlovna, coming<br>up just then. “I sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a little<br>better. Oh, she is certainly the most charming woman in the world,” she<br>went on, with a smile at her own enthusiasm. “We belong to different<br>camps, but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves. She<br>is very unfortunate!” added Anna Pávlovna.<br><br>Supposing that by these words Anna Pávlovna was somewhat lifting the<br>veil from the secret of the countess’ malady, an unwary young man<br>ventured to express surprise that well-known doctors had not been called<br>in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might<br>employ dangerous remedies.<br><br>“Your information may be better than mine,” Anna Pávlovna suddenly and<br>venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man, “but I know on good<br>authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man. He is private<br>physician to the Queen of Spain.”<br><br>And having thus demolished the young man, Anna Pávlovna turned to<br>another group where Bilíbin was talking about the Austrians: having<br>wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again<br>and utter one of his mots.<br><br>“I think it is delightful,” he said, referring to a diplomatic note that<br>had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners captured from the<br>French by Wittgenstein, “the hero of Petropol” as he was then called in<br>Petersburg.<br><br>“What? What’s that?” asked Anna Pávlovna, securing silence for the mot,<br>which she had heard before.<br><br>And Bilíbin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch, which<br>he had himself composed.<br><br>“The Emperor returns these Austrian banners,” said Bilíbin, “friendly<br>banners gone astray and found on a wrong path,” and his brow became<br>smooth again.<br><br>“Charming, charming!” observed Prince Vasíli.<br><br>“The path to Warsaw, perhaps,” Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly and<br>unexpectedly. Everybody looked at him, understanding what he meant.<br>Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise. He knew no<br>more than the others what his words meant. During his diplomatic career<br>he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very<br>witty, and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words<br>that entered his head. “It may turn out very well,” he thought, “but<br>if not, they’ll know how to arrange matters.” And really, during the<br>awkward silence that ensued, that insufficiently patriotic person<br>entered whom Anna Pávlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert,<br>and she, smiling and shaking a finger at Hippolyte, invited Prince<br>Vasíli to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript<br>begged him to begin. Everyone became silent.<br><br>“Most Gracious Sovereign and Emperor!” Prince Vasíli sternly declaimed,<br>looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had<br>anything to say to the contrary. But no one said anything. “Moscow, our<br>ancient capital, the New Jerusalem, receives her Christ”—he placed a<br>sudden emphasis on the word her—“as a mother receives her zealous sons<br>into her arms, and through the gathering mists, foreseeing the brilliant<br>glory of thy rule, sings in exultation, ‘Hosanna, blessed is he that<br>cometh!’”<br><br>Prince Vasíli pronounced these last words in a tearful voice.<br><br>Bilíbin attentively examined his nails, and many of those present<br>appeared intimidated, as if asking in what they were to blame. Anna<br>Pávlovna whispered the next words in advance, like an old woman<br>muttering the prayer at Communion: “Let the bold and insolent<br>Goliath...” she whispered.<br><br>Prince Vasíli continued.<br><br>“Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France encompass<br>the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; humble Faith, the sling<br>of the Russian David, shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty<br>pride. This icon of the Venerable Sergius, the servant of God and<br>zealous champion of old of our country’s weal, is offered to Your<br>Imperial Majesty. I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing<br>in the sight of your most gracious presence. I raise fervent prayers to<br>Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race of the just, and mercifully<br>fulfill the desires of Your Majesty.”<br><br>“What force! What a style!” was uttered in approval both of reader and<br>of author.<br><br>Animated by that address Anna Pávlovna’s guests talked for a long time<br>of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the<br>result of the battle to be fought in a few days.<br><br>“You will see,” said Anna Pávlovna, “that tomorrow, on the Emperor’s<br>birthday, we shall receive news. I have a favorable presentiment!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>Anna Pávlovna’s presentiment was in fact fulfilled. Next day during the<br>service at the palace church in honor of the Emperor’s birthday, Prince<br>Volkónski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from<br>Prince Kutúzov. It was Kutúzov’s report, written from Tatárinova on the<br>day of the battle. Kutúzov wrote that the Russians had not retreated a<br>step, that the French losses were much heavier than ours, and that he<br>was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full<br>information. It followed that there must have been a victory. And at<br>once, without leaving the church, thanks were rendered to the Creator<br>for His help and for the victory.<br><br>Anna Pávlovna’s presentiment was justified, and all that morning a<br>joyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed the victory<br>to have been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleon’s having been<br>captured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new ruler for<br>France.<br><br>It is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength<br>and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the<br>scene of action. General events involuntarily group themselves around<br>some particular incident. So now the courtiers’ pleasure was based as<br>much on the fact that the news had arrived on the Emperor’s birthday as<br>on the fact of the victory itself. It was like a successfully arranged<br>surprise. Mention was made in Kutúzov’s report of the Russian losses,<br>among which figured the names of Túchkov, Bagratión, and Kutáysov. In<br>the Petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily<br>centered round a single incident: Kutáysov’s death. Everybody knew<br>him, the Emperor liked him, and he was young and interesting. That day<br>everyone met with the words:<br><br>“What a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. But what a loss<br>Kutáysov is! How sorry I am!”<br><br>“What did I tell about Kutúzov?” Prince Vasíli now said with a<br>prophet’s pride. “I always said he was the only man capable of defeating<br>Napoleon.”<br><br>But next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew<br>anxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense<br>occasioned the Emperor.<br><br>“Fancy the Emperor’s position!” said they, and instead of extolling<br>Kutúzov as they had done the day before, they condemned him as the cause<br>of the Emperor’s anxiety. That day Prince Vasíli no longer boasted of<br>his protégé Kutúzov, but remained silent when the commander in chief was<br>mentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if everything conspired to make<br>Petersburg society anxious and uneasy, a terrible piece of news was<br>added. Countess Hélène Bezúkhova had suddenly died of that terrible<br>malady it had been so agreeable to mention. Officially, at large<br>gatherings, everyone said that Countess Bezúkhova had died of a<br>terrible attack of angina pectoris, but in intimate circles details<br>were mentioned of how the private physician of the Queen of Spain had<br>prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect;<br>but Hélène, tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and<br>that her husband to whom she had written (that wretched, profligate<br>Pierre) had not replied, had suddenly taken a very large dose of the<br>drug, and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her.<br>It was said that Prince Vasíli and the old count had turned upon the<br>Italian, but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate<br>deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop.<br><br>Talk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperor’s<br>lack of news, the loss of Kutáysov, and the death of Hélène.<br><br>On the third day after Kutúzov’s report a country gentleman arrived from<br>Moscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French spread through<br>the whole town. This was terrible! What a position for the Emperor to<br>be in! Kutúzov was a traitor, and Prince Vasíli during the visits of<br>condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughter’s death said of<br>Kutúzov, whom he had formerly praised (it was excusable for him in his<br>grief to forget what he had said), that it was impossible to expect<br>anything else from a blind and depraved old man.<br><br>“I only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such<br>a man.”<br><br>As long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it,<br>but the next day the following communication was received from Count<br>Rostopchín:<br><br>Prince Kutúzov’s adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands<br>police officers to guide the army to the Ryazán road. He writes that<br>he is regretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! Kutúzov’s action decides the<br>fate of the capital and of your empire! Russia will shudder to learn of<br>the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in<br>which lie the ashes of your ancestors! I shall follow the army. I have<br>had everything removed, and it only remains for me to weep over the fate<br>of my fatherland.<br><br>On receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volkónski to Kutúzov<br>with the following rescript:<br><br>Prince Michael Ilariónovich! Since the twenty-ninth of August I have<br>received no communication from you, yet on the first of September I<br>received from the commander in chief of Moscow, via Yaroslávl, the sad<br>news that you, with the army, have decided to abandon Moscow. You can<br>yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me, and your silence<br>increases my astonishment. I am sending this by Adjutant-General Prince<br>Volkónski, to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons<br>that have induced you to take this melancholy decision.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>Nine days after the abandonment of Moscow, a messenger from Kutúzov<br>reached Petersburg with the official announcement of that event. This<br>messenger was Michaud, a Frenchman who did not know Russian, but who was<br>quoique étranger, russe de cœur et d’âme, * as he said of himself.<br><br>    * Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul.<br><br>The Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace<br>on Stone Island. Michaud, who had never seen Moscow before the campaign<br>and who did not know Russian, yet felt deeply moved (as he wrote) when<br>he appeared before notre très gracieux souverain * with the news of the<br>burning of Moscow, dont les flammes éclairaient sa route. *(2)<br><br>     * Our most gracious sovereign.<br><br>     * (2) Whose flames illumined his route.<br><br>Though the source of M. Michaud’s chagrin must have been different from<br>that which caused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad face when shown<br>into the Emperor’s study that the latter at once asked:<br><br>“Have you brought me sad news, Colonel?”<br><br>“Very sad, sire,” replied Michaud, lowering his eyes with a sigh. “The<br>abandonment of Moscow.”<br><br>“Have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle?” asked the<br>Emperor quickly, his face suddenly flushing.<br><br>Michaud respectfully delivered the message Kutúzov had entrusted to him,<br>which was that it had been impossible to fight before Moscow, and that<br>as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as<br>Moscow, or losing Moscow alone, the field marshal had to choose the<br>latter.<br><br>The Emperor listened in silence, not looking at Michaud.<br><br>“Has the enemy entered the city?” he asked.<br><br>“Yes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes. I left it all in flames,”<br>replied Michaud in a decided tone, but glancing at the Emperor he was<br>frightened by what he had done.<br><br>The Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower lip<br>trembled, and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes.<br><br>But this lasted only a moment. He suddenly frowned, as if blaming<br>himself for his weakness, and raising his head addressed Michaud in a<br>firm voice:<br><br>“I see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence requires<br>great sacrifices of us... I am ready to submit myself in all things to<br>His will; but tell me, Michaud, how did you leave the army when it<br>saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle? Did you not notice<br>discouragement?...”<br><br>Seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more, Michaud also<br>grew calm, but was not immediately ready to reply to the Emperor’s<br>direct and relevant question which required a direct answer.<br><br>“Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?” he<br>asked to gain time.<br><br>“Colonel, I always require it,” replied the Emperor. “Conceal nothing<br>from me, I wish to know absolutely how things are.”<br><br>“Sire!” said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely perceptible smile on his<br>lips, having now prepared a well-phrased reply, “sire, I left the<br>whole army, from its chiefs to the lowest soldier, without exception in<br>desperate and agonized terror...”<br><br>“How is that?” the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly. “Would<br>misfortune make my Russians lose heart?... Never!”<br><br>Michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had<br>prepared.<br><br>“Sire,” he said, with respectful playfulness, “they are only afraid lest<br>Your Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should allow yourself to be<br>persuaded to make peace. They are burning for the combat,” declared this<br>representative of the Russian nation, “and to prove to Your Majesty by<br>the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are....”<br><br>“Ah!” said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly gleam in his eyes,<br>he patted Michaud on the shoulder. “You set me at ease, Colonel.”<br><br>He bent his head and was silent for some time.<br><br>“Well, then, go back to the army,” he said, drawing himself up to his<br>full height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture,<br>“and tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that<br>when I have not a soldier left I shall put myself at the head of my<br>beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of<br>my empire. It still offers me more than my enemies suppose,” said the<br>Emperor growing more and more animated; “but should it ever be ordained<br>by Divine Providence,” he continued, raising to heaven his fine eyes<br>shining with emotion, “that my dynasty should cease to reign on the<br>throne of my ancestors, then after exhausting all the means at my<br>command, I shall let my beard grow to here” (he pointed halfway down his<br>chest) “and go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants, rather<br>than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose<br>sacrifices I know how to appreciate.”<br><br>Having uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor suddenly<br>turned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his eyes,<br>and went to the further end of his study. Having stood there a few<br>moments, he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow<br>with a vigorous movement. The Emperor’s mild and handsome face was<br>flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger.<br><br>“Colonel Michaud, do not forget what I say to you here, perhaps we may<br>recall it with pleasure someday... Napoleon or I,” said the Emperor,<br>touching his breast. “We can no longer both reign together. I have<br>learned to know him, and he will not deceive me any more....”<br><br>And the Emperor paused, with a frown.<br><br>When he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in<br>the Emperor’s eyes, Michaud—quoique étranger, russe de cœur et d’âme,—at<br>that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard (as<br>he used afterwards to say), and gave expression to his own feelings and<br>those of the Russian people whose representative he considered himself<br>to be, in the following words:<br><br>“Sire!” said he, “Your Majesty is at this moment signing the glory of<br>the nation and the salvation of Europe!”<br><br>With an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>It is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that<br>when half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to<br>distant provinces, and one levy after another was being raised for the<br>defense of the fatherland, all Russians from the greatest to the least<br>were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves, saving their fatherland,<br>or weeping over its downfall. The tales and descriptions of that time<br>without exception speak only of the self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion,<br>despair, grief, and the heroism of the Russians. But it was not really<br>so. It appears so to us because we see only the general historic<br>interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests<br>that people had. Yet in reality those personal interests of the moment<br>so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the<br>public interest from being felt or even noticed. Most of the people at<br>that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were<br>guided only by their private interests, and they were the very people<br>whose activities at that period were most useful.<br><br>Those who tried to understand the general course of events and to take<br>part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members<br>of society, they saw everything upside down, and all they did for the<br>common good turned out to be useless and foolish—like Pierre’s and<br>Mamónov’s regiments which looted Russian villages, and the lint the<br>young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded, and so on.<br>Even those, fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings,<br>who discussed Russia’s position at the time involuntarily introduced<br>into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or<br>useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of<br>actions no one could possibly be guilty of. In historic events the rule<br>forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is specially<br>applicable. Only unconscious action bears fruit, and he who plays a part<br>in an historic event never understands its significance. If he tries to<br>realize it his efforts are fruitless.<br><br>The more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in<br>Russia the less did he realize their significance. In Petersburg and<br>in the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and gentlemen in<br>militia uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital and talked of<br>self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which retired beyond Moscow<br>there was little talk or thought of Moscow, and when they caught sight<br>of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the French, but they<br>thought about their next pay, their next quarters, of Matrëshka the<br>vivandière, and like matters.<br><br>As the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas Rostóv took a close<br>and prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so casually,<br>without any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked at what was<br>going on in Russia without despair and without dismally racking his<br>brains over it. Had he been asked what he thought of the state of<br>Russia, he would have said that it was not his business to think about<br>it, that Kutúzov and others were there for that purpose, but that he had<br>heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength, that<br>fighting would probably go on for a long time yet, and that things being<br>so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple<br>of years’ time.<br><br>As he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he was being<br>sent to Vorónezh to buy remounts for his division, not only without<br>regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle, but<br>with the greatest pleasure—which he did not conceal and which his<br>comrades fully understood.<br><br>A few days before the battle of Borodinó, Nicholas received the<br>necessary money and warrants, and having sent some hussars on in<br>advance, he set out with post horses for Vorónezh.<br><br>Only a man who has experienced it—that is, has passed some months<br>continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war—can understand the<br>delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the<br>army’s foraging operations, provision trains, and hospitals. When—free<br>from soldiers, wagons, and the filthy traces of a camp—he saw villages<br>with peasants and peasant women, gentlemen’s country houses, fields<br>where cattle were grazing, posthouses with stationmasters asleep in<br>them, he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time. What for<br>a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women, young<br>and healthy, without a dozen officers making up to each of them; women,<br>too, who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke<br>with them.<br><br>In the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in Vorónezh,<br>ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp, and next day, very<br>clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not worn for a long<br>time, went to present himself to the authorities.<br><br>The commander of the militia was a civilian general, an old man who was<br>evidently pleased with his military designation and rank. He received<br>Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically military)<br>and questioned him with an important air, as if considering the general<br>progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do<br>so. Nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him.<br><br>From the commander of the militia he drove to the governor. The governor<br>was a brisk little man, very simple and affable. He indicated the stud<br>farms at which Nicholas might procure horses, recommended to him a horse<br>dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had<br>the best horses, and promised to assist him in every way.<br><br>“You are Count Ilyá Rostóv’s son? My wife was a great friend of your<br>mother’s. We are at home on Thursdays—today is Thursday, so please come<br>and see us quite informally,” said the governor, taking leave of him.<br><br>Immediately on leaving the governor’s, Nicholas hired post horses and,<br>taking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop to the<br>landowner, fourteen miles away, who had the stud. Everything seemed to<br>him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in Vorónezh<br>and, as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind,<br>everything went well and easily.<br><br>The landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old cavalryman, a<br>horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some century-old brandy<br>and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery where he smoked, and who<br>owned some splendid horses.<br><br>In very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six<br>thousand rubles—to serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts. After<br>dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine, Nicholas—having<br>exchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom he was already on the<br>friendliest terms—galloped back over abominable roads, in the brightest<br>frame of mind, continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for<br>the governor’s party.<br><br>When he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented himself,<br>Nicholas arrived at the governor’s rather late, but with the phrase<br>“better late than never” on his lips.<br><br>It was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone knew<br>that Catherine Petróvna would play valses and the écossaise on the<br>clavichord and that there would be dancing, and so everyone had come as<br>to a ball.<br><br>Provincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this<br>difference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the<br>arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in everything that<br>went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable, an<br>“in for a penny, in for a pound—who cares?” spirit, and the inevitable<br>small talk, instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances,<br>now turned on Moscow, the army, and Napoleon.<br><br>The society gathered together at the governor’s was the best in<br>Vorónezh.<br><br>There were a great many ladies and some of Nicholas’ Moscow<br>acquaintances, but there were no men who could at all vie with the<br>cavalier of St. George, the hussar remount officer, the good-natured<br>and well-bred Count Rostóv. Among the men was an Italian prisoner, an<br>officer of the French army; and Nicholas felt that the presence of that<br>prisoner enhanced his own importance as a Russian hero. The Italian<br>was, as it were, a war trophy. Nicholas felt this, it seemed to him<br>that everyone regarded the Italian in the same light, and he treated him<br>cordially though with dignity and restraint.<br><br>As soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing around him<br>a fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the words “better late<br>than never” and heard them repeated several times by others, people<br>clustered around him; all eyes turned on him, and he felt at once<br>that he had entered into his proper position in the province—that of<br>a universal favorite: a very pleasant position, and intoxicatingly so<br>after his long privations. At posting stations, at inns, and in the<br>landowner’s snuggery, maidservants had been flattered by his notice, and<br>here too at the governor’s party there were (as it seemed to Nicholas)<br>an inexhaustible number of pretty young women, married and unmarried,<br>impatiently awaiting his notice. The women and girls flirted with him<br>and, from the first day, the people concerned themselves to get this<br>fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down. Among these<br>was the governor’s wife herself, who welcomed Rostóv as a near relative<br>and called him “Nicholas.”<br><br>Catherine Petróvna did actually play valses and the écossaise, and<br>dancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the provincial<br>society by his agility. His particularly free manner of dancing even<br>surprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he<br>danced that evening. He had never danced like that in Moscow and would<br>even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in<br>bad form, but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by<br>something unusual, something they would have to accept as the regular<br>thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces.<br><br>All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and<br>pleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials.<br>With the naïve conviction of young men in a merry mood that other men’s<br>wives were created for them, Rostóv did not leave the lady’s side and<br>treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style, as if,<br>without speaking of it, they knew how capitally Nicholas and the lady<br>would get on together. The husband, however, did not seem to share that<br>conviction and tried to behave morosely with Rostóv. But the<br>latter’s good-natured naïveté was so boundless that sometimes even he<br>involuntarily yielded to Nicholas’ good humor. Toward the end of the<br>evening, however, as the wife’s face grew more flushed and animated, the<br>husband’s became more and more melancholy and solemn, as though there<br>were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wife’s<br>share increased the husband’s diminished.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>Nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair, bending closely<br>over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a<br>smile that never left his face. Jauntily shifting the position of his<br>legs in their tight riding breeches, diffusing an odor of perfume, and<br>admiring his partner, himself, and the fine outlines of his legs in<br>their well-fitting Hessian boots, Nicholas told the blonde lady that he<br>wished to run away with a certain lady here in Vorónezh.<br><br>“Which lady?”<br><br>“A charming lady, a divine one. Her eyes” (Nicholas looked at his<br>partner) “are blue, her mouth coral and ivory; her figure” (he glanced<br>at her shoulders) “like Diana’s....”<br><br>The husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking<br>about.<br><br>“Ah, Nikíta Iványch!” cried Nicholas, rising politely, and as if wishing<br>Nikíta Iványch to share his joke, he began to tell him of his intention<br>to elope with a blonde lady.<br><br>The husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. The governor’s good-natured<br>wife came up with a look of disapproval.<br><br>“Anna Ignátyevna wants to see you, Nicholas,” said she, pronouncing the<br>name so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna Ignátyevna was a very<br>important person. “Come, Nicholas! You know you let me call you so?”<br><br>“Oh, yes, Aunt. Who is she?”<br><br>“Anna Ignátyevna Malvíntseva. She has heard from her niece how you<br>rescued her.... Can you guess?”<br><br>“I rescued such a lot of them!” said Nicholas.<br><br>“Her niece, Princess Bolkónskaya. She is here in Vorónezh with her aunt.<br>Oho! How you blush. Why, are...?”<br><br>“Not a bit! Please don’t, Aunt!”<br><br>“Very well, very well!... Oh, what a fellow you are!”<br><br>The governor’s wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with<br>a blue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with the most<br>important personages of the town. This was Malvíntseva, Princess Mary’s<br>aunt on her mother’s side, a rich, childless widow who always lived in<br>Vorónezh. When Rostóv approached her she was standing settling up for<br>the game. She looked at him and, screwing up her eyes sternly, continued<br>to upbraid the general who had won from her.<br><br>“Very pleased, mon cher,” she then said, holding out her hand to<br>Nicholas. “Pray come and see me.”<br><br>After a few words about Princess Mary and her late father, whom<br>Malvíntseva had evidently not liked, and having asked what Nicholas<br>knew of Prince Andrew, who also was evidently no favorite of hers, the<br>important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to<br>come to see her.<br><br>Nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the mention<br>of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear,<br>which he himself did not understand.<br><br>When he had parted from Malvíntseva Nicholas wished to return to the<br>dancing, but the governor’s little wife placed her plump hand on his<br>sleeve and, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to<br>her sitting room, from which those who were there immediately withdrew<br>so as not to be in her way.<br><br>“Do you know, dear boy,” began the governor’s wife with a serious<br>expression on her kind little face, “that really would be the match for<br>you: would you like me to arrange it?”<br><br>“Whom do you mean, Aunt?” asked Nicholas.<br><br>“I will make a match for you with the princess. Catherine Petróvna<br>speaks of Lily, but I say, no—the princess! Do you want me to do it? I<br>am sure your mother will be grateful to me. What a charming girl she is,<br>really! And she is not at all so plain, either.”<br><br>“Not at all,” replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea. “As befits<br>a soldier, Aunt, I don’t force myself on anyone or refuse anything,” he<br>said before he had time to consider what he was saying.<br><br>“Well then, remember, this is not a joke!”<br><br>“Of course not!”<br><br>“Yes, yes,” the governor’s wife said as if talking to herself. “But,<br>my dear boy, among other things you are too attentive to the other, the<br>blonde. One is sorry for the husband, really....”<br><br>“Oh no, we are good friends with him,” said Nicholas in the simplicity<br>of his heart; it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to<br>himself might not be pleasant to someone else.<br><br>“But what nonsense I have been saying to the governor’s wife!” thought<br>Nicholas suddenly at supper. “She will really begin to arrange a<br>match... and Sónya...?” And on taking leave of the governor’s wife,<br>when she again smilingly said to him, “Well then, remember!” he drew her<br>aside.<br><br>“But see here, to tell the truth, Aunt...”<br><br>“What is it, my dear? Come, let’s sit down here,” said she.<br><br>Nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate<br>thoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or<br>his friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger. When he afterwards<br>recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which<br>had very important results for him, it seemed to him—as it seems to<br>everyone in such cases—that it was merely some silly whim that seized<br>him: yet that burst of frankness, together with other trifling events,<br>had immense consequences for him and for all his family.<br><br>“You see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but the<br>very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.”<br><br>“Oh yes, I understand,” said the governor’s wife.<br><br>“But Princess Bolkónskaya—that’s another matter. I will tell you the<br>truth. In the first place I like her very much, I feel drawn to her; and<br>then, after I met her under such circumstances—so strangely, the idea<br>often occurred to me: ‘This is fate.’ Especially if you remember that<br>Mamma had long been thinking of it; but I had never happened to meet her<br>before, somehow it had always happened that we did not meet. And as long<br>as my sister Natásha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of<br>the question for me to think of marrying her. And it must needs happen<br>that I should meet her just when Natásha’s engagement had been broken<br>off... and then everything... So you see... I never told this to anyone<br>and never will, only to you.”<br><br>The governor’s wife pressed his elbow gratefully.<br><br>“You know Sónya, my cousin? I love her, and promised to marry her, and<br>will do so.... So you see there can be no question about—” said Nicholas<br>incoherently and blushing.<br><br>“My dear boy, what a way to look at it! You know Sónya has nothing and<br>you yourself say your Papa’s affairs are in a very bad way. And what<br>about your mother? It would kill her, that’s one thing. And what sort of<br>life would it be for Sónya—if she’s a girl with a heart? Your mother<br>in despair, and you all ruined.... No, my dear, you and Sónya ought to<br>understand that.”<br><br>Nicholas remained silent. It comforted him to hear these arguments.<br><br>“All the same, Aunt, it is impossible,” he rejoined with a sigh, after<br>a short pause. “Besides, would the princess have me? And besides, she is<br>now in mourning. How can one think of it!”<br><br>“But you don’t suppose I’m going to get you married at once? There is<br>always a right way of doing things,” replied the governor’s wife.<br><br>“What a matchmaker you are, Aunt...” said Nicholas, kissing her plump<br>little hand.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>On reaching Moscow after her meeting with Rostóv, Princess Mary had<br>found her nephew there with his tutor, and a letter from Prince Andrew<br>giving her instructions how to get to her Aunt Malvíntseva at Vorónezh.<br>That feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her<br>father’s illness, since his death, and especially since her meeting with<br>Rostóv was smothered by arrangements for the journey, anxiety about her<br>brother, settling in a new house, meeting new people, and attending to<br>her nephew’s education. She was sad. Now, after a month passed in quiet<br>surroundings, she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which<br>was associated in her mind with the ruin of Russia. She was agitated and<br>incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother,<br>the only intimate person now remaining to her, was exposed. She was<br>worried too about her nephew’s education for which she had always felt<br>herself incompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace—a<br>peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams<br>and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were<br>related to her meeting with Rostóv.<br><br>The day after her party the governor’s wife came to see Malvíntseva<br>and, after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked that though<br>under present circumstances a formal betrothal was, of course, not to be<br>thought of, all the same the young people might be brought together and<br>could get to know one another. Malvíntseva expressed approval, and the<br>governor’s wife began to speak of Rostóv in Mary’s presence, praising<br>him and telling how he had blushed when Princess Mary’s name was<br>mentioned. But Princess Mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful<br>feeling—her mental tranquillity was destroyed, and desires, doubts,<br>self-reproach, and hopes reawoke.<br><br>During the two days that elapsed before Rostóv called, Princess Mary<br>continually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First she decided<br>not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her aunt—that it<br>would not be proper for her, in her deep mourning, to receive visitors;<br>then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her; then<br>it occurred to her that her aunt and the governor’s wife had intentions<br>concerning herself and Rostóv—their looks and words at times seemed to<br>confirm this supposition—then she told herself that only she, with her<br>sinful nature, could think this of them: they could not forget that<br>situated as she was, while still wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking<br>would be an insult to her and to her father’s memory. Assuming that she<br>did go down to see him, Princess Mary imagined the words he would say<br>to her and what she would say to him, and these words sometimes seemed<br>undeservedly cold and then to mean too much. More than anything she<br>feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as<br>soon as she saw him.<br><br>But when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing<br>room that Count Rostóv had called, the princess showed no confusion,<br>only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new<br>and radiant light.<br><br>“You have met him, Aunt?” said she in a calm voice, unable herself to<br>understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural.<br><br>When Rostóv entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an<br>instant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then<br>just as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with<br>shining eyes. With a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose<br>with a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate hand to him,<br>and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep<br>womanly notes vibrated. Mademoiselle Bourienne, who was in the drawing<br>room, looked at Princess Mary in bewildered surprise. Herself a<br>consummate coquette, she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a<br>man she wished to attract.<br><br>“Either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly<br>improved without my having noticed it. And above all, what tact and<br>grace!” thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.<br><br>Had Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she would<br>have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the change that<br>had taken place in herself. From the moment she recognized that dear,<br>loved face, a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to<br>speak and act apart from her own will. From the time Rostóv entered, her<br>face became suddenly transformed. It was as if a light had been kindled<br>in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate, skillful, artistic<br>work on its sides, that previously seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless,<br>was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty. For the first<br>time all that pure, spiritual, inward travail through which she had<br>lived appeared on the surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction<br>with herself, her sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her<br>meekness, love, and self-sacrifice—all this now shone in those radiant<br>eyes, in her delicate smile, and in every trait of her gentle face.<br><br>Rostóv saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life. He<br>felt that the being before him was quite different from, and better<br>than, anyone he had met before, and above all better than himself.<br><br>Their conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of the<br>war, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow<br>about it; they spoke of their last meeting—Nicholas trying to change the<br>subject—they talked of the governor’s kind wife, of Nicholas’ relations,<br>and of Princess Mary’s.<br><br>She did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation as soon<br>as her aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of Russia’s<br>misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was too near<br>her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him. Nicholas<br>noticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess Mary’s character<br>with an observation unusual to him, and everything confirmed his<br>conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being.<br>Nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the<br>princess (as she did when he was mentioned) and even when he thought of<br>her, but in her presence he felt quite at ease, and said not at all what<br>he had prepared, but what, quite appropriately, occurred to him at the<br>moment.<br><br>When a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is usual when<br>there are children, turned to Prince Andrew’s little son, caressing him<br>and asking whether he would like to be an hussar. He took the boy on<br>his knee, played with him, and looked round at Princess Mary. With a<br>softened, happy, timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms<br>of the man she loved. Nicholas also noticed that look and, as if<br>understanding it, flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with<br>good natured playfulness.<br><br>As she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society, and<br>Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but all<br>the same the governor’s wife went on with her matchmaking, passing on to<br>Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and vice<br>versa, and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary. For this<br>purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishop’s<br>house before Mass.<br><br>Though Rostóv told the governor’s wife that he would not make any<br>declaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.<br><br>As at Tilsit Rostóv had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody<br>considered right was right, so now, after a short but sincere struggle<br>between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice, and<br>in obedient submission to circumstances, he chose the latter and yielded<br>to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where. He<br>knew that after his promise to Sónya it would be what he deemed base to<br>declare his feelings to Princess Mary. And he knew that he would never<br>act basely. But he also knew (or rather felt at the bottom of his heart)<br>that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those<br>who were guiding him, he was not only doing nothing wrong, but was doing<br>something very important—more important than anything he had ever done<br>in his life.<br><br>After meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life went on<br>externally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for him<br>and he often thought about her. But he never thought about her as he<br>had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met<br>in society, nor as he had for a long time, and at one time rapturously,<br>thought about Sónya. He had pictured each of those young ladies as<br>almost all honest-hearted young men do, that is, as a possible wife,<br>adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life:<br>a white dressing gown, his wife at the tea table, his wife’s carriage,<br>little ones, Mamma and Papa, their relations to her, and so on—and these<br>pictures of the future had given him pleasure. But with Princess Mary,<br>to whom they were trying to get him engaged, he could never picture<br>anything of future married life. If he tried, his pictures seemed<br>incongruous and false. It made him afraid.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>The dreadful news of the battle of Borodinó, of our losses in killed and<br>wounded, and the still more terrible news of the loss of Moscow reached<br>Vorónezh in the middle of September. Princess Mary, having learned of<br>her brother’s wound only from the Gazette and having no definite news of<br>him, prepared (so Nicholas heard, he had not seen her again himself) to<br>set off in search of Prince Andrew.<br><br>When he received the news of the battle of Borodinó and the abandonment<br>of Moscow, Rostóv was not seized with despair, anger, the desire for<br>vengeance, or any feeling of that kind, but everything in Vorónezh<br>suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome, and he experienced an<br>indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness. The conversations he heard<br>seemed to him insincere; he did not know how to judge all these affairs<br>and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear<br>to him. He made haste to finish buying the horses, and often became<br>unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster.<br><br>A few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which<br>Nicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian victory.<br>He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military<br>decorum through the service, meditating on a great variety of subjects.<br>When the service was over the governor’s wife beckoned him to her.<br><br>“Have you seen the princess?” she asked, indicating with a movement of<br>her head a lady standing on the opposite side, beyond the choir.<br><br>Nicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the profile<br>he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude, timidity, and<br>pity that immediately overcame him. Princess Mary, evidently engrossed<br>by her thoughts, was crossing herself for the last time before leaving<br>the church.<br><br>Nicholas looked at her face with surprise. It was the same face he had<br>seen before, there was the same general expression of refined, inner,<br>spiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up. There was a<br>pathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it. As had occurred<br>before when she was present, Nicholas went up to her without waiting to<br>be prompted by the governor’s wife and not asking himself whether or not<br>it was right and proper to address her here in church, and told her he<br>had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul. As soon as<br>she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face, lighting up both<br>her sorrow and her joy.<br><br>“There is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess,” said Rostóv. “It<br>is that if your brother, Prince Andrew Nikoláevich, were not living, it<br>would have been at once announced in the Gazette, as he is a colonel.”<br><br>The princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, but cheered<br>by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.<br><br>“And I have known so many cases of a splinter wound” (the Gazette said<br>it was a shell) “either proving fatal at once or being very slight,”<br>continued Nicholas. “We must hope for the best, and I am sure...”<br><br>Princess Mary interrupted him.<br><br>“Oh, that would be so dread...” she began and, prevented by agitation<br>from finishing, she bent her head with a movement as graceful as<br>everything she did in his presence and, looking up at him gratefully,<br>went out, following her aunt.<br><br>That evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle some<br>accounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished that business it<br>was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed,<br>and for a long time he paced up and down the room, reflecting on his<br>life, a thing he rarely did.<br><br>Princess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met<br>her in Smolénsk province. His having encountered her in such exceptional<br>circumstances, and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as<br>a good match, had drawn his particular attention to her. When he met her<br>again in Vorónezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing<br>but powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he<br>observed in her at this time. He was, however, preparing to go away and<br>it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself<br>of chances of meeting her. But that day’s encounter in church had, he<br>felt, sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale,<br>sad, refined face, that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures,<br>and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features<br>agitated him and evoked his sympathy. In men Rostóv could not bear to<br>see the expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not<br>like Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy<br>and dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed<br>the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible<br>attraction.<br><br>“She must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!” he said to himself.<br>“Why am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with Sónya?” And he<br>involuntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one and<br>the abundance of it in the other—a spirituality he himself lacked and<br>therefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would happen were<br>he free. How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife.<br>But no, he could not imagine that. He felt awed, and no clear picture<br>presented itself to his mind. He had long ago pictured to himself a<br>future with Sónya, and that was all clear and simple just because it<br>had all been thought out and he knew all there was in Sónya, but it was<br>impossible to picture a future with Princess Mary, because he did not<br>understand her but simply loved her.<br><br>Reveries about Sónya had had something merry and playful in them, but to<br>dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little frightening.<br><br>“How she prayed!” he thought. “It was plain that her whole soul was in<br>her prayer. Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains, and I am<br>sure her prayer will be answered. Why don’t I pray for what I want?” he<br>suddenly thought. “What do I want? To be free, released from Sónya...<br>She was right,” he thought, remembering what the governor’s wife had<br>said: “Nothing but misfortune can come of marrying Sónya. Muddles,<br>grief for Mamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible muddles!<br>Besides, I don’t love her—not as I should. O, God! release me from<br>this dreadful, inextricable position!” he suddenly began to pray. “Yes,<br>prayer can move mountains, but one must have faith and not pray as<br>Natásha and I used to as children, that the snow might turn into<br>sugar—and then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so. No,<br>but I am not praying for trifles now,” he thought as he put his pipe<br>down in a corner, and folding his hands placed himself before the icon.<br>Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to pray as he had not<br>done for a long time. Tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the<br>door opened and Lavrúshka came in with some papers.<br><br>“Blockhead! Why do you come in without being called?” cried Nicholas,<br>quickly changing his attitude.<br><br>“From the governor,” said Lavrúshka in a sleepy voice. “A courier has<br>arrived and there’s a letter for you.”<br><br>“Well, all right, thanks. You can go!”<br><br>Nicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother and<br>the other from Sónya. He recognized them by the handwriting and opened<br>Sónya’s first. He had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his<br>eyes opened wide with fear and joy.<br><br>“No, it’s not possible!” he cried aloud.<br><br>Unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and<br>reading it. He glanced through it, then read it again, and then again,<br>and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders,<br>stretching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed.<br>What he had just been praying for with confidence that God would hear<br>him had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much astonished as if it were<br>something extraordinary and unexpected, and as if the very fact that it<br>had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from God to whom he<br>had prayed, but by some ordinary coincidence.<br><br>This unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary letter<br>from Sónya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which<br>there had seemed no escape. She wrote that the last unfortunate<br>events—the loss of almost the whole of the Rostóvs’ Moscow property—and<br>the countess’ repeatedly expressed wish that Nicholas should marry<br>Princess Bolkónskaya, together with his silence and coldness of late,<br>had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and<br>set him completely free.<br><br>It would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of sorrow<br>or discord in the family that has been so good to me (she wrote), and my<br>love has no aim but the happiness of those I love; so, Nicholas, I<br>beg you to consider yourself free, and to be assured that, in spite of<br>everything, no one can love you more than does<br><br>Your Sónya<br><br>Both letters were written from Tróitsa. The other, from the countess,<br>described their last days in Moscow, their departure, the fire, and<br>the destruction of all their property. In this letter the countess also<br>mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded traveling with them;<br>his state was very critical, but the doctor said there was now more<br>hope. Sónya and Natásha were nursing him.<br><br>Next day Nicholas took his mother’s letter and went to see Princess<br>Mary. Neither he nor she said a word about what “Natásha nursing him”<br>might mean, but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly became almost as<br>intimate with the princess as if they were relations.<br><br>The following day he saw Princess Mary off on her journey to Yaroslávl,<br>and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>Sónya’s letter written from Tróitsa, which had come as an answer to<br>Nicholas’ prayer, was prompted by this: the thought of getting Nicholas<br>married to an heiress occupied the old countess’ mind more and more. She<br>knew that Sónya was the chief obstacle to this happening, and Sónya’s<br>life in the countess’ house had grown harder and harder, especially<br>after they had received a letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting<br>with Princess Mary in Boguchárovo. The countess let no occasion slip of<br>making humiliating or cruel allusions to Sónya.<br><br>But a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all that<br>was going on, she called Sónya to her and, instead of reproaching and<br>making demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself<br>and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her<br>engagement with Nicholas.<br><br>“I shall not be at peace till you promise me this.”<br><br>Sónya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that<br>she would do anything and was prepared for anything, but gave no actual<br>promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded<br>of her. She must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and<br>brought her up. To sacrifice herself for others was Sónya’s habit. Her<br>position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her<br>worth, and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it. But in all her<br>former acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they<br>raised her in her own esteem and in that of others, and so made her more<br>worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world. But<br>now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the<br>whole reward for her self-sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life.<br>And for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been<br>her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully; she felt jealous<br>of Natásha who had never experienced anything of this sort, had never<br>needed to sacrifice herself, but made others sacrifice themselves for<br>her and yet was beloved by everybody. And for the first time Sónya felt<br>that out of her pure, quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling<br>was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle, virtue,<br>or religion. Under the influence of this feeling Sónya, whose life of<br>dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive, having answered<br>the countess in vague general terms, avoided talking with her and<br>resolved to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him<br>free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.<br><br>The bustle and terror of the Rostóvs’ last days in Moscow stifled the<br>gloomy thoughts that oppressed Sónya. She was glad to find escape<br>from them in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince Andrew’s<br>presence in their house, despite her sincere pity for him and for<br>Natásha, she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that God<br>did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas. She knew that Natásha<br>loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love him. She<br>knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances<br>they would again fall in love with one another, and that Nicholas would<br>then not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would be within the<br>prohibited degrees of affinity. Despite all the terror of what had<br>happened during those last days and during the first days of their<br>journey, this feeling that Providence was intervening in her personal<br>affairs cheered Sónya.<br><br>At the Tróitsa monastery the Rostóvs first broke their journey for a<br>whole day.<br><br>Three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry, one<br>of which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was much better<br>that day and Natásha was sitting with him. In the next room sat the<br>count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was<br>calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery.<br>Sónya was there too, tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew and<br>Natásha were talking about. She heard the sound of their voices through<br>the door. That door opened and Natásha came out, looking excited. Not<br>noticing the monk, who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the<br>wide sleeve on his right arm, she went up to Sónya and took her hand.<br><br>“Natásha, what are you about? Come here!” said the countess.<br><br>Natásha went up to the monk for his blessing, and he advised her to pray<br>for aid to God and His saint.<br><br>As soon as the prior withdrew, Natásha took her friend by the hand and<br>went with her into the unoccupied room.<br><br>“Sónya, will he live?” she asked. “Sónya, how happy I am, and how<br>unhappy!... Sónya, dovey, everything is as it used to be. If only he<br>lives! He cannot... because... because... of...” and Natásha burst into<br>tears.<br><br>“Yes! I knew it! Thank God!” murmured Sónya. “He will live.”<br><br>Sónya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter’s fear and<br>grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one.<br>Sobbing, she kissed and comforted Natásha. “If only he lives!” she<br>thought. Having wept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the two<br>friends went together to Prince Andrew’s door. Natásha opened it<br>cautiously and glanced into the room, Sónya standing beside her at the<br>half-open door.<br><br>Prince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His pale face was<br>calm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular breathing.<br><br>“O, Natásha!” Sónya suddenly almost screamed, catching her companion’s<br>arm and stepping back from the door.<br><br>“What? What is it?” asked Natásha.<br><br>“It’s that, that...” said Sónya, with a white face and trembling lips.<br><br>Natásha softly closed the door and went with Sónya to the window, not<br>yet understanding what the latter was telling her.<br><br>“You remember,” said Sónya with a solemn and frightened expression.<br>“You remember when I looked in the mirror for you... at Otrádnoe at<br>Christmas? Do you remember what I saw?”<br><br>“Yes, yes!” cried Natásha opening her eyes wide, and vaguely recalling<br>that Sónya had told her something about Prince Andrew whom she had seen<br>lying down.<br><br>“You remember?” Sónya went on. “I saw it then and told everybody, you<br>and Dunyásha. I saw him lying on a bed,” said she, making a gesture with<br>her hand and a lifted finger at each detail, “and that he had his eyes<br>closed and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that his hands were<br>folded,” she concluded, convincing herself that the details she had just<br>seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror.<br><br>She had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that<br>came into her head, but what she had invented then seemed to her now<br>as real as any other recollection. She not only remembered what she had<br>then said—that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with<br>something red—but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said<br>that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed.<br><br>“Yes, yes, it really was pink!” cried Natásha, who now thought she<br>too remembered the word pink being used, and saw in this the most<br>extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction.<br><br>“But what does it mean?” she added meditatively.<br><br>“Oh, I don’t know, it is all so strange,” replied Sónya, clutching at<br>her head.<br><br>A few minutes later Prince Andrew rang and Natásha went to him, but<br>Sónya, feeling unusually excited and touched, remained at the window<br>thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred.<br><br><br>They had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army, and the<br>countess was writing to her son.<br><br>“Sónya!” said the countess, raising her eyes from her letter as her<br>niece passed, “Sónya, won’t you write to Nicholas?” She spoke in a soft,<br>tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles<br>Sónya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words. Those<br>eyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear of a refusal, and<br>readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal.<br><br>Sónya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand.<br><br>“Yes, Mamma, I will write,” said she.<br><br>Sónya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred that<br>day, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her<br>vision. Now that she knew that the renewal of Natásha’s relations with<br>Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying Princess Mary, she<br>was joyfully conscious of a return of that self-sacrificing spirit in<br>which she was accustomed to live and loved to live. So with a joyful<br>consciousness of performing a magnanimous deed—interrupted several times<br>by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes—she wrote that touching<br>letter the arrival of which had so amazed Nicholas.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>The officer and soldiers who had arrested Pierre treated him with<br>hostility but yet with respect, in the guardhouse to which he was taken.<br>In their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as<br>to who he might be—perhaps a very important person—and hostility as a<br>result of their recent personal conflict with him.<br><br>But when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for the<br>new guard—both officers and men—he was not as interesting as he had<br>been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not<br>recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person<br>who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had<br>uttered those solemn words about saving a child; they saw in him only<br>No. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and detained for some reason<br>by order of the Higher Command. If they noticed anything remarkable<br>about Pierre, it was only his unabashed, meditative concentration<br>and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke French, which struck them as<br>surprisingly good. In spite of this he was placed that day with the<br>other arrested suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was<br>required by an officer.<br><br>All the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class and,<br>recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more especially as<br>he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him.<br><br>That evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, among<br>them) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was taken<br>with the others to a house where a French general with a white mustache<br>sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on their arms.<br>With the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners,<br>and which is supposed to preclude human frailty, Pierre like the others<br>was questioned as to who he was, where he had been, with what object,<br>and so on.<br><br>These questions, like questions put at trials generally, left the<br>essence of the matter aside, shut out the possibility of that essence’s<br>being revealed, and were designed only to form a channel through which<br>the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to<br>the desired result, namely a conviction. As soon as Pierre began to say<br>anything that did not fit in with that aim, the channel was removed and<br>the water could flow to waste. Pierre felt, moreover, what the accused<br>always feel at their trial, perplexity as to why these questions were<br>put to him. He had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a<br>kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed. He<br>knew he was in these men’s power, that only by force had they brought<br>him there, that force alone gave them the right to demand answers<br>to their questions, and that the sole object of that assembly was to<br>inculpate him. And so, as they had the power and wish to inculpate<br>him, this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary. It was<br>evident that any answer would lead to conviction. When asked what he<br>was doing when he was arrested, Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner<br>that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the<br>flames. Why had he fought the marauder? Pierre answered that he “was<br>protecting a woman,” and that “to protect a woman who was being insulted<br>was the duty of every man; that...” They interrupted him, for this<br>was not to the point. Why was he in the yard of a burning house where<br>witnesses had seen him? He replied that he had gone out to see what<br>was happening in Moscow. Again they interrupted him: they had not asked<br>where he was going, but why he was found near the fire? Who was he? they<br>asked, repeating their first question, which he had declined to answer.<br>Again he replied that he could not answer it.<br><br>“Put that down, that’s bad... very bad,” sternly remarked the general<br>with the white mustache and red flushed face.<br><br><br>On the fourth day fires broke out on the Zúbovski rampart.<br><br>Pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchant’s<br>house near the Crimean bridge. On his way through the streets Pierre<br>felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole<br>city. Fires were visible on all sides. He did not then realize the<br>significance of the burning of Moscow, and looked at the fires with<br>horror.<br><br>He passed four days in the coach house near the Crimean bridge and<br>during that time learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, that all<br>those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day<br>from the marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could not learn from the<br>soldiers. Evidently for them “the marshal” represented a very high and<br>rather mysterious power.<br><br>These first days, before the eighth of September when the prisoners were<br>had up for a second examination, were the hardest of all for Pierre.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>On the eighth of September an officer—a very important one judging by<br>the respect the guards showed him—entered the coach house where the<br>prisoners were. This officer, probably someone on the staff, was holding<br>a paper in his hand, and called over all the Russians there, naming<br>Pierre as “the man who does not give his name.” Glancing indolently and<br>indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered the officer in charge<br>to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the<br>marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with<br>thirteen others was led to the Virgin’s Field. It was a fine day, sunny<br>after rain, and the air was unusually pure. The smoke did not hang low<br>as on the day when Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the<br>Zúbovski rampart, but rose through the pure air in columns. No flames<br>were seen, but columns of smoke rose on all sides, and all Moscow as far<br>as Pierre could see was one vast charred ruin. On all sides there were<br>waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing, and<br>here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed<br>at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well. Here and<br>there he could see churches that had not been burned. The Krémlin, which<br>was not destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and<br>the belfry of Iván the Great. The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin<br>glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly.<br>These bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the<br>Nativity of the Virgin. But there seemed to be no one to celebrate this<br>holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and the few Russians to be<br>seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw<br>the French.<br><br>It was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but in<br>place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed, Pierre<br>unconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French order had been<br>established over this ruined nest. He felt this in the looks of<br>the soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily, were<br>escorting him and the other criminals; he felt it in the looks of an<br>important French official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier,<br>whom they met on the way. He felt it in the merry sounds of regimental<br>music he heard from the left side of the field, and felt and realized<br>it especially from the list of prisoners the French officer had read out<br>when he came that morning. Pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers<br>and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men,<br>and it seemed that they might have forgotten him, or confused him with<br>the others. But no: the answers he had given when questioned had come<br>back to him in his designation as “the man who does not give his name,”<br>and under that appellation, which to Pierre seemed terrible, they were<br>now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces<br>that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted<br>and that they were being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself<br>to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose<br>action he did not understand but which was working well.<br><br>He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virgin’s<br>Field, to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the<br>convent. This was Prince Shcherbátov’s house, where Pierre had often<br>been in other days, and which, as he learned from the talk of the<br>soldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of Eckmühl (Davout).<br><br>They were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one.<br>Pierre was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass gallery,<br>an anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a long low<br>study at the door of which stood an adjutant.<br><br>Davout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end of<br>the room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently consulting<br>a paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without raising his eyes,<br>he said in a low voice:<br><br>“Who are you?”<br><br>Pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To him<br>Davout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious for his<br>cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern schoolmaster<br>who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre felt that every<br>instant of delay might cost him his life; but he did not know what<br>to say. He did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first<br>examination, yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and<br>embarrassing. So he was silent. But before he had decided what to do,<br>Davout raised his head, pushed his spectacles back on his forehead,<br>screwed up his eyes, and looked intently at him.<br><br>“I know that man,” he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently<br>calculated to frighten Pierre.<br><br>The chill that had been running down Pierre’s back now seized his head<br>as in a vise.<br><br>“You cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...”<br><br>“He is a Russian spy,” Davout interrupted, addressing another general<br>who was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.<br><br>Davout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his voice Pierre<br>rapidly began:<br><br>“No, monseigneur,” he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a duke.<br>“No, monseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a militia officer and<br>have not quitted Moscow.”<br><br>“Your name?” asked Davout.<br><br>“Bezúkhov.”<br><br>“What proof have I that you are not lying?”<br><br>“Monseigneur!” exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a pleading<br>voice.<br><br>Davout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they looked<br>at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from conditions of war<br>and law, that look established human relations between the two men. At<br>that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their<br>minds, and they realized that they were both children of humanity and<br>were brothers.<br><br>At the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the<br>papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre<br>was merely a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without<br>burdening his conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a<br>human being. He reflected for a moment.<br><br>“How can you show me that you are telling the truth?” said Davout<br>coldly.<br><br>Pierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the<br>street where the house was.<br><br>“You are not what you say,” returned Davout.<br><br>In a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of the<br>truth of his statements.<br><br>But at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to Davout.<br><br>Davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began<br>buttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten Pierre.<br><br>When the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head in<br>Pierre’s direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But<br>where they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach house<br>or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as<br>they crossed the Virgin’s Field.<br><br>He turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another<br>question to Davout.<br><br>“Yes, of course!” replied Davout, but what this “yes” meant, Pierre did<br>not know.<br><br>Pierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was far, or<br>in which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was stupefied,<br>and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others<br>did till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only thought in his<br>mind at that time was: who was it that had really sentenced him to<br>death? Not the men on the commission that had first examined him—not one<br>of them wished to or, evidently, could have done it. It was not Davout,<br>who had looked at him in so human a way. In another moment Davout would<br>have realized that he was doing wrong, but just then the adjutant had<br>come in and interrupted him. The adjutant, also, had evidently had no<br>evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in. Then who was<br>executing him, killing him, depriving him of life—him, Pierre, with all<br>his memories, aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And<br>Pierre felt that it was no one.<br><br>It was a system—a concurrence of circumstances.<br><br>A system of some sort was killing him—Pierre—depriving him of life, of<br>everything, annihilating him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>From Prince Shcherbátov’s house the prisoners were led straight down the<br>Virgin’s Field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen garden<br>in which a post had been set up. Beyond that post a fresh pit had been<br>dug in the ground, and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood<br>in a semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few Russians and many<br>of Napoleon’s soldiers who were not on duty—Germans, Italians, and<br>Frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. To the right and left of the post<br>stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high<br>boots and shakos.<br><br>The prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the list<br>(Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums suddenly<br>began to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre felt as<br>if part of his soul had been torn away. He lost the power of thinking or<br>understanding. He could only hear and see. And he had only one wish—that<br>the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly. Pierre<br>looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them.<br><br>The two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and thin,<br>the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The third was<br>a domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled hair and a<br>plump, well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome<br>man with a broad, light-brown beard and black eyes. The fifth was a<br>factory hand, a thin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat.<br><br>Pierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them separately or<br>two at a time. “In couples,” replied the officer in command in a calm<br>voice. There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident<br>that they were all hurrying—not as men hurry to do something they<br>understand, but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and<br>incomprehensible task.<br><br>A French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of<br>prisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French.<br><br>Then two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at the<br>officer’s command took the two convicts who stood first in the row. The<br>convicts stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks were being<br>brought, looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching<br>huntsman. One crossed himself continually, the other scratched his back<br>and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile. With hurried hands<br>the soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their heads, and<br>bound them to the post.<br><br>Twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm<br>regular tread and halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned away<br>to avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling, rolling<br>noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific<br>thunder, and he looked round. There was some smoke, and the Frenchmen<br>were doing something near the pit, with pale faces and trembling hands.<br>Two more prisoners were led up. In the same way and with similar looks,<br>these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for<br>protection in their eyes, evidently unable to understand or believe<br>what was going to happen to them. They could not believe it because they<br>alone knew what their life meant to them, and so they neither understood<br>nor believed that it could be taken from them.<br><br>Again Pierre did not wish to look and again turned away; but again the<br>sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear, and at the same moment<br>he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces of the Frenchmen who<br>were again doing something by the post, their trembling hands impeding<br>one another. Pierre, breathing heavily, looked around as if asking what<br>it meant. The same question was expressed in all the looks that met his.<br><br>On the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers and officers<br>without exception, he read the same dismay, horror, and conflict that<br>were in his own heart. “But who, after all, is doing this? They are all<br>suffering as I am. Who then is it? Who?” flashed for an instant through<br>his mind.<br><br>“Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward!” shouted someone. The fifth<br>prisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led away—alone. Pierre did not<br>understand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been brought<br>there only to witness the execution. With ever-growing horror, and no<br>sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking place. The fifth man<br>was the factory lad in the loose cloak. The moment they laid hands on<br>him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered<br>and shook himself free.) The lad was unable to walk. They dragged him<br>along, holding him up under the arms, and he screamed. When they got<br>him to the post he grew quiet, as if he suddenly understood something.<br>Whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought<br>it incredible that men should kill him, at any rate he took his stand at<br>the post, waiting to be blindfolded like the others, and like a wounded<br>animal looked around him with glittering eyes.<br><br>Pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His curiosity<br>and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the highest pitch<br>at this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth man seemed calm; he<br>wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other.<br><br>When they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which<br>hurt the back of his head; then when they propped him against the<br>bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in that<br>position, straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned back again<br>more comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss<br>his slightest movement.<br><br>Probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of<br>eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards remember<br>having heard the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw how the<br>workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how blood showed<br>itself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the weight of the<br>hanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head hanging unnaturally<br>and one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one hindered<br>him. Pale, frightened people were doing something around the workman.<br>The lower jaw of an old Frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he<br>untied the ropes. The body collapsed. The soldiers dragged it awkwardly<br>from the post and began pushing it into the pit.<br><br>They all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must<br>hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.<br><br>Pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with<br>his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other.<br>That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively, but spadefuls<br>of earth were already being thrown over the whole body. One of the<br>soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and angrily at Pierre to<br>go back. But Pierre did not understand him and remained near the post,<br>and no one drove him away.<br><br>When the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre was taken<br>back to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the post<br>made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace. The twenty-four<br>sharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing in the center of the<br>circle, ran back to their places as the companies passed by.<br><br>Pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in<br>couples out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies. This<br>one, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed back, and<br>his musket resting on the ground, still stood near the pit at the spot<br>from which he had fired. He swayed like a drunken man, taking some steps<br>forward and back to save himself from falling. An old, noncommissioned<br>officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to<br>his company. The crowd of Russians and Frenchmen began to disperse. They<br>all went away silently and with drooping heads.<br><br>“That will teach them to start fires,” said one of the Frenchmen.<br><br>Pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who<br>was trying to find some relief after what had been done, but was not<br>able to do so. Without finishing what he had begun to say he made a<br>hopeless movement with his arm and went away.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>After the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners<br>and placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.<br><br>Toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and<br>told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for<br>the prisoners of war. Without understanding what was said to him, Pierre<br>got up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the upper end of the<br>field, where there were some sheds built of charred planks, beams,<br>and battens, and led him into one of them. In the darkness some twenty<br>different men surrounded Pierre. He looked at them without understanding<br>who they were, why they were there, or what they wanted of him. He heard<br>what they said, but did not understand the meaning of the words and<br>made no kind of deduction from or application of them. He replied to<br>questions they put to him, but did not consider who was listening to his<br>replies, nor how they would understand them. He looked at their faces<br>and figures, but they all seemed to him equally meaningless.<br><br>From the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by<br>men who did not wish to commit them, it was as if the mainspring of<br>his life, on which everything depended and which made everything appear<br>alive, had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed<br>into a heap of meaningless rubbish. Though he did not acknowledge it to<br>himself, his faith in the right ordering of the universe, in humanity,<br>in his own soul, and in God, had been destroyed. He had experienced this<br>before, but never so strongly as now. When similar doubts had assailed<br>him before, they had been the result of his own wrongdoing, and at the<br>bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from<br>those doubts was to be found within himself. But now he felt that<br>the universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins<br>remained, and this not by any fault of his own. He felt that it was not<br>in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life.<br><br>Around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something<br>about him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and<br>asking him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he<br>found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and<br>talking on all sides.<br><br>“Well, then, mates... that very prince who...” some voice at the other<br>end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word who.<br><br>Sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall,<br>Pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon as<br>he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory<br>lad—especially dreadful because of its simplicity—and the faces of the<br>murderers, even more dreadful because of their disquiet. And he opened<br>his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him.<br><br>Beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he<br>was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from<br>him every time he moved. This man was doing something to his legs in the<br>darkness, and though Pierre could not see his face he felt that the man<br>continually glanced at him. On growing used to the darkness Pierre saw<br>that the man was taking off his leg bands, and the way he did it aroused<br>Pierre’s interest.<br><br>Having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he carefully<br>coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg, glancing up<br>at Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string the other was already<br>unwinding the band on the second leg. In this way, having carefully<br>removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following<br>one another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs<br>fixed above his head. Then he took out a knife, cut something, closed<br>the knife, placed it under the head of his bed, and, seating himself<br>comfortably, clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes<br>on Pierre. The latter was conscious of something pleasant, comforting,<br>and well-rounded in these deft movements, in the man’s well-ordered<br>arrangements in his corner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at<br>the man without taking his eyes from him.<br><br>“You’ve seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?” the little man suddenly said.<br><br>And there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice<br>that Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt tears<br>rising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre no time to betray<br>his confusion, instantly continued in the same pleasant tones:<br><br>“Eh, lad, don’t fret!” said he, in the tender singsong caressing voice<br>old Russian peasant women employ. “Don’t fret, friend—‘suffer an hour,<br>live for an age!’ that’s how it is, my dear fellow. And here we live,<br>thank heaven, without offense. Among these folk, too, there are good<br>men as well as bad,” said he, and still speaking, he turned on his knees<br>with a supple movement, got up, coughed, and went off to another part of<br>the shed.<br><br>“Eh, you rascal!” Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other<br>end of the shed. “So you’ve come, you rascal? She remembers... Now, now,<br>that’ll do!”<br><br>And the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at<br>him, returned to his place and sat down. In his hands he had something<br>wrapped in a rag.<br><br>“Here, eat a bit, sir,” said he, resuming his former respectful tone as<br>he unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes. “We had soup for<br>dinner and the potatoes are grand!”<br><br>Pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed<br>extremely pleasant to him. He thanked the soldier and began to eat.<br><br>“Well, are they all right?” said the soldier with a smile. “You should<br>do like this.”<br><br>He took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into two<br>equal halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it from the<br>rag, and handed it to Pierre.<br><br>“The potatoes are grand!” he said once more. “Eat some like that!”<br><br>Pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.<br><br>“Oh, I’m all right,” said he, “but why did they shoot those poor<br>fellows? The last one was hardly twenty.”<br><br>“Tss, tt...!” said the little man. “Ah, what a sin... what a sin!” he<br>added quickly, and as if his words were always waiting ready in his<br>mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on: “How was it, sir, that you<br>stayed in Moscow?”<br><br>“I didn’t think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally,” replied<br>Pierre.<br><br>“And how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?”<br><br>“No, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me there, and tried<br>me as an incendiary.”<br><br>“Where there’s law there’s injustice,” put in the little man.<br><br>“And have you been here long?” Pierre asked as he munched the last of<br>the potato.<br><br>“I? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow.”<br><br>“Why, are you a soldier then?”<br><br>“Yes, we are soldiers of the Ápsheron regiment. I was dying of fever. We<br>weren’t told anything. There were some twenty of us lying there. We had<br>no idea, never guessed at all.”<br><br>“And do you feel sad here?” Pierre inquired.<br><br>“How can one help it, lad? My name is Platón, and the surname is<br>Karatáev,” he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to<br>address him. “They call me ‘little falcon’ in the regiment. How is one<br>to help feeling sad? Moscow—she’s the mother of cities. How can one see<br>all this and not feel sad? But ‘the maggot gnaws the cabbage, yet dies<br>first’; that’s what the old folks used to tell us,” he added rapidly.<br><br>“What? What did you say?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“Who? I?” said Karatáev. “I say things happen not as we plan but as God<br>judges,” he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had said<br>before, and immediately continued:<br><br>“Well, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you have<br>abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are they still<br>living?” he asked.<br><br>And though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a suppressed<br>smile of kindliness puckered the soldier’s lips as he put these<br>questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, especially that<br>he had no mother.<br><br>“A wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there’s none as<br>dear as one’s own mother!” said he. “Well, and have you little ones?” he<br>went on asking.<br><br>Again Pierre’s negative answer seemed to distress him, and he hastened<br>to add:<br><br>“Never mind! You’re young folks yet, and please God may still have some.<br>The great thing is to live in harmony....”<br><br>“But it’s all the same now,” Pierre could not help saying.<br><br>“Ah, my dear fellow!” rejoined Karatáev, “never decline a prison or a<br>beggar’s sack!”<br><br>He seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently preparing to<br>tell a long story.<br><br>“Well, my dear fellow, I was still living at home,” he began. “We had<br>a well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well and our<br>house was one to thank God for. When Father and we went out mowing<br>there were seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It so<br>happened...”<br><br>And Platón Karatáev told a long story of how he had gone into someone’s<br>copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper, had been<br>tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.<br><br>“Well, lad,” and a smile changed the tone of his voice “we thought it<br>was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing! If it had not been for<br>my sin, my brother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my younger<br>brother, had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a wife<br>behind. We had a little girl, but God took her before I went as a<br>soldier. I come home on leave and I’ll tell you how it was, I look and<br>see that they are living better than before. The yard full of cattle,<br>the women at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only Michael the<br>youngest, at home. Father, he says, ‘All my children are the same to<br>me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten. But if Platón hadn’t<br>been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to go.’ called us<br>all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front of the icons.<br>‘Michael,’ he says, ‘come here and bow down to his feet; and you, young<br>woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also bow down before<br>him! Do you understand?’ he says. That’s how it is, dear fellow. Fate<br>looks for a head. But we are always judging, ‘that’s not well—that’s<br>not right!’ Our luck is like water in a dragnet: you pull at it and it<br>bulges, but when you’ve drawn it out it’s empty! That’s how it is.”<br><br>And Platón shifted his seat on the straw.<br><br>After a short silence he rose.<br><br>“Well, I think you must be sleepy,” said he, and began rapidly crossing<br>himself and repeating:<br><br>“Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus<br>Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, have<br>mercy on us and save us!” he concluded, then bowed to the ground, got<br>up, sighed, and sat down again on his heap of straw. “That’s the way.<br>Lay me down like a stone, O God, and raise me up like a loaf,” he<br>muttered as he lay down, pulling his coat over him.<br><br>“What prayer was that you were saying?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“Eh?” murmured Platón, who had almost fallen asleep. “What was I saying?<br>I was praying. Don’t you pray?”<br><br>“Yes, I do,” said Pierre. “But what was that you said: Frola and Lavra?”<br><br>“Well, of course,” replied Platón quickly, “the horses’ saints. One must<br>pity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now you’ve curled up and got warm,<br>you daughter of a bitch!” said Karatáev, touching the dog that lay at<br>his feet, and again turning over he fell asleep immediately.<br><br>Sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance<br>outside, and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed, but<br>inside it was quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre did not sleep, but<br>lay with eyes open in the darkness, listening to the regular snoring<br>of Platón who lay beside him, and he felt that the world that had been<br>shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on<br>new and unshakable foundations.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>Twenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were confined<br>in the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he remained for<br>four weeks.<br><br>When Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to<br>him except Platón Karatáev, who always remained in his mind a most<br>vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything Russian,<br>kindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn<br>the first impression of him, as of something round, was fully confirmed:<br>Platón’s whole figure—in a French overcoat girdled with a cord, a<br>soldier’s cap, and bast shoes—was round. His head was quite round, his<br>back, chest, shoulders, and even his arms, which he held as if ever<br>ready to embrace something, were rounded, his pleasant smile and his<br>large, gentle brown eyes were also round.<br><br>Platón Karatáev must have been fifty, judging by his stories of<br>campaigns he had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did not himself<br>know his age and was quite unable to determine it. But his brilliantly<br>white, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he<br>laughed—as he often did—were all sound and good, there was not a gray<br>hair in his beard or on his head, and his whole body gave an impression<br>of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance.<br><br>His face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of<br>innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief<br>peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It was<br>evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say,<br>and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an<br>irresistible persuasiveness.<br><br>His physical strength and agility during the first days of his<br>imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and<br>sickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: “Lord, lay me<br>down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!” and every morning on getting<br>up, he said: “I lay down and curled up, I get up and shake myself.” And<br>indeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and he<br>only had to shake himself, to be ready without a moment’s delay for some<br>work, just as children are ready to play directly they awake. He could<br>do everything, not very well but not badly. He baked, cooked, sewed,<br>planed, and mended boots. He was always busy, and only at night allowed<br>himself conversation—of which he was fond—and songs. He did not sing<br>like a trained singer who knows he is listened to, but like the birds,<br>evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches<br>oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness, and the sounds were<br>always high-pitched, mournful, delicate, and almost feminine, and his<br>face at such times was very serious.<br><br>Having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow, he seemed to<br>have thrown off all that had been forced upon him—everything military<br>and alien to himself—and had returned to his former peasant habits.<br><br>“A soldier on leave—a shirt outside breeches,” he would say.<br><br>He did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did not<br>complain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during<br>the whole of his army service. When he related anything it was generally<br>some old and evidently precious memory of his “Christian” life, as he<br>called his peasant existence. The proverbs, of which his talk was full,<br>were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers<br>employ, but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so<br>insignificant, but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance<br>of profound wisdom.<br><br>He would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous<br>occasion, yet both would be right. He liked to talk and he talked well,<br>adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which<br>Pierre thought he invented himself, but the chief charm of his talk lay<br>in the fact that the commonest events—sometimes just such as Pierre<br>had witnessed without taking notice of them—assumed in Karatáev’s a<br>character of solemn fitness. He liked to hear the folk tales one of the<br>soldiers used to tell of an evening (they were always the same), but<br>most of all he liked to hear stories of real life. He would smile<br>joyfully when listening to such stories, now and then putting in a word<br>or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear<br>to himself. Karatáev had no attachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre<br>understood them, but loved and lived affectionately with everything life<br>brought him in contact with, particularly with man—not any particular<br>man, but those with whom he happened to be. He loved his dog, his<br>comrades, the French, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt<br>that in spite of Karatáev’s affectionate tenderness for him (by which<br>he unconsciously gave Pierre’s spiritual life its due) he would not have<br>grieved for a moment at parting from him. And Pierre began to feel in<br>the same way toward Karatáev.<br><br>To all the other prisoners Platón Karatáev seemed a most ordinary<br>soldier. They called him “little falcon” or “Platósha,” chaffed him<br>good-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But to Pierre he always<br>remained what he had seemed that first night: an unfathomable, rounded,<br>eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth.<br><br>Platón Karatáev knew nothing by heart except his prayers. When he began<br>to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.<br><br>Sometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, would ask him to<br>repeat them, but Platón could never recall what he had said a moment<br>before, just as he never could repeat to Pierre the words of his<br>favorite song: native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in<br>it, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning could be got out of it. He<br>did not, and could not, understand the meaning of words apart from<br>their context. Every word and action of his was the manifestation of<br>an activity unknown to him, which was his life. But his life, as he<br>regarded it, had no meaning as a separate thing. It had meaning only as<br>part of a whole of which he was always conscious. His words and actions<br>flowed from him as evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance<br>exhales from a flower. He could not understand the value or significance<br>of any word or deed taken separately.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>When Princess Mary heard from Nicholas that her brother was with the<br>Rostóvs at Yaroslávl she at once prepared to go there, in spite of her<br>aunt’s efforts to dissuade her—and not merely to go herself but to take<br>her nephew with her. Whether it were difficult or easy, possible or<br>impossible, she did not ask and did not want to know: it was her duty,<br>not only to herself, to be near her brother who was perhaps dying, but<br>to do everything possible to take his son to him, and so she prepared<br>to set off. That she had not heard from Prince Andrew himself, Princess<br>Mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the<br>long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son.<br><br>In a few days Princess Mary was ready to start. Her equipages were the<br>huge family coach in which she had traveled to Vorónezh, a semiopen<br>trap, and a baggage cart. With her traveled Mademoiselle Bourienne,<br>little Nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three maids, Tíkhon, and a<br>young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her.<br><br>The usual route through Moscow could not be thought of, and the<br>roundabout way Princess Mary was obliged to take through Lípetsk,<br>Ryazán, Vladímir, and Shúya was very long and, as post horses were not<br>everywhere obtainable, very difficult, and near Ryazán where the French<br>were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous.<br><br>During this difficult journey Mademoiselle Bourienne, Dessalles, and<br>Princess Mary’s servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of<br>spirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and<br>no difficulties daunted her. Thanks to her activity and energy, which<br>infected her fellow travelers, they approached Yaroslávl by the end of<br>the second week.<br><br>The last days of her stay in Vorónezh had been the happiest of her life.<br>Her love for Rostóv no longer tormented or agitated her. It filled her<br>whole soul, had become an integral part of herself, and she no longer<br>struggled against it. Latterly she had become convinced that she loved<br>and was beloved, though she never said this definitely to herself<br>in words. She had become convinced of it at her last interview with<br>Nicholas, when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the<br>Rostóvs. Not by a single word had Nicholas alluded to the fact that<br>Prince Andrew’s relations with Natásha might, if he recovered, be<br>renewed, but Princess Mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of<br>this.<br><br>Yet in spite of that, his relation to her—considerate, delicate, and<br>loving—not only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to Princess<br>Mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them<br>allowed him to express his friendship more freely. She knew that she<br>loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was<br>beloved, and was happy in regard to it.<br><br>But this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent<br>her feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the contrary, that<br>spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her<br>to give full play to her feeling for her brother. That feeling was so<br>strong at the moment of leaving Vorónezh that those who saw her off, as<br>they looked at her careworn, despairing face, felt sure she would fall<br>ill on the journey. But the very difficulties and preoccupations of the<br>journey, which she took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from<br>her grief and gave her strength.<br><br>As always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of the<br>journey itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached Yaroslávl<br>the thought of what might await her there—not after many days, but that<br>very evening—again presented itself to her and her agitation increased<br>to its utmost limit.<br><br>The courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the<br>Rostóvs were staying in Yaroslávl, and in what condition Prince Andrew<br>was, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled<br>by the terrible pallor of the princess’ face that looked out at him from<br>the window.<br><br>“I have found out everything, your excellency: the Rostóvs are staying<br>at the merchant Brónnikov’s house, in the Square not far from here,<br>right above the Vólga,” said the courier.<br><br>Princess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not understanding<br>why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how was her<br>brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.<br><br>“How is the prince?” she asked.<br><br>“His excellency is staying in the same house with them.”<br><br>“Then he is alive,” thought Princess Mary, and asked in a low voice:<br>“How is he?”<br><br>“The servants say he is still the same.”<br><br>What “still the same” might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with an<br>unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sitting in<br>front of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her head<br>and did not raise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking and<br>swaying, came to a stop. The carriage steps clattered as they were let<br>down.<br><br>The carriage door was opened. On the left there was water—a great<br>river—and on the right a porch. There were people at the entrance:<br>servants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair, smiling as<br>it seemed to Princess Mary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This was<br>Sónya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps. “This way, this way!” said the<br>girl, with the same artificial smile, and the princess found herself in<br>the hall facing an elderly woman of Oriental type, who came rapidly to<br>meet her with a look of emotion. This was the countess. She embraced<br>Princess Mary and kissed her.<br><br>“Mon enfant!” she muttered, “je vous aime et vous connais depuis<br>longtemps.” *<br><br>    * “My child! I love you and have known you a long time.”<br><br><br>Despite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the<br>countess and that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly<br>knowing how she did it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in<br>French in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her, and<br>asked: “How is he?”<br><br>“The doctor says that he is not in danger,” said the countess, but as<br>she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed a<br>contradiction of her words.<br><br>“Where is he? Can I see him—can I?” asked the princess.<br><br>“One moment, Princess, one moment, my dear! Is this his son?” said the<br>countess, turning to little Nicholas who was coming in with Dessalles.<br>“There will be room for everybody, this is a big house. Oh, what a<br>lovely boy!”<br><br>The countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where Sónya was<br>talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess caressed the boy, and<br>the old count came in and welcomed the princess. He had changed very<br>much since Princess Mary had last seen him. Then he had been a brisk,<br>cheerful, self-assured old man; now he seemed a pitiful, bewildered<br>person. While talking to Princess Mary he continually looked round as<br>if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing. After the<br>destruction of Moscow and of his property, thrown out of his accustomed<br>groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to<br>feel that there was no longer a place for him in life.<br><br>In spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible, and<br>her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they<br>should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew,<br>the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the<br>necessity of submitting, for a time, to this new order of things which<br>she had entered. She knew it to be necessary, and though it was hard for<br>her she was not vexed with these people.<br><br>“This is my niece,” said the count, introducing Sónya—“You don’t know<br>her, Princess?”<br><br>Princess Mary turned to Sónya and, trying to stifle the hostile<br>feeling that arose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But she felt<br>oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far<br>from what was in her own heart.<br><br>“Where is he?” she asked again, addressing them all.<br><br>“He is downstairs. Natásha is with him,” answered Sónya, flushing. “We<br>have sent to ask. I think you must be tired, Princess.”<br><br>Tears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary’s eyes. She turned<br>away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him, when<br>light, impetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door.<br>The princess looked round and saw Natásha coming in, almost running—that<br>Natásha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in Moscow long<br>since.<br><br>But hardly had the princess looked at Natásha’s face before she realized<br>that here was a real comrade in her grief, and consequently a friend.<br>She ran to meet her, embraced her, and began to cry on her shoulder.<br><br>As soon as Natásha, sitting at the head of Prince Andrew’s bed, heard<br>of Princess Mary’s arrival, she softly left his room and hastened to her<br>with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to Princess Mary.<br><br>There was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the<br>drawing room—that of love—boundless love for him, for her, and for all<br>that was near to the man she loved; and of pity, suffering for others,<br>and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them. It was<br>plain that at that moment there was in Natásha’s heart no thought of<br>herself or of her own relations with Prince Andrew.<br><br>Princess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all this at the<br>first glance at Natásha’s face, and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful<br>pleasure.<br><br>“Come, come to him, Mary,” said Natásha, leading her into the other<br>room.<br><br>Princess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned to Natásha.<br>She felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn<br>everything.<br><br>“How...” she began her question but stopped short.<br><br>She felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words.<br>Natásha’s face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and<br>profoundly.<br><br>Natásha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say<br>all she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes<br>which penetrated into the very depths of her heart, it was impossible<br>not to tell the whole truth which she saw. And suddenly, Natásha’s lips<br>twitched, ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and covering her face<br>with her hands she burst into sobs.<br><br>Princess Mary understood.<br><br>But she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not trust:<br><br>“But how is his wound? What is his general condition?”<br><br>“You, you... will see,” was all Natásha could say.<br><br>They sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off<br>crying and were able to go to him with calm faces.<br><br>“How has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he grew worse? When<br>did this happen?” Princess Mary inquired.<br><br>Natásha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish<br>condition and the pain he suffered, but at Tróitsa that had passed<br>and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. That danger had also<br>passed. When they reached Yaroslávl the wound had begun to fester<br>(Natásha knew all about such things as festering) and the doctor had<br>said that the festering might take a normal course. Then fever set in,<br>but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious.<br><br>“But two days ago this suddenly happened,” said Natásha, struggling with<br>her sobs. “I don’t know why, but you will see what he is like.”<br><br>“Is he weaker? Thinner?” asked the princess.<br><br>“No, it’s not that, but worse. You will see. O, Mary, he is too good, he<br>cannot, cannot live, because...”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>When Natásha opened Prince Andrew’s door with a familiar movement and<br>let Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess felt the<br>sobs in her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now<br>tried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to look at<br>him without tears.<br><br>The princess understood what Natásha had meant by the words: “two days<br>ago this suddenly happened.” She understood those words to mean that he<br>had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs<br>of approaching death. As she stepped to the door she already saw in<br>imagination Andrew’s face as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle,<br>mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore<br>affected her very strongly. She was sure he would speak soft, tender<br>words to her such as her father had uttered before his death, and<br>that she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his<br>presence. Yet sooner or later it had to be, and she went in. The sobs<br>rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly<br>distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his<br>features, and then she saw his face and met his gaze.<br><br>He was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan, surrounded by<br>pillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin, translucently white hand<br>he held a handkerchief, while with the other he stroked the delicate<br>mustache he had grown, moving his fingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them<br>as they entered.<br><br>On seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary’s pace suddenly<br>slackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She suddenly<br>felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and<br>eyes.<br><br>“But in what am I to blame?” she asked herself. And his cold, stern look<br>replied: “Because you are alive and thinking of the living, while I...”<br><br>In the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there<br>was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and<br>Natásha.<br><br>He kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont.<br><br>“How are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?” said he in a voice<br>as calm and aloof as his look.<br><br>Had he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such horror<br>into Princess Mary’s heart as the tone of his voice.<br><br>“And have you brought little Nicholas?” he asked in the same slow, quiet<br>manner and with an obvious effort to remember.<br><br>“How are you now?” said Princess Mary, herself surprised at what she was<br>saying.<br><br>“That, my dear, you must ask the doctor,” he replied, and again making<br>an evident effort to be affectionate, he said with his lips only (his<br>words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts):<br><br>“Merci, chère amie, d’être venue.” *<br><br>    * “Thank you for coming, my dear.”<br><br><br>Princess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince just<br>perceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to say. She now<br>understood what had happened to him two days before. In his words, his<br>tone, and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic look could be<br>felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world, terrible<br>in one who is alive. Evidently only with an effort did he understand<br>anything living; but it was obvious that he failed to understand, not<br>because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something<br>else—something the living did not and could not understand—and which<br>wholly occupied his mind.<br><br>“There, you see how strangely fate has brought us together,” said he,<br>breaking the silence and pointing to Natásha. “She looks after me all<br>the time.”<br><br>Princess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a<br>thing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say that,<br>before her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to live he<br>could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone. If he had<br>not known that he was dying, how could he have failed to pity her and<br>how could he speak like that in her presence? The only explanation was<br>that he was indifferent, because something else, much more important,<br>had been revealed to him.<br><br>The conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off.<br><br>“Mary came by way of Ryazán,” said Natásha.<br><br>Prince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary, and only<br>after calling her so in his presence did Natásha notice it herself.<br><br>“Really?” he asked.<br><br>“They told her that all Moscow has been burned down, and that...”<br><br>Natásha stopped. It was impossible to talk. It was plain that he was<br>making an effort to listen, but could not do so.<br><br>“Yes, they say it’s burned,” he said. “It’s a great pity,” and he gazed<br>straight before him, absently stroking his mustache with his fingers.<br><br>“And so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?” Prince Andrew suddenly said,<br>evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them. “He wrote here that he<br>took a great liking to you,” he went on simply and calmly, evidently<br>unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for<br>living people. “If you liked him too, it would be a good thing for you<br>to get married,” he added rather more quickly, as if pleased at having<br>found words he had long been seeking.<br><br>Princess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her, except as<br>a proof of how far away he now was from everything living.<br><br>“Why talk of me?” she said quietly and glanced at Natásha.<br><br>Natásha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were again<br>silent.<br><br>“Andrew, would you like...” Princess Mary suddenly said in a trembling<br>voice, “would you like to see little Nicholas? He is always talking<br>about you!”<br><br>Prince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but<br>Princess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he did<br>not smile with pleasure or affection for his son, but with quiet, gentle<br>irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last<br>means of arousing him.<br><br>“Yes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?”<br><br>When little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew’s room he looked at<br>his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one else<br>was crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to<br>say to him.<br><br>When Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went up to her<br>brother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears any longer began<br>to cry.<br><br>He looked at her attentively.<br><br>“Is it about Nicholas?” he asked.<br><br>Princess Mary nodded her head, weeping.<br><br>“Mary, you know the Gosp...” but he broke off.<br><br>“What did you say?”<br><br>“Nothing. You mustn’t cry here,” he said, looking at her with the same<br>cold expression.<br><br><br>When Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying at<br>the thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father. With<br>a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their<br>point of view.<br><br>“Yes, to them it must seem sad!” he thought. “But how simple it is.<br><br>“The fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father<br>feedeth them,” he said to himself and wished to say to Princess Mary;<br>“but no, they will take it their own way, they won’t understand! They<br>can’t understand that all those feelings they prize so—all our feelings,<br>all those ideas that seem so important to us, are unnecessary. We cannot<br>understand one another,” and he remained silent.<br><br><br>Prince Andrew’s little son was seven. He could scarcely read, and knew<br>nothing. After that day he lived through many things, gaining knowledge,<br>observation, and experience, but had he possessed all the faculties he<br>afterwards acquired, he could not have had a better or more profound<br>understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between<br>his father, Mary, and Natásha, than he had then. He understood it<br>completely, and, leaving the room without crying, went silently up<br>to Natásha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his<br>beautiful, thoughtful eyes, then his uplifted, rosy upper lip trembled<br>and leaning his head against her he began to cry.<br><br>After that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed him and<br>either sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary, or to Natásha of whom<br>he seemed even fonder than of his aunt, and clung to them quietly and<br>shyly.<br><br>When Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood what<br>Natásha’s face had told her. She did not speak any more to Natásha of<br>hopes of saving his life. She took turns with her beside his sofa, and<br>did not cry any more, but prayed continually, turning in soul to that<br>Eternal and Unfathomable, whose presence above the dying man was now so<br>evident.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>Not only did Prince Andrew know he would die, but he felt that he was<br>dying and was already half dead. He was conscious of an aloofness from<br>everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence.<br>Without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming. That inexorable,<br>eternal, distant, and unknown the presence of which he had felt<br>continually all his life—was now near to him and, by the strange<br>lightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and palpable....<br><br><br>Formerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that terribly<br>tormenting fear of death—the end—but now he no longer understood that<br>fear.<br><br>He had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before<br>him, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, and the sky, and<br>knew that he was face to face with death. When he came to himself after<br>being wounded and the flower of eternal, unfettered love had instantly<br>unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that<br>had restrained it, he no longer feared death and ceased to think about<br>it.<br><br>During the hours of solitude, suffering, and partial delirium he<br>spent after he was wounded, the more deeply he penetrated into the new<br>principle of eternal love revealed to him, the more he unconsciously<br>detached himself from earthly life. To love everything and everybody and<br>always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone, not<br>to live this earthly life. And the more imbued he became with that<br>principle of love, the more he renounced life and the more completely he<br>destroyed that dreadful barrier which—in the absence of such love—stands<br>between life and death. When during those first days he remembered that<br>he would have to die, he said to himself: “Well, what of it? So much the<br>better!”<br><br>But after the night in Mytíshchi when, half delirious, he had seen her<br>for whom he longed appear before him and, having pressed her hand to his<br>lips, had shed gentle, happy tears, love for a particular woman again<br>crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life. And<br>joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind. Recalling the<br>moment at the ambulance station when he had seen Kurágin, he could not<br>now regain the feeling he then had, but was tormented by the question<br>whether Kurágin was alive. And he dared not inquire.<br><br>His illness pursued its normal physical course, but what Natásha<br>referred to when she said: “This suddenly happened,” had occurred two<br>days before Princess Mary arrived. It was the last spiritual struggle<br>between life and death, in which death gained the victory. It was<br>the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as<br>presented to him in the form of his love for Natásha, and a last, though<br>ultimately vanquished, attack of terror before the unknown.<br><br>It was evening. As usual after dinner he was slightly feverish, and his<br>thoughts were preternaturally clear. Sónya was sitting by the table. He<br>began to doze. Suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him.<br><br>“Ah, she has come!” thought he.<br><br>And so it was: in Sónya’s place sat Natásha who had just come in<br>noiselessly.<br><br>Since she had begun looking after him, he had always experienced this<br>physical consciousness of her nearness. She was sitting in an armchair<br>placed sideways, screening the light of the candle from him, and was<br>knitting a stocking. She had learned to knit stockings since Prince<br>Andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old<br>nurses who knit stockings, and that there is something soothing in<br>the knitting of stockings. The needles clicked lightly in her slender,<br>rapidly moving hands, and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile<br>of her drooping face. She moved, and the ball rolled off her knees. She<br>started, glanced round at him, and screening the candle with her hand<br>stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement, picked up the ball,<br>and regained her former position.<br><br>He looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a<br>deep breath after stooping, but refrained from doing so and breathed<br>cautiously.<br><br>At the Tróitsa monastery they had spoken of the past, and he had told<br>her that if he lived he would always thank God for his wound which had<br>brought them together again, but after that they never spoke of the<br>future.<br><br>“Can it or can it not be?” he now thought as he looked at her and<br>listened to the light click of the steel needles. “Can fate have brought<br>me to her so strangely only for me to die?... Is it possible that the<br>truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that I have spent<br>my life in falsity? I love her more than anything in the world! But what<br>am I to do if I love her?” he thought, and he involuntarily groaned,<br>from a habit acquired during his sufferings.<br><br>On hearing that sound Natásha put down the stocking, leaned nearer to<br>him, and suddenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped lightly up to him<br>and bent over him.<br><br>“You are not asleep?”<br><br>“No, I have been looking at you a long time. I felt you come in. No one<br>else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do... that light.<br>I want to weep for joy.”<br><br>Natásha drew closer to him. Her face shone with rapturous joy.<br><br>“Natásha, I love you too much! More than anything in the world.”<br><br>“And I!”—She turned away for an instant. “Why too much?” she asked.<br><br>“Why too much?... Well, what do you, what do you feel in your soul, your<br>whole soul—shall I live? What do you think?”<br><br>“I am sure of it, sure!” Natásha almost shouted, taking hold of both his<br>hands with a passionate movement.<br><br>He remained silent awhile.<br><br>“How good it would be!” and taking her hand he kissed it.<br><br>Natásha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that this would<br>not do and that he had to be quiet.<br><br>“But you have not slept,” she said, repressing her joy. “Try to sleep...<br>please!”<br><br>He pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle and<br>sat down again in her former position. Twice she turned and looked at<br>him, and her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on her<br>stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished.<br><br>Soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep long and<br>suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration.<br><br>As he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now<br>always occupied his mind—about life and death, and chiefly about death.<br>He felt himself nearer to it.<br><br>“Love? What is love?” he thought.<br><br>“Love hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that I understand, I<br>understand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only<br>because I love. Everything is united by it alone. Love is God, and to<br>die means that I, a particle of love, shall return to the general and<br>eternal source.” These thoughts seemed to him comforting. But they were<br>only thoughts. Something was lacking in them, they were not clear, they<br>were too one-sidedly personal and brain-spun. And there was the former<br>agitation and obscurity. He fell asleep.<br><br>He dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in, but that<br>he was quite well and unwounded. Many various, indifferent, and<br>insignificant people appeared before him. He talked to them and<br>discussed something trivial. They were preparing to go away somewhere.<br>Prince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had<br>more important cares, but he continued to speak, surprising them by<br>empty witticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all these persons began to<br>disappear and a single question, that of the closed door, superseded<br>all else. He rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it. Everything<br>depended on whether he was, or was not, in time to lock it. He went, and<br>tried to hurry, but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be<br>in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers. He<br>was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was the fear of death. It<br>stood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily creeping toward<br>the door, that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing<br>against it and forcing its way in. Something not human—death—was<br>breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized the<br>door, making a final effort to hold it back—to lock it was no longer<br>possible—but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from<br>behind by that terror, opened and closed again.<br><br>Once again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts were vain<br>and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and it was<br>death, and Prince Andrew died.<br><br>But at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was asleep,<br>and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he awoke.<br><br>“Yes, it was death! I died—and woke up. Yes, death is an awakening!” And<br>all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then<br>concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision. He felt as<br>if powers till then confined within him had been liberated, and that<br>strange lightness did not again leave him.<br><br>When, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan, Natásha went<br>up and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer and looked at<br>her strangely, not understanding.<br><br>That was what had happened to him two days before Princess Mary’s<br>arrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting fever<br>assumed a malignant character, but what the doctor said did not interest<br>Natásha, she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more<br>convincing.<br><br>From that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew together with<br>his awakening from sleep. And compared to the duration of life it did<br>not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the<br>duration of a dream.<br><br>There was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow<br>awakening.<br><br>His last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. Both<br>Princess Mary and Natásha, who did not leave him, felt this. They did<br>not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt<br>that they were not attending on him (he was no longer there, he had left<br>them) but on what reminded them most closely of him—his body. Both felt<br>this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not<br>affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief.<br>Neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep, nor did they ever<br>talk to one another about him. They felt that they could not express in<br>words what they understood.<br><br>They both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly, deeper and deeper,<br>away from them, and they both knew that this had to be so and that it<br>was right.<br><br>He confessed, and received communion: everyone came to take leave of<br>him. When they brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to the boy’s<br>and turned away, not because he felt it hard and sad (Princess Mary and<br>Natásha understood that) but simply because he thought it was all that<br>was required of him, but when they told him to bless the boy, he did<br>what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was<br>anything else he should do.<br><br>When the last convulsions of the body, which the spirit was leaving,<br>occurred, Princess Mary and Natásha were present.<br><br>“Is it over?” said Princess Mary when his body had for a few minutes<br>lain motionless, growing cold before them. Natásha went up, looked at<br>the dead eyes, and hastened to close them. She closed them but did not<br>kiss them, but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of him—his<br>body.<br><br>“Where has he gone? Where is he now?...”<br><br>When the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a table,<br>everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept.<br><br>Little Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity.<br>The countess and Sónya cried from pity for Natásha and because he was<br>no more. The old count cried because he felt that before long, he, too,<br>must take the same terrible step.<br><br>Natásha and Princess Mary also wept now, but not because of their own<br>personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which<br>had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the<br>simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their<br>presence.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK THIRTEEN: 1812<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>Man’s mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness, but<br>the desire to find those causes is implanted in man’s soul. And without<br>considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one<br>of which taken separately may seem to be the cause, he snatches at the<br>first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says:<br>“This is the cause!” In historical events (where the actions of men are<br>the subject of observation) the first and most primitive approximation<br>to present itself was the will of the gods and, after that, the will of<br>those who stood in the most prominent position—the heroes of history.<br>But we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic event—which<br>lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it—to<br>be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the<br>actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled. It may seem<br>to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of<br>historical events this way or that; yet there is the same difference<br>between a man who says that the people of the West moved on the East<br>because Napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because<br>it had to happen, as there is between those who declared that the<br>earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who<br>admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth, but knew there<br>were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets. There<br>is, and can be, no cause of an historical event except the one cause of<br>all causes. But there are laws directing events, and some of these laws<br>are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend.<br>The discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite<br>abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man,<br>just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was<br>possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the<br>earth.<br><br>The historians consider that, next to the battle of Borodinó and the<br>occupation of Moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire, the most<br>important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the Russian<br>army from the Ryazána to the Kalúga road and to the Tarútino camp—the<br>so-called flank march across the Krásnaya Pakhrá River. They ascribe the<br>glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to<br>whom the honor is due. Even foreign historians, including the French,<br>acknowledge the genius of the Russian commanders when they speak of<br>that flank march. But it is hard to understand why military writers,<br>and following them others, consider this flank march to be the profound<br>conception of some one man who saved Russia and destroyed Napoleon. In<br>the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius<br>of this movement lay, for not much mental effort was needed to see that<br>the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where<br>there are most provisions; and even a dull boy of thirteen could have<br>guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from Moscow<br>in 1812 was on the Kalúga road. So it is impossible to understand by<br>what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver<br>was a profound one. And it is even more difficult to understand just why<br>they think that this maneuver was calculated to save Russia and destroy<br>the French; for this flank march, had it been preceded, accompanied,<br>or followed by other circumstances, might have proved ruinous to the<br>Russians and salutary for the French. If the position of the Russian<br>army really began to improve from the time of that march, it does not at<br>all follow that the march was the cause of it.<br><br>That flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to<br>the Russian army, but might in other circumstances have led to its<br>destruction. What would have happened had Moscow not burned down? If<br>Murat had not lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had not remained<br>inactive? If the Russian army at Krásnaya Pakhrá had given battle as<br>Bennigsen and Barclay advised? What would have happened had the French<br>attacked the Russians while they were marching beyond the Pakhrá? What<br>would have happened if on approaching Tarútino, Napoleon had attacked<br>the Russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he<br>attacked them at Smolénsk? What would have happened had the French moved<br>on Petersburg?... In any of these eventualities the flank march that<br>brought salvation might have proved disastrous.<br><br>The third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying<br>history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be<br>attributed to any one man, that no one ever foresaw it, and that in<br>reality, like the retreat from Filí, it did not suggest itself to anyone<br>in its entirety, but resulted—moment by moment, step by step, event by<br>event—from an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only<br>seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the<br>past.<br><br>At the council at Filí the prevailing thought in the minds of the<br>Russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely, a<br>direct retreat by the Nízhni road. In proof of this there is the fact<br>that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat, and above<br>all there is the well-known conversation after the council, between the<br>commander in chief and Lanskóy, who was in charge of the commissariat<br>department. Lanskóy informed the commander in chief that the army<br>supplies were for the most part stored along the Oká in the Túla and<br>Ryazán provinces, and that if they retreated on Nízhni the army would<br>be separated from its supplies by the broad river Oká, which cannot be<br>crossed early in winter. This was the first indication of the necessity<br>of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural course—a<br>direct retreat on Nízhni-Nóvgorod. The army turned more to the south,<br>along the Ryazán road and nearer to its supplies. Subsequently the<br>inactivity of the French (who even lost sight of the Russian army),<br>concern for the safety of the arsenal at Túla, and especially the<br>advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn<br>still further south to the Túla road. Having crossed over, by a forced<br>march, to the Túla road beyond the Pakhrá, the Russian commanders<br>intended to remain at Podólsk and had no thought of the Tarútino<br>position; but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of French<br>troops who had for a time lost touch with the Russians, and projects<br>of giving battle, and above all the abundance of provisions in Kalúga<br>province, obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross<br>from the Túla to the Kalúga road and go to Tarútino, which was between<br>the roads along which those supplies lay. Just as it is impossible to<br>say when it was decided to abandon Moscow, so it is impossible to say<br>precisely when, or by whom, it was decided to move to Tarútino. Only<br>when the army had got there, as the result of innumerable and varying<br>forces, did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this<br>movement and long ago foreseen its result.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>The famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the advance<br>of the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been continually<br>retreating straight back from the invaders, deviated from that direct<br>course and, not finding itself pursued, was naturally drawn toward the<br>district where supplies were abundant.<br><br>If instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the<br>Russian army, we picture that army without any leaders, it could not<br>have done anything but make a return movement toward Moscow, describing<br>an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where<br>the country was richest.<br><br>That movement from the Nízhni to the Ryazán, Túla, and Kalúga roads was<br>so natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that direction, and<br>demands were sent from Petersburg for Kutúzov to take his army that<br>way. At Tarútino Kutúzov received what was almost a reprimand from<br>the Emperor for having moved his army along the Ryazán road, and the<br>Emperor’s letter indicated to him the very position he had already<br>occupied near Kalúga.<br><br>Having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the<br>whole campaign and by the battle of Borodinó, the Russian army—when<br>the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was<br>received—assumed the position natural to it.<br><br>Kutúzov’s merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, as it is<br>called, but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of<br>what had happened. He alone then understood the meaning of the French<br>army’s inactivity, he alone continued to assert that the battle of<br>Borodinó had been a victory, he alone—who as commander in chief might<br>have been expected to be eager to attack—employed his whole strength to<br>restrain the Russian army from useless engagements.<br><br>The beast wounded at Borodinó was lying where the fleeing hunter had<br>left him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and<br>merely lying low, the hunter did not know. Suddenly the beast was heard<br>to moan.<br><br>The moan of that wounded beast (the French army) which betrayed its<br>calamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to Kutúzov’s camp with<br>overtures for peace.<br><br>Napoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was<br>right, wrote to Kutúzov the first words that occurred to him, though<br>they were meaningless.<br><br><br>MONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending one of my adjutants-general<br>to discuss several interesting questions with you. I beg your Highness<br>to credit what he says to you, especially when he expresses the<br>sentiment of esteem and special regard I have long entertained for your<br>person. This letter having no other object, I pray God, monsieur le<br>prince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and gracious protection!<br><br>NAPOLEON<br><br>MOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812<br><br><br>Kutúzov replied: “I should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as<br>the initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such is the present spirit<br>of my nation.” But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his<br>troops from attacking.<br><br>During the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and<br>the Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tarútino, a change had taken<br>place in the relative strength of the two armies—both in spirit and in<br>number—as a result of which the superiority had passed to the Russian<br>side. Though the condition and numbers of the French army were unknown<br>to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking<br>at once showed itself by countless signs. These signs were: Lauriston’s<br>mission; the abundance of provisions at Tarútino; the reports coming in<br>from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of<br>recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian<br>soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been<br>assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been<br>resting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost sight of,<br>was doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to<br>the French stationed at Tarútino; the news of easy successes gained by<br>peasants and guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this;<br>the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as<br>the French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every<br>soldier’s mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and<br>that the advantage was now on our side. There was a substantial change<br>in the relative strength, and an advance had become inevitable. And at<br>once, as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand<br>has completed a full circle, this change was shown by an increased<br>activity, whirring, and chiming in the higher spheres.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>The Russian army was commanded by Kutúzov and his staff, and also by the<br>Emperor from Petersburg. Before the news of the abandonment of Moscow<br>had been received in Petersburg, a detailed plan of the whole campaign<br>had been drawn up and sent to Kutúzov for his guidance. Though this plan<br>had been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow was still in our hands,<br>it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action.<br>Kutúzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always<br>difficult to execute. So fresh instructions were sent for the solution<br>of difficulties that might be encountered, as well as fresh people who<br>were to watch Kutúzov’s actions and report upon them.<br><br>Besides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now reorganized.<br>The posts left vacant by Bagratión, who had been killed, and by<br>Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be filled. Very serious<br>consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to<br>put A in B’s place and B in D’s, or on the contrary to put D in A’s<br>place, and so on—as if anything more than A’s or B’s satisfaction<br>depended on this.<br><br>As a result of the hostility between Kutúzov and Bennigsen, his Chief of<br>Staff, the presence of confidential representatives of the Emperor, and<br>these transfers, a more than usually complicated play of parties<br>was going on among the staff of the army. A was undermining B, D was<br>undermining C, and so on in all possible combinations and permutations.<br>In all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct<br>of the war, which all these men believed they were directing; but this<br>affair of the war went on independently of them, as it had to go:<br>that is, never in the way people devised, but flowing always from the<br>essential attitude of the masses. Only in the highest spheres did<br>all these schemes, crossings, and interminglings appear to be a true<br>reflection of what had to happen.<br><br><br>Prince Michael Ilariónovich! (wrote the Emperor on the second of October<br>in a letter that reached Kutúzov after the battle at Tarútino) Since<br>September 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enemy. Your last reports<br>were written on the twentieth, and during all this time not only has<br>no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient<br>capital, but according to your last report you have even retreated<br>farther. Sérpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and Túla<br>with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army, is in danger.<br>From General Wintzingerode’s reports, I see that an enemy corps of ten<br>thousand men is moving on the Petersburg road. Another corps of several<br>thousand men is moving on Dmítrov. A third has advanced along the<br>Vladímir road, and a fourth, rather considerable detachment is stationed<br>between Rúza and Mozháysk. Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as<br>the twenty-fifth. In view of all this information, when the enemy has<br>scattered his forces in large detachments, and with Napoleon and his<br>Guards in Moscow, is it possible that the enemy’s forces confronting you<br>are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive? On the<br>contrary, he is probably pursuing you with detachments, or at most with<br>an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you. It would seem<br>that, availing yourself of these circumstances, you might advantageously<br>attack a weaker one and annihilate him, or at least oblige him to<br>retreat, retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now<br>occupied by the enemy, and thereby averting danger from Túla and other<br>towns in the interior. You will be responsible if the enemy is able to<br>direct a force of any size against Petersburg to threaten this capital<br>in which it has not been possible to retain many troops; for with the<br>army entrusted to you, and acting with resolution and energy, you have<br>ample means to avert this fresh calamity. Remember that you have still<br>to answer to our offended country for the loss of Moscow. You have<br>experienced my readiness to reward you. That readiness will not weaken<br>in me, but I and Russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal,<br>firmness, and success which your intellect, military talent, and the<br>courage of the troops you command justify us in expecting.<br><br><br>But by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation of<br>the forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was dispatched,<br>Kutúzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he<br>commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place.<br><br>On the second of October a Cossack, Shapoválov, who was out scouting,<br>killed one hare and wounded another. Following the wounded hare he made<br>his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of Murat’s<br>army, encamped there without any precautions. The Cossack laughingly<br>told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the French.<br>A cornet, hearing the story, informed his commander.<br><br>The Cossack was sent for and questioned. The Cossack officers wished<br>to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses, but one of<br>the superior officers, who was acquainted with the higher authorities,<br>reported the incident to a general on the staff. The state of things on<br>the staff had of late been exceedingly strained. Ermólov had been to<br>see Bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use<br>his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take the<br>offensive.<br><br>“If I did not know you I should think you did not want what you are<br>asking for. I need only advise anything and his Highness is sure to do<br>the opposite,” replied Bennigsen.<br><br>The Cossack’s report, confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out, was<br>the final proof that events had matured. The tightly coiled spring was<br>released, the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play. Despite all<br>his supposed power, his intellect, his experience, and his knowledge<br>of men, Kutúzov—having taken into consideration the Cossack’s report, a<br>note from Bennigsen who sent personal reports to the Emperor, the wishes<br>he supposed the Emperor to hold, and the fact that all the generals<br>expressed the same wish—could no longer check the inevitable movement,<br>and gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmful—gave<br>his approval, that is, to the accomplished fact.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>Bennigsen’s note and the Cossack’s information that the left flank<br>of the French was unguarded were merely final indications that it was<br>necessary to order an attack, and it was fixed for the fifth of October.<br><br>On the morning of the fourth of October Kutúzov signed the dispositions.<br>Toll read them to Ermólov, asking him to attend to the further<br>arrangements.<br><br>“All right—all right. I haven’t time just now,” replied Ermólov, and<br>left the hut.<br><br>The dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good. As in the Austerlitz<br>dispositions, it was written—though not in German this time:<br><br>“The First Column will march here and here,” “the Second Column will<br>march there and there,” and so on; and on paper, all these columns<br>arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy.<br>Everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions,<br>and as is always the case, not a single column reached its place at the<br>appointed time.<br><br>When the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been<br>prepared, an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to Ermólov<br>to deal with. A young officer of the Horse Guards, Kutúzov’s orderly,<br>pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him, went to<br>Ermólov’s quarters.<br><br>“Gone away,” said Ermólov’s orderly.<br><br>The officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom Ermólov was<br>often to be found.<br><br>“No, and the general’s out too.”<br><br>The officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.<br><br>“No, he’s gone out.”<br><br>“If only they don’t make me responsible for this delay! What a nuisance<br>it is!” thought the officer, and he rode round the whole camp. One man<br>said he had seen Ermólov ride past with some other generals, others said<br>he must have returned home. The officer searched till six o’clock in the<br>evening without even stopping to eat. Ermólov was nowhere to be found<br>and no one knew where he was. The officer snatched a little food at<br>a comrade’s, and rode again to the vanguard to find Milorádovich.<br>Milorádovich too was away, but here he was told that he had gone to a<br>ball at General Kíkin’s and that Ermólov was probably there too.<br><br>“But where is it?”<br><br>“Why, there, over at Échkino,” said a Cossack officer, pointing to a<br>country house in the far distance.<br><br>“What, outside our line?”<br><br>“They’ve put two regiments as outposts, and they’re having such a spree<br>there, it’s awful! Two bands and three sets of singers!”<br><br>The officer rode out beyond our lines to Échkino. While still at a<br>distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier’s dance song<br>proceeding from the house.<br><br>“In the meadows... in the meadows!” he heard, accompanied by whistling<br>and the sound of a torban, drowned every now and then by shouts. These<br>sounds made his spirits rise, but at the same time he was afraid that<br>he would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order<br>entrusted to him. It was already past eight o’clock. He dismounted<br>and went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained<br>intact between the Russian and French forces. In the refreshment room<br>and the hall, footmen were bustling about with wine and viands. Groups<br>of singers stood outside the windows. The officer was admitted and<br>immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together, and among<br>them Ermólov’s big imposing figure. They all had their coats unbuttoned<br>and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces,<br>laughing loudly. In the middle of the room a short handsome general with<br>a red face was dancing the trepák with much spirit and agility.<br><br>“Ha, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas Iványch! Ha, ha, ha!”<br><br>The officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment<br>he was doubly to blame, and he would have preferred to wait; but one of<br>the generals espied him and, hearing what he had come about, informed<br>Ermólov.<br><br>Ermólov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing what the<br>officer had to say, took the papers from him without a word.<br><br><br>“You think he went off just by chance?” said a comrade, who was on the<br>staff that evening, to the officer of the Horse Guards, referring to<br>Ermólov. “It was a trick. It was done on purpose to get Konovnítsyn into<br>trouble. You’ll see what a mess there’ll be tomorrow.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>Next day the decrepit Kutúzov, having given orders to be called early,<br>said his prayers, dressed, and, with an unpleasant consciousness of<br>having to direct a battle he did not approve of, got into his calèche<br>and drove from Letashóvka (a village three and a half miles from<br>Tarútino) to the place where the attacking columns were to meet. He sat<br>in the calèche, dozing and waking up by turns, and listening for any<br>sound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun.<br>But all was still quiet. A damp dull autumn morning was just dawning. On<br>approaching Tarútino Kutúzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to<br>water across the road along which he was driving. Kutúzov looked at<br>them searchingly, stopped his carriage, and inquired what regiment they<br>belonged to. They belonged to a column that should have been far in<br>front and in ambush long before then. “It may be a mistake,” thought<br>the old commander in chief. But a little further on he saw infantry<br>regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers, only partly dressed,<br>eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel. He sent for an officer. The<br>officer reported that no order to advance had been received.<br><br>“How! Not rec...” Kutúzov began, but checked himself immediately and<br>sent for a senior officer. Getting out of his calèche, he waited with<br>drooping head and breathing heavily, pacing silently up and down. When<br>Eýkhen, the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned, appeared,<br>Kutúzov went purple in the face, not because that officer was to blame<br>for the mistake, but because he was an object of sufficient importance<br>for him to vent his wrath on. Trembling and panting the old man fell<br>into that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the<br>ground, and he fell upon Eýkhen, threatening him with his hands,<br>shouting and loading him with gross abuse. Another man, Captain Brózin,<br>who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame, suffered the<br>same fate.<br><br>“What sort of another blackguard are you? I’ll have you shot!<br>Scoundrels!” yelled Kutúzov in a hoarse voice, waving his arms and<br>reeling.<br><br>He was suffering physically. He, the commander in chief, a Serene<br>Highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had<br>in Russia, to be placed in this position—made the laughingstock of the<br>whole army! “I needn’t have been in such a hurry to pray about today,<br>or have kept awake thinking everything over all night,” thought he to<br>himself. “When I was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to<br>mock me so... and now!” He was in a state of physical suffering as if<br>from corporal punishment, and could not avoid expressing it by cries of<br>anger and distress. But his strength soon began to fail him, and looking<br>about him, conscious of having said much that was amiss, he again got<br>into his calèche and drove back in silence.<br><br>His wrath, once expended, did not return, and blinking feebly he<br>listened to excuses and self-justifications (Ermólov did not come to see<br>him till the next day) and to the insistence of Bennigsen, Konovnítsyn,<br>and Toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next<br>day. And once more Kutúzov had to consent.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>Next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening<br>and advanced during the night. It was an autumn night with dark purple<br>clouds, but no rain. The ground was damp but not muddy, and the troops<br>advanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of the artillery<br>could be faintly heard. The men were forbidden to talk out loud, to<br>smoke their pipes, or to strike a light, and they tried to prevent their<br>horses neighing. The secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm<br>and they marched gaily. Some columns, supposing they had reached their<br>destination, halted, piled arms, and settled down on the cold ground,<br>but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they<br>evidently should not have been.<br><br>Only Count Orlóv-Denísov with his Cossacks (the least important<br>detachment of all) got to his appointed place at the right time. This<br>detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest, on the path leading from<br>the village of Stromílova to Dmítrovsk.<br><br>Toward dawn, Count Orlóv-Denísov, who had dozed off, was awakened by a<br>deserter from the French army being brought to him. This was a Polish<br>sergeant of Poniatowski’s corps, who explained in Polish that he had<br>come over because he had been slighted in the service: that he ought<br>long ago to have been made an officer, that he was braver than any of<br>them, and so he had left them and wished to pay them out. He said that<br>Murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were,<br>and that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would<br>capture him alive. Count Orlóv-Denísov consulted his fellow officers.<br><br>The offer was too tempting to be refused. Everyone volunteered to go and<br>everybody advised making the attempt. After much disputing and arguing,<br>Major-General Grékov with two Cossack regiments decided to go with the<br>Polish sergeant.<br><br>“Now, remember,” said Count Orlóv-Denísov to the sergeant at parting,<br>“if you have been lying I’ll have you hanged like a dog; but if it’s<br>true you shall have a hundred gold pieces!”<br><br>Without replying, the sergeant, with a resolute air, mounted and rode<br>away with Grékov whose men had quickly assembled. They disappeared into<br>the forest, and Count Orlóv-Denísov, having seen Grékov off, returned,<br>shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he<br>had undertaken on his own responsibility, and began looking at the enemy<br>camp, now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying<br>campfires. Our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open<br>declivity to his right. He looked in that direction, but though the<br>columns would have been visible quite far off, they were not to be seen.<br>It seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the French<br>camp, and his keen-sighted adjutant confirmed this.<br><br>“Oh, it is really too late,” said Count Orlóv, looking at the camp.<br><br>As often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before<br>our eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the<br>sergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, and that the whole Russian<br>attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments, which<br>he would lead away heaven only knew where. How could one capture a<br>commander in chief from among such a mass of troops!<br><br>“I am sure that rascal was lying,” said the count.<br><br>“They can still be called back,” said one of his suite, who like Count<br>Orlóv felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemy’s<br>camp.<br><br>“Eh? Really... what do you think? Should we let them go on or not?”<br><br>“Will you have them fetched back?”<br><br>“Fetch them back, fetch them back!” said Count Orlóv with sudden<br>determination, looking at his watch. “It will be too late. It is quite<br>light.”<br><br>And the adjutant galloped through the forest after Grékov. When Grékov<br>returned, Count Orlóv-Denísov, excited both by the abandoned attempt and<br>by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear, as<br>well as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved to advance. All his men<br>felt the same excitement.<br><br>“Mount!” he commanded in a whisper. The men took their places and<br>crossed themselves.... “Forward, with God’s aid!”<br><br>“Hurrah-ah-ah!” reverberated in the forest, and the Cossack companies,<br>trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out<br>of a sack, dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp.<br><br>One desperate, frightened yell from the first French soldier who saw the<br>Cossacks, and all who were in the camp, undressed and only just waking<br>up, ran off in all directions, abandoning cannons, muskets, and horses.<br><br>Had the Cossacks pursued the French, without heeding what was behind and<br>around them, they would have captured Murat and everything there.<br>That was what the officers desired. But it was impossible to make the<br>Cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners. None of them<br>listened to orders. Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight guns were<br>taken on the spot, besides standards and (what seemed most important to<br>the Cossacks) horses, saddles, horsecloths, and the like. All this had<br>to be dealt with, the prisoners and guns secured, the booty divided—not<br>without some shouting and even a little fighting among themselves—and it<br>was on this that the Cossacks all busied themselves.<br><br>The French, not being farther pursued, began to recover themselves: they<br>formed into detachments and began firing. Orlóv-Denísov, still waiting<br>for the other columns to arrive, advanced no further.<br><br>Meantime, according to the dispositions which said that “the First<br>Column will march” and so on, the infantry of the belated columns,<br>commanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started in due order<br>and, as always happens, had got somewhere, but not to their appointed<br>places. As always happens the men, starting cheerfully, began to halt;<br>murmurs were heard, there was a sense of confusion, and finally a<br>backward movement. Adjutants and generals galloped about, shouted, grew<br>angry, quarreled, said they had come quite wrong and were late, gave<br>vent to a little abuse, and at last gave it all up and went forward,<br>simply to get somewhere. “We shall get somewhere or other!” And they did<br>indeed get somewhere, though not to their right places; a few eventually<br>even got to their right place, but too late to be of any use and only<br>in time to be fired at. Toll, who in this battle played the part of<br>Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped assiduously from place to place,<br>finding everything upside down everywhere. Thus he stumbled on Bagovút’s<br>corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight, though the corps<br>should long before have joined Orlóv-Denísov. Excited and vexed by the<br>failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it, Toll<br>galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him<br>severely, saying that he ought to be shot. General Bagovút, a fighting<br>old soldier of placid temperament, being also upset by all the delay,<br>confusion, and cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody’s surprise<br>and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things<br>to Toll.<br><br>“I prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men as<br>well as anybody,” he said, and advanced with a single division.<br><br>Coming out onto a field under the enemy’s fire, this brave general went<br>straight ahead, leading his men under fire, without considering in his<br>agitation whether going into action now, with a single division, would<br>be of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets were just what he<br>needed in his angry mood. One of the first bullets killed him, and other<br>bullets killed many of his men. And his division remained under fire for<br>some time quite uselessly.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>Meanwhile another column was to have attacked the French from the front,<br>but Kutúzov accompanied that column. He well knew that nothing but<br>confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will, and as<br>far as was in his power held the troops back. He did not advance.<br><br>He rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering<br>suggestions that they should attack.<br><br>“The word attack is always on your tongue, but you don’t see that we are<br>unable to execute complicated maneuvers,” said he to Milorádovich who<br>asked permission to advance.<br><br>“We couldn’t take Murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in<br>time, and nothing can be done now!” he replied to someone else.<br><br>When Kutúzov was informed that at the French rear—where according to the<br>reports of the Cossacks there had previously been nobody—there were now<br>two battalions of Poles, he gave a sidelong glance at Ermólov who was<br>behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day.<br><br>“You see! They are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds,<br>but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready, and the enemy,<br>forewarned, takes measures accordingly.”<br><br>Ermólov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words.<br>He understood that for him the storm had blown over, and that Kutúzov<br>would content himself with that hint.<br><br>“He’s having a little fun at my expense,” said Ermólov softly, nudging<br>with his knee Raévski who was at his side.<br><br>Soon after this, Ermólov moved up to Kutúzov and respectfully remarked:<br><br>“It is not too late yet, your Highness—the enemy has not gone away—if<br>you were to order an attack! If not, the Guards will not so much as see<br>a little smoke.”<br><br>Kutúzov did not reply, but when they reported to him that Murat’s troops<br>were in retreat he ordered an advance, though at every hundred paces he<br>halted for three quarters of an hour.<br><br>The whole battle consisted in what Orlóv-Denísov’s Cossacks had done:<br>the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly.<br><br>In consequence of this battle Kutúzov received a diamond decoration,<br>and Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles, others also<br>received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades,<br>and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff.<br><br>“That’s how everything is done with us, all topsy-turvy!” said the<br>Russian officers and generals after the Tarútino battle, letting it be<br>understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that<br>we ourselves should not have done so, just as people speak today. But<br>people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about<br>or deliberately deceive themselves. No battle—Tarútino, Borodinó, or<br>Austerlitz—takes place as those who planned it anticipated. That is an<br>essential condition.<br><br>A countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer than during<br>a battle, where it is a question of life and death) influence the course<br>taken by the fight, and that course never can be known in advance and<br>never coincides with the direction of any one force.<br><br>If many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given<br>body, the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those<br>forces, but will always be a mean—what in mechanics is represented by<br>the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces.<br><br>If in the descriptions given by historians, especially French ones, we<br>find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously<br>formed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions<br>are false.<br><br>The battle of Tarútino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in<br>view—to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the<br>dispositions; nor that which Count Orlóv-Denísov may have had in view—to<br>take Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying the whole<br>corps, which Bennigsen and others may have had in view; nor the aim of<br>the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself; nor<br>that of the Cossack who wanted more booty than he got, and so on. But<br>if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the<br>Russians of that day desired—to drive the French out of Russia and<br>destroy their army—it is quite clear that the battle of Tarútino, just<br>because of its incongruities, was exactly what was wanted at that stage<br>of the campaign. It would be difficult and even impossible to imagine<br>any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle. With<br>a minimum of effort and insignificant losses, despite the greatest<br>confusion, the most important results of the whole campaign were<br>attained: the transition from retreat to advance, an exposure of the<br>weakness of the French, and the administration of that shock which<br>Napoleon’s army had only awaited to begin its flight.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>Napoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa; there<br>can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the<br>hands of the French. The Russians retreat and abandon their ancient<br>capital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and<br>incalculable wealth, is in Napoleon’s hands. The Russian army, only half<br>the strength of the French, does not make a single attempt to attack for<br>a whole month. Napoleon’s position is most brilliant. He can either fall<br>on the Russian army with double its strength and destroy it; negotiate<br>an advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on<br>Petersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse, return to Smolénsk or<br>Vílna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no special genius would seem to be<br>required to retain the brilliant position the French held at that time.<br>For that, only very simple and easy steps were necessary: not to allow<br>the troops to loot, to prepare winter clothing—of which there was<br>sufficient in Moscow for the whole army—and methodically to collect the<br>provisions, of which (according to the French historians) there were<br>enough in Moscow to supply the whole army for six months. Yet Napoleon,<br>that greatest of all geniuses, who the historians declare had control of<br>the army, took none of these steps.<br><br>He not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used his<br>power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open<br>to him. Of all that Napoleon might have done: wintering in Moscow,<br>advancing on Petersburg or on Nízhni-Nóvgorod, or retiring by a more<br>northerly or more southerly route (say by the road Kutúzov afterwards<br>took), nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he<br>actually did. He remained in Moscow till October, letting the troops<br>plunder the city; then, hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind<br>him, he quitted Moscow, approached Kutúzov without joining battle,<br>turned to the right and reached Málo-Yaroslávets, again without<br>attempting to break through and take the road Kutúzov took, but retiring<br>instead to Mozháysk along the devastated Smolénsk road. Nothing more<br>stupid than that could have been devised, or more disastrous for the<br>army, as the sequel showed. Had Napoleon’s aim been to destroy his army,<br>the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series<br>of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose,<br>independently of anything the Russian army might do.<br><br>Napoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he destroyed his<br>army because he wished to, or because he was very stupid, would be as<br>unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to Moscow because he<br>wished to and because he was very clever and a genius.<br><br>In both cases his personal activity, having no more force than the<br>personal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws that<br>guided the event.<br><br>The historians quite falsely represent Napoleon’s faculties as having<br>weakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results did not justify<br>his actions. He employed all his ability and strength to do the best he<br>could for himself and his army, as he had done previously and as he did<br>subsequently in 1813. His activity at that time was no less astounding<br>than it was in Egypt, in Italy, in Austria, and in Prussia. We do not<br>know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in Egypt—where forty<br>centuries looked down upon his grandeur—for his great exploits there are<br>all told us by Frenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his genius in<br>Austria or Prussia, for we have to draw our information from French<br>or German sources, and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps<br>without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline Germans<br>to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on<br>in Germany. But we, thank God, have no need to recognize his genius<br>in order to hide our shame. We have paid for the right to look at the<br>matter plainly and simply, and we will not abandon that right.<br><br>His activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as<br>elsewhere. Order after order and plan after plan were issued by him<br>from the time he entered Moscow till the time he left it. The absence<br>of citizens and of a deputation, and even the burning of Moscow, did not<br>disconcert him. He did not lose sight either of the welfare of his<br>army or of the doings of the enemy, or of the welfare of the people<br>of Russia, or of the direction of affairs in Paris, or of diplomatic<br>considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>With regard to military matters, Napoleon immediately on his entry into<br>Moscow gave General Sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements<br>of the Russian army, sent army corps out along the different roads, and<br>charged Murat to find Kutúzov. Then he gave careful directions about the<br>fortification of the Krémlin, and drew up a brilliant plan for a future<br>campaign over the whole map of Russia.<br><br>With regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain Yákovlev,<br>who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of<br>Moscow, minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity,<br>and having written a letter to the Emperor Alexander in which he<br>considered it his duty to inform his Friend and Brother that Rostopchín<br>had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he dispatched Yákovlev to<br>Petersburg.<br><br>Having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to Tutólmin, he<br>dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate.<br><br>With regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave orders<br>to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel Rostopchín was<br>punished by an order to burn down his houses.<br><br>With regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a<br>constitution. A municipality was established and the following<br>announcement issued:<br><br><br>INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW!<br><br>Your misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King<br>desires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you how he<br>punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been taken to<br>put an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A<br>paternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form your<br>municipality or city government. It will take care of you, of your<br>needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished by a red<br>ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear<br>a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only wear a red<br>ribbon round the left arm.<br><br>The city police is established on its former footing, and better order<br>already prevails in consequence of its activity. The government has<br>appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of police, and twenty<br>commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different<br>wards of the city. You will recognize them by the white ribbon they will<br>wear on the left arm. Several churches of different denominations are<br>open, and divine service is performed in them unhindered. Your fellow<br>citizens are returning every day to their homes and orders have been<br>given that they should find in them the help and protection due to<br>their misfortunes. These are the measures the government has adopted to<br>re-establish order and relieve your condition. But to achieve this<br>aim it is necessary that you should add your efforts and should, if<br>possible, forget the misfortunes you have suffered, should entertain<br>the hope of a less cruel fate, should be certain that inevitable and<br>ignominious death awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or<br>on what remains of your property, and finally that you should not doubt<br>that these will be safeguarded, since such is the will of the greatest<br>and most just of monarchs. Soldiers and citizens, of whatever nation you<br>may be, re-establish public confidence, the source of the welfare of<br>a state, live like brothers, render mutual aid and protection one to<br>another, unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the<br>military and civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to flow!<br><br><br>With regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that all the<br>troops in turn should enter Moscow à la maraude * to obtain provisions<br>for themselves, so that the army might have its future provided for.<br><br>    * As looters.<br><br>With regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back<br>and services to be again performed in the churches.<br><br>With regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the following was<br>placarded everywhere:<br><br>PROCLAMATION<br><br>You, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen whom<br>misfortune has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers of<br>the soil, still kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen!<br>Tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in<br>it. Your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places<br>on finding that they are respected. Any violence to them or to their<br>property is promptly punished. His Majesty the Emperor and King protects<br>them, and considers no one among you his enemy except those who disobey<br>his orders. He desires to end your misfortunes and restore you to your<br>homes and families. Respond, therefore, to his benevolent intentions<br>and come to us without fear. Inhabitants, return with confidence to your<br>abodes! You will soon find means of satisfying your needs. Craftsmen<br>and industrious artisans, return to your work, your houses, your shops,<br>where the protection of guards awaits you! You shall receive proper pay<br>for your work. And lastly you too, peasants, come from the forests where<br>you are hiding in terror, return to your huts without fear, in full<br>assurance that you will find protection! Markets are established in the<br>city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the products of<br>the soil. The government has taken the following steps to ensure freedom<br>of sale for them: (1) From today, peasants, husbandmen, and those<br>living in the neighborhood of Moscow may without any danger bring their<br>supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets, of which one is on<br>the Mokhováya Street and the other at the Provision Market. (2) Such<br>supplies will be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may<br>agree on, and if a seller is unable to obtain a fair price he will be<br>free to take his goods back to his village and no one may hinder him<br>under any pretense. (3) Sunday and Wednesday of each week are appointed<br>as the chief market days and to that end a sufficient number of troops<br>will be stationed along the highroads on Tuesdays and Saturdays at such<br>distances from the town as to protect the carts. (4) Similar measures<br>will be taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no<br>hindrance on their return journey. (5) Steps will immediately be taken<br>to re-establish ordinary trading.<br><br>Inhabitants of the city and villages, and you, workingmen and artisans,<br>to whatever nation you belong, you are called on to carry out the<br>paternal intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King and to<br>co-operate with him for the public welfare! Lay your respect and<br>confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us!<br><br><br>With the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people,<br>reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed. The Emperor<br>rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and, despite his<br>preoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the theaters that were<br>established by his order.<br><br>In regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned heads,<br>Napoleon also did all in his power. He caused the words Maison de ma<br>Mère to be inscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining<br>tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. He<br>visited the Foundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by him<br>to kiss his white hands, graciously conversed with Tutólmin. Then, as<br>Thiers eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged<br>Russian money which he had prepared: “Raising the use of these means<br>by an act worthy of himself and of the French army, he let relief<br>be distributed to those who had been burned out. But as food was too<br>precious to be given to foreigners, who were for the most part enemies,<br>Napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to purchase food<br>from outside, and had paper rubles distributed to them.”<br><br>With reference to army discipline, orders were continually being issued<br>to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties<br>and to suppress robbery.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>But strange to say, all these measures, efforts, and plans—which were<br>not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances—did not<br>affect the essence of the matter but, like the hands of a clock detached<br>from the mechanism, swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without<br>engaging the cogwheels.<br><br>With reference to the military side—the plan of campaign—that work of<br>genius of which Thiers remarks that, “His genius never devised anything<br>more profound, more skillful, or more admirable,” and enters into a<br>polemic with M. Fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred<br>not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of October—that plan never was or<br>could be executed, for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the<br>case. The fortifying of the Krémlin, for which la Mosquée (as Napoleon<br>termed the church of Basil the Beatified) was to have been razed to<br>the ground, proved quite useless. The mining of the Krémlin only helped<br>toward fulfilling Napoleon’s wish that it should be blown up when he<br>left Moscow—as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to<br>be beaten. The pursuit of the Russian army, about which Napoleon was so<br>concerned, produced an unheard-of result. The French generals lost touch<br>with the Russian army of sixty thousand men, and according to Thiers it<br>was only eventually found, like a lost pin, by the skill—and apparently<br>the genius—of Murat.<br><br>With reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon’s arguments as to his<br>magnanimity and justice, both to Tutólmin and to Yákovlev (whose chief<br>concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless;<br>Alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their<br>embassage.<br><br>With regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed<br>incendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down.<br><br>With regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a<br>municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain<br>people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of<br>preserving order looted Moscow or saved their own property from being<br>looted.<br><br>With regard to religion, as to which in Egypt matters had so easily been<br>settled by Napoleon’s visit to a mosque, no results were achieved.<br>Two or three priests who were found in Moscow did try to carry out<br>Napoleon’s wish, but one of them was slapped in the face by a French<br>soldier while conducting service, and a French official reported of<br>another that: “The priest whom I found and invited to say Mass cleaned<br>and locked up the church. That night the doors were again broken<br>open, the padlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and other disorders<br>perpetrated.”<br><br>With reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious workmen and<br>to peasants evoked no response. There were no industrious workmen, and<br>the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town<br>with the proclamation and killed them.<br><br>As to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops,<br>these did not meet with success either. The theaters set up in the<br>Krémlin and in Posnyákov’s house were closed again at once because the<br>actors and actresses were robbed.<br><br>Even philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as<br>well as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The<br>French, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the<br>paper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to the<br>unfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold.<br><br>But the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given<br>by the authorities at that time was Napoleon’s attempt to stop the<br>looting and re-establish discipline.<br><br>This is what the army authorities were reporting:<br><br>“Looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order<br>is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a<br>lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, and they sell stolen<br>goods.”<br><br>“The neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of<br>the 3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate<br>inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left, even have<br>the ferocity to wound them with their sabers, as I have repeatedly<br>witnessed.”<br><br>“Nothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging—October<br>9.”<br><br>“Robbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves in our<br>district who ought to be arrested by a strong force—October 11.”<br><br>“The Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to<br>stop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually seen returning<br>to the Krémlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and pillage were renewed<br>more violently than ever yesterday evening, last night, and today. The<br>Emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his<br>person, who should set an example of discipline, carry disobedience to<br>such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army<br>supplies. Others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying<br>sentinels and officers, and have abused and beaten them.”<br><br>“The Grand Marshal of the palace,” wrote the governor, “complains<br>bitterly that in spite of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to<br>commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows<br>of the Emperor.”<br><br>That army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the<br>provender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated and<br>perished with each additional day it remained in Moscow. But it did not<br>go away.<br><br>It began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the<br>capture of transport trains on the Smolénsk road, and by the battle of<br>Tarútino. The news of that battle of Tarútino, unexpectedly received<br>by Napoleon at a review, evoked in him a desire to punish the Russians<br>(Thiers says), and he issued the order for departure which the whole<br>army was demanding.<br><br>Fleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had<br>stolen. Napoleon, too, carried away his own personal trésor, but on<br>seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army, he was (Thiers says)<br>horror-struck. And yet with his experience of war he did not order all<br>the superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he had done with those of a<br>certain marshal when approaching Moscow. He gazed at the calèches and<br>carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very<br>good thing, as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions, the<br>sick, and the wounded.<br><br>The plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which<br>feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. To study the<br>skillful tactics and aims of Napoleon and his army from the time it<br>entered Moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps<br>and shudders of a mortally wounded animal. Very often a wounded animal,<br>hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunter’s gun, runs forward and<br>back again, and hastens its own end. Napoleon, under pressure from his<br>whole army, did the same thing. The rustle of the battle of Tarútino<br>frightened the beast, and it rushed forward onto the hunter’s gun,<br>reached him, turned back, and finally—like any wild beast—ran back along<br>the most disadvantageous and dangerous path, where the old scent was<br>familiar.<br><br>During the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have been<br>the leader of all these movements—as the figurehead of a ship may seem<br>to a savage to guide the vessel—acted like a child who, holding a couple<br>of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>Early in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out of the<br>shed, and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little<br>blue-gray dog, with a long body and short bandy legs, that jumped about<br>him. This little dog lived in their shed, sleeping beside Karatáev at<br>night; it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned<br>again. Probably it had never had an owner, and it still belonged to<br>nobody and had no name. The French called it Azor; the soldier who<br>told stories called it Femgálka; Karatáev and others called it Gray, or<br>sometimes Flabby. Its lack of a master, a name, or even of a breed or<br>any definite color did not seem to trouble the blue-gray dog in the<br>least. Its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plume, its bandy legs<br>served it so well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run<br>very easily and quickly on three legs, as if disdaining to use all<br>four. Everything pleased it. Now it would roll on its back, yelping with<br>delight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance, and<br>now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw.<br><br>Pierre’s attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only<br>remnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldier’s trousers which by<br>Karatáev’s advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and<br>a peasant coat and cap. Physically he had changed much during this<br>time. He no longer seemed stout, though he still had the appearance of<br>solidity and strength hereditary in his family. A beard and mustache<br>covered the lower part of his face, and a tangle of hair, infested<br>with lice, curled round his head like a cap. The look of his eyes<br>was resolute, calm, and animatedly alert, as never before. The former<br>slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an<br>energetic readiness for action and resistance. His feet were bare.<br><br>Pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen<br>were passing that morning, then into the distance across the river, then<br>at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him,<br>and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various<br>positions, moving his dirty thick big toes. Every time he looked at his<br>bare feet a smile of animated self-satisfaction flitted across his face.<br>The sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned<br>during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him.<br><br>For some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in<br>the mornings—what is called an “old wives’ summer.”<br><br>In the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly<br>pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in<br>the air.<br><br>On everything—far and near—lay the magic crystal glitter seen only at<br>that time of autumn. The Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance,<br>with the village, the church, and the large white house. The bare trees,<br>the sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, the green church spire,<br>and the corners of the white house in the distance, all stood out in the<br>transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness.<br>Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half-burned mansion<br>occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still showing dark green<br>beside the fence. And even that ruined and befouled house—which in dull<br>weather was repulsively ugly—seemed quietly beautiful now, in the clear,<br>motionless brilliance.<br><br>A French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a skullcap on<br>his head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from behind a corner of<br>the shed and approached Pierre with a friendly wink.<br><br>“What sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!” (Their name for Pierre.) “Eh? Just like<br>spring!”<br><br>And the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his pipe,<br>though whenever he offered it Pierre always declined it.<br><br>“To be on the march in such weather...” he began.<br><br>Pierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the corporal told<br>him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an<br>order about the prisoners that day. Sokolóv, one of the soldiers in the<br>shed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre told the corporal that something<br>should be done about him. The corporal replied that Pierre need not<br>worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and<br>arrangements would be made for the sick, and that in general everything<br>that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities.<br><br>“Besides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word to the captain,<br>you know. He is a man who never forgets anything. Speak to the captain<br>when he makes his round, he will do anything for you.”<br><br>(The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with Pierre<br>and showed him all sorts of favors.)<br><br>“‘You see, St. Thomas,’ he said to me the other day. ‘Monsieur Kiril is<br>a man of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who has<br>had misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows what’s what.... If he wants<br>anything and asks me, he won’t get a refusal. When one has studied, you<br>see, one likes education and well-bred people.’ It is for your sake I<br>mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if it had not been for you<br>that affair would have ended ill.”<br><br>And after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. (The affair<br>he had alluded to had happened a few days before—a fight between the<br>prisoners and the French soldiers, in which Pierre had succeeded in<br>pacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had heard Pierre<br>talking to the corporal immediately asked what the Frenchman had said.<br>While Pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving<br>Moscow, a thin, sallow, tattered French soldier came up to the door of<br>the shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way<br>of greeting, he asked Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to whom he had<br>given a shirt to sew was in that shed.<br><br>A week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to them,<br>which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and<br>shirts for them.<br><br>“Ready, ready, dear fellow!” said Karatáev, coming out with a neatly<br>folded shirt.<br><br>Karatáev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work,<br>was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot. His<br>hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree bast,<br>and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever.<br><br>“A promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here it is,<br>ready,” said Platón, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn.<br><br>The Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his<br>hesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. He had<br>a long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, thin bare<br>body, but no shirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on<br>would laugh at him, and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly. None<br>of the prisoners said a word.<br><br>“See, it fits well!” Platón kept repeating, pulling the shirt straight.<br><br>The Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without raising<br>his eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.<br><br>“You see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I had no proper<br>tools; and, as they say, one needs a tool even to kill a louse,” said<br>Platón with one of his round smiles, obviously pleased with his work.<br><br>“It’s good, quite good, thank you,” said the Frenchman, in French, “but<br>there must be some linen left over.”<br><br>“It will fit better still when it sets to your body,” said Karatáev,<br>still admiring his handiwork. “You’ll be nice and comfortable....”<br><br>“Thanks, thanks, old fellow.... But the bits left over?” said the<br>Frenchman again and smiled. He took out an assignation ruble note and<br>gave it to Karatáev. “But give me the pieces that are over.”<br><br>Pierre saw that Platón did not want to understand what the Frenchman<br>was saying, and he looked on without interfering. Karatáev thanked the<br>Frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work. The Frenchman<br>insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked<br>Pierre to translate what he said.<br><br>“What does he want the bits for?” said Karatáev. “They’d make fine leg<br>bands for us. Well, never mind.”<br><br>And Karatáev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression, took<br>a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the<br>Frenchman without looking at him. “Oh dear!” muttered Karatáev and went<br>away. The Frenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment, then<br>looked inquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierre’s look had told him<br>something, suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:<br><br>“Platoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!” And handing back the odd<br>bits he turned and went out.<br><br>“There, look at that,” said Karatáev, swaying his head. “People said<br>they were not Christians, but they too have souls. It’s what the old<br>folk used to say: ‘A sweating hand’s an open hand, a dry hand’s close.’<br>He’s naked, but yet he’s given it back.”<br><br>Karatáev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the<br>pieces.<br><br>“But they’ll make grand leg bands, dear friend,” he said, and went back<br>into the shed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>Four weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner and though<br>the French had offered to move him from the men’s to the officers’ shed,<br>he had stayed in the shed where he was first put.<br><br>In burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost the extreme<br>limits of privation a man can endure; but thanks to his physical<br>strength and health, of which he had till then been unconscious, and<br>thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that<br>it was impossible to say when they began, he endured his position<br>not only lightly but joyfully. And just at this time he obtained the<br>tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach.<br>He had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind, that<br>inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle<br>of Borodinó. He had sought it in philanthropy, in Freemasonry, in the<br>dissipations of town life, in wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice,<br>and in romantic love for Natásha; he had sought it by reasoning—and all<br>these quests and experiments had failed him. And now without thinking<br>about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the<br>horror of death, through privation, and through what he recognized in<br>Karatáev.<br><br>Those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it<br>were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating<br>thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important. It did<br>not now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or politics, or<br>Napoleon. It was plain to him that all these things were no business<br>of his, and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and<br>therefore could not do so. “Russia and summer weather are not bound<br>together,” he thought, repeating words of Karatáev’s which he found<br>strangely consoling. His intention of killing Napoleon and his<br>calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the Apocalypse now<br>seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous. His anger with his wife<br>and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely<br>trivial but even amusing. What concern was it of his that somewhere or<br>other that woman was leading the life she preferred? What did it matter<br>to anybody, and especially to him, whether or not they found out that<br>their prisoner’s name was Count Bezúkhov?<br><br>He now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and quite<br>agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrew’s thoughts somewhat<br>differently. Prince Andrew had thought and said that happiness could<br>only be negative, but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony<br>as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is<br>implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied. But Pierre<br>believed it without any mental reservation. The absence of suffering,<br>the satisfaction of one’s needs and consequent freedom in the choice of<br>one’s occupation, that is, of one’s way of life, now seemed to Pierre to<br>be indubitably man’s highest happiness. Here and now for the first time<br>he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat,<br>drinking when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of<br>warmth when he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to<br>talk and to hear a human voice. The satisfaction of one’s needs—good<br>food, cleanliness, and freedom—now that he was deprived of all this,<br>seemed to Pierre to constitute perfect happiness; and the choice<br>of occupation, that is, of his way of life—now that that was so<br>restricted—seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a<br>superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying one’s<br>needs, while great freedom in the choice of occupation—such freedom as<br>his wealth, his education, and his social position had given him in his<br>own life—is just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult<br>and destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation.<br><br>All Pierre’s daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free. Yet<br>subsequently, and for the rest of his life, he thought and spoke with<br>enthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those irrecoverable, strong,<br>joyful sensations, and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner<br>freedom which he experienced only during those weeks.<br><br>When on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed at dawn, and<br>saw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin still dark<br>at first, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, the Sparrow Hills, and the<br>wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance,<br>when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the<br>crows flying from Moscow across the field, and when afterwards light<br>gleamed from the east and the sun’s rim appeared solemnly from behind a<br>cloud, and the cupolas and crosses, the hoarfrost, the distance and the<br>river, all began to sparkle in the glad light—Pierre felt a new joy and<br>strength in life such as he had never before known. And this not only<br>stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment, but even grew in<br>strength as the hardships of his position increased.<br><br>That feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still<br>further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners<br>formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed. With his knowledge<br>of languages, the respect shown him by the French, his simplicity, his<br>readiness to give anything asked of him (he received the allowance<br>of three rubles a week made to officers); with his strength, which he<br>showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut; his<br>gentleness to his companions, and his capacity for sitting still and<br>thinking without doing anything (which seemed to them incomprehensible),<br>he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being. The very<br>qualities that had been a hindrance, if not actually harmful, to him in<br>the world he had lived in—his strength, his disdain for the comforts of<br>life, his absent-mindedness and simplicity—here among these people gave<br>him almost the status of a hero. And Pierre felt that their opinion<br>placed responsibilities upon him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>The French evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh<br>of October: kitchens and sheds were dismantled, carts loaded, and troops<br>and baggage trains started.<br><br>At seven in the morning a French convoy in marching trim, wearing shakos<br>and carrying muskets, knapsacks, and enormous sacks, stood in front<br>of the sheds, and animated French talk mingled with curses sounded all<br>along the lines.<br><br>In the shed everyone was ready, dressed, belted, shod, and only awaited<br>the order to start. The sick soldier, Sokolóv, pale and thin with dark<br>shadows round his eyes, alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed.<br>His eyes, prominent from the emaciation of his face, gazed inquiringly<br>at his comrades who were paying no attention to him, and he moaned<br>regularly and quietly. It was evidently not so much his sufferings that<br>caused him to moan (he had dysentery) as his fear and grief at being<br>left alone.<br><br>Pierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes Karatáev had<br>made for him from some leather a French soldier had torn off a tea chest<br>and brought to have his boots mended with, went up to the sick man and<br>squatted down beside him.<br><br>“You know, Sokolóv, they are not all going away! They have a hospital<br>here. You may be better off than we others,” said Pierre.<br><br>“O Lord! Oh, it will be the death of me! O Lord!” moaned the man in a<br>louder voice.<br><br>“I’ll go and ask them again directly,” said Pierre, rising and going to<br>the door of the shed.<br><br>Just as Pierre reached the door, the corporal who had offered him a<br>pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers. The corporal and<br>soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal<br>straps, and these changed their familiar faces.<br><br>The corporal came, according to orders, to shut the door. The prisoners<br>had to be counted before being let out.<br><br>“Corporal, what will they do with the sick man?...” Pierre began.<br><br>But even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal<br>he knew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that<br>moment. Moreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums<br>was suddenly heard from both sides. The corporal frowned at Pierre’s<br>words and, uttering some meaningless oaths, slammed the door. The shed<br>became semidark, and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned<br>the sick man’s groans.<br><br>“There it is!... It again!...” said Pierre to himself, and an<br>involuntary shudder ran down his spine. In the corporal’s changed face,<br>in the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise of the<br>drums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which compelled<br>people against their will to kill their fellow men—that force the effect<br>of which he had witnessed during the executions. To fear or to try to<br>escape that force, to address entreaties or exhortations to those who<br>served as its tools, was useless. Pierre knew this now. One had to wait<br>and endure. He did not again go to the sick man, nor turn to look at<br>him, but stood frowning by the door of the hut.<br><br>When that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one<br>another like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed<br>his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had<br>assured him was ready to do anything for him. The captain was also in<br>marching kit, and on his cold face appeared that same it which Pierre<br>had recognized in the corporal’s words and in the roll of the drums.<br><br>“Pass on, pass on!” the captain reiterated, frowning sternly, and<br>looking at the prisoners who thronged past him.<br><br>Pierre went up to him, though he knew his attempt would be vain.<br><br>“What now?” the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing<br>Pierre.<br><br>Pierre told him about the sick man.<br><br>“He’ll manage to walk, devil take him!” said the captain. “Pass on, pass<br>on!” he continued without looking at Pierre.<br><br>“But he is dying,” Pierre again began.<br><br>“Be so good...” shouted the captain, frowning angrily.<br><br>“Dram-da-da-dam, dam-dam...” rattled the drums, and Pierre understood<br>that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it<br>was now useless to say any more.<br><br>The officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march<br>in front. There were about thirty officers, with Pierre among them, and<br>about three hundred men.<br><br>The officers, who had come from the other sheds, were all strangers to<br>Pierre and much better dressed than he. They looked at him and at his<br>shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him walked a fat major<br>with a sallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing a Kazán dressing<br>gown tied round with a towel, and who evidently enjoyed the respect of<br>his fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in which he clasped his tobacco<br>pouch, inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his<br>pipe firmly with the other. Panting and puffing, the major grumbled and<br>growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that<br>they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were<br>all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at.<br>Another, a thin little officer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing<br>where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day. An<br>official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from<br>side to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his<br>observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part<br>of the city was that they could see. A third officer, who by his accent<br>was a Pole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was<br>mistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow.<br><br>“What are you disputing about?” said the major angrily. “What does it<br>matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it’s burned<br>down, and there’s an end of it.... What are you pushing for? Isn’t the<br>road wide enough?” said he, turning to a man behind him who was not<br>pushing him at all.<br><br>“Oh, oh, oh! What have they done?” the prisoners on one side and another<br>were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. “All beyond the<br>river, and Zúbova, and in the Krémlin.... Just look! There’s not half of<br>it left. Yes, I told you—the whole quarter beyond the river, and so it<br>is.”<br><br>“Well, you know it’s burned, so what’s the use of talking?” said the<br>major.<br><br>As they passed near a church in the Khamóvniki (one of the few unburned<br>quarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one<br>side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard.<br><br>“Ah, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is... And<br>smeared with something!”<br><br>Pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these<br>exclamations, and dimly made out something leaning against the palings<br>surrounding the church. From the words of his comrades who saw better<br>than he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set upright<br>against the palings with its face smeared with soot.<br><br>“Go on! What the devil... Go on! Thirty thousand devils!...” the convoy<br>guards began cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh virulence,<br>drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at<br>the dead man.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>Through the cross streets of the Khamóvniki quarter the prisoners<br>marched, followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons<br>belonging to that escort, but when they reached the supply stores they<br>came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with<br>private vehicles.<br><br>At the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front to get across.<br>From the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage<br>trains before and behind them. To the right, where the Kalúga road turns<br>near Neskúchny, endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into<br>the distance. These were troops of Beauharnais’ corps which had started<br>before any of the others. Behind, along the riverside and across the<br>Stone Bridge, were Ney’s troops and transport.<br><br>Davout’s troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing the<br>Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kalúga road.<br>But the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of Beauharnais’<br>train had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the Kalúga road when<br>the vanguard of Ney’s army was already emerging from the Great Ordýnka<br>Street.<br><br>When they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps<br>forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles and men<br>crowded closer and closer together. They advanced the few hundred paces<br>that separated the bridge from the Kalúga road, taking more than an<br>hour to do so, and came out upon the square where the streets of the<br>Transmoskvá ward and the Kalúga road converge, and the prisoners jammed<br>close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway. From all<br>sides, like the roar of the sea, were heard the rattle of wheels, the<br>tramp of feet, and incessant shouts of anger and abuse. Pierre stood<br>pressed against the wall of a charred house, listening to that noise<br>which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums.<br><br>To get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of<br>the half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.<br><br>“What crowds! Just look at the crowds!... They’ve loaded goods even on<br>the cannon! Look there, those are furs!” they exclaimed. “Just see what<br>the blackguards have looted.... There! See what that one has behind<br>in the cart.... Why, those are settings taken from some icons, by<br>heaven!... Oh, the rascals!... See how that fellow has loaded<br>himself up, he can hardly walk! Good lord, they’ve even grabbed those<br>chaises!... See that fellow there sitting on the trunks.... Heavens!<br>They’re fighting.”<br><br>“That’s right, hit him on the snout—on his snout! Like this, we<br>shan’t get away before evening. Look, look there.... Why, that must be<br>Napoleon’s own. See what horses! And the monograms with a crown! It’s<br>like a portable house.... That fellow’s dropped his sack and doesn’t see<br>it. Fighting again... A woman with a baby, and not bad-looking either!<br>Yes, I dare say, that’s the way they’ll let you pass.... Just look,<br>there’s no end to it. Russian wenches, by heaven, so they are! In<br>carriages—see how comfortably they’ve settled themselves!”<br><br>Again, as at the church in Khamóvniki, a wave of general curiosity<br>bore all the prisoners forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to<br>his stature, saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their<br>curiosity. In three carriages involved among the munition carts, closely<br>squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed in glaring<br>colors, who were shouting something in shrill voices.<br><br>From the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious<br>force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the corpse<br>smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned<br>ruins of Moscow. All that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression<br>on him—as if his soul, making ready for a hard struggle, refused to<br>receive impressions that might weaken it.<br><br>The women’s vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts, soldiers,<br>wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts,<br>more soldiers, and now and then women.<br><br>Pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement.<br><br>All these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible<br>power. During the hour Pierre watched them they all came flowing from<br>the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly;<br>they all jostled one another, began to grow angry and to fight, white<br>teeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the same words of abuse flew from<br>side to side, and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute<br>and coldly cruel expression that had struck Pierre that morning on the<br>corporal’s face when the drums were beating.<br><br>It was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort<br>collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among<br>the baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all sides, emerged<br>onto the Kalúga road.<br><br>They marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only when the sun<br>began to set. The baggage carts drew up close together and the men<br>began to prepare for their night’s rest. They all appeared angry and<br>dissatisfied. For a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could<br>be heard from all sides. A carriage that followed the escort ran<br>into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole. Several<br>soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides: some beat the<br>carriage horses on their heads, turning them aside, others fought among<br>themselves, and Pierre saw that one German was badly wounded on the head<br>by a sword.<br><br>It seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped amid fields<br>in the chill dusk of the autumn evening, experienced one and the same<br>feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on<br>that had seized them at the start. Once at a standstill they all seemed<br>to understand that they did not yet know where they were going, and that<br>much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey.<br><br>During this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they<br>had done at the start. It was here that the prisoners for the first time<br>received horseflesh for their meat ration.<br><br>From the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like<br>personal spite against each of the prisoners, in unexpected contrast to<br>their former friendly relations.<br><br>This spite increased still more when, on calling over the roll of<br>prisoners, it was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one Russian<br>soldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, had escaped. Pierre saw<br>a Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from<br>the road, and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to<br>court-martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the<br>Russian. To the noncommissioned officer’s excuse that the prisoner was<br>ill and could not walk, the officer replied that the order was to shoot<br>those who lagged behind. Pierre felt that that fatal force which had<br>crushed him during the executions, but which he had not felt during his<br>imprisonment, now again controlled his existence. It was terrible, but<br>he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush<br>him, there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent<br>of it.<br><br>He ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his<br>comrades.<br><br>Neither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in<br>Moscow, or of the roughness of their treatment by the French, or of the<br>order to shoot them which had been announced to them. As if in reaction<br>against the worsening of their position they were all particularly<br>animated and gay. They spoke of personal reminiscences, of amusing<br>scenes they had witnessed during the campaign, and avoided all talk of<br>their present situation.<br><br>The sun had set long since. Bright stars shone out here and there in the<br>sky. A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the<br>rising full moon, and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray<br>haze. It grew light. The evening was ending, but the night had not yet<br>come. Pierre got up and left his new companions, crossing between the<br>campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the<br>common soldier prisoners were stationed. He wanted to talk to them. On<br>the road he was stopped by a French sentinel who ordered him back.<br><br>Pierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an<br>unharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his legs under him and<br>dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the<br>cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought. Suddenly he<br>burst out into a fit of his broad, good-natured laughter, so loud that<br>men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and<br>evidently solitary laughter could mean.<br><br>“Ha-ha-ha!” laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to himself: “The soldier<br>did not let me pass. They took me and shut me up. They hold me captive.<br>What, me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...” and he laughed<br>till tears started to his eyes.<br><br>A man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at<br>all by himself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went farther away from<br>the inquisitive man, and looked around him.<br><br>The huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the<br>crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the<br>red campfires were growing paler and dying down. High up in the light<br>sky hung the full moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp, unseen<br>before, were now visible in the distance. And farther still, beyond<br>those forests and fields, the bright, oscillating, limitless distance<br>lured one to itself. Pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling<br>stars in its faraway depths. “And all that is me, all that is within me,<br>and it is all I!” thought Pierre. “And they caught all that and put it<br>into a shed boarded up with planks!” He smiled, and went and lay down to<br>sleep beside his companions.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>In the early days of October another envoy came to Kutúzov with a letter<br>from Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from Moscow, though<br>Napoleon was already not far from Kutúzov on the old Kalúga road.<br>Kutúzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly<br>brought by Lauriston, saying that there could be no question of peace.<br><br>Soon after that a report was received from Dórokhov’s guerrilla<br>detachment operating to the left of Tarútino that troops of Broussier’s<br>division had been seen at Formínsk and that being separated from the<br>rest of the French army they might easily be destroyed. The soldiers and<br>officers again demanded action. Generals on the staff, excited by the<br>memory of the easy victory at Tarútino, urged Kutúzov to carry out<br>Dórokhov’s suggestion. Kutúzov did not consider any offensive necessary.<br>The result was a compromise which was inevitable: a small detachment was<br>sent to Formínsk to attack Broussier.<br><br>By a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most<br>difficult and important one, was entrusted to Dokhtúrov—that same modest<br>little Dokhtúrov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans<br>of battles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering crosses on<br>batteries, and so on, and who was thought to be and was spoken of as<br>undecided and undiscerning—but whom we find commanding wherever the<br>position was most difficult all through the Russo-French wars from<br>Austerlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz he remained last at the<br>Augezd dam, rallying the regiments, saving what was possible when all<br>were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear<br>guard. Ill with fever he went to Smolénsk with twenty thousand men<br>to defend the town against Napoleon’s whole army. In Smolénsk, at the<br>Malákhov Gate, he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he<br>was awakened by the bombardment of the town—and Smolénsk held out all<br>day long. At the battle of Borodinó, when Bagratión was killed and nine<br>tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the<br>French artillery fire was directed against it, the man sent there was<br>this same irresolute and undiscerning Dokhtúrov—Kutúzov hastening to<br>rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first.<br>And the quiet little Dokhtúrov rode thither, and Borodinó became the<br>greatest glory of the Russian army. Many heroes have been described to<br>us in verse and prose, but of Dokhtúrov scarcely a word has been said.<br><br>It was Dokhtúrov again whom they sent to Formínsk and from there to<br>Málo-Yaroslávets, the place where the last battle with the French was<br>fought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army began;<br>and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the<br>campaign, but of Dokhtúrov nothing or very little is said and that<br>dubiously. And this silence about Dokhtúrov is the clearest testimony to<br>his merit.<br><br>It is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a<br>machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance<br>and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most<br>important part. The man who does not understand the construction of<br>the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which<br>revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine, and<br>not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working.<br><br>On the tenth of October when Dokhtúrov had gone halfway to Formínsk and<br>stopped at the village of Aristóvo, preparing faithfully to execute the<br>orders he had received, the whole French army having, in its convulsive<br>movement, reached Murat’s position apparently in order to give<br>battle—suddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new<br>Kalúga road and began to enter Formínsk, where only Broussier had<br>been till then. At that time Dokhtúrov had under his command, besides<br>Dórokhov’s detachment, the two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and<br>Seslávin.<br><br>On the evening of October 11 Seslávin came to the Aristóvo headquarters<br>with a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner said that the<br>troops that had entered Formínsk that day were the vanguard of the whole<br>army, that Napoleon was there and the whole army had left Moscow four<br>days previously. That same evening a house serf who had come from<br>Bórovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town. Some<br>Cossacks of Dokhtúrov’s detachment reported having sighted the French<br>Guards marching along the road to Bórovsk. From all these reports it was<br>evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there<br>was now the whole French army marching from Moscow in an unexpected<br>direction—along the Kalúga road. Dokhtúrov was unwilling to undertake<br>any action, as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do. He had<br>been ordered to attack Formínsk. But only Broussier had been there at<br>that time and now the whole French army was there. Ermólov wished to act<br>on his own judgment, but Dokhtúrov insisted that he must have Kutúzov’s<br>instructions. So it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff.<br><br>For this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhovítinov, was chosen, who<br>was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides delivering<br>a written report. Toward midnight Bolkhovítinov, having received the<br>dispatch and verbal instructions, galloped off to the General Staff<br>accompanied by a Cossack with spare horses.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>It was a warm, dark, autumn night. It had been raining for four days.<br>Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a<br>half over a sticky, muddy road, Bolkhovítinov reached Litashëvka after<br>one o’clock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence<br>hung a signboard, GENERAL STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he entered<br>a dark passage.<br><br>“The general on duty, quick! It’s very important!” said he to someone<br>who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage.<br><br>“He has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night<br>he has not slept,” said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper. “You should<br>wake the captain first.”<br><br>“But this is very important, from General Dokhtúrov,” said<br>Bolkhovítinov, entering the open door which he had found by feeling in<br>the dark.<br><br>The orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody.<br><br>“Your honor, your honor! A courier.”<br><br>“What? What’s that? From whom?” came a sleepy voice.<br><br>“From Dokhtúrov and from Alexéy Petróvich. Napoleon is at Formínsk,”<br>said Bolkhovítinov, unable to see in the dark who was speaking but<br>guessing by the voice that it was not Konovnítsyn.<br><br>The man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.<br><br>“I don’t like waking him,” he said, fumbling for something. “He is very<br>ill. Perhaps this is only a rumor.”<br><br>“Here is the dispatch,” said Bolkhovítinov. “My orders are to give it at<br>once to the general on duty.”<br><br>“Wait a moment, I’ll light a candle. You damned rascal, where do you<br>always hide it?” said the voice of the man who was stretching himself,<br>to the orderly. (This was Shcherbínin, Konovnítsyn’s adjutant.) “I’ve<br>found it, I’ve found it!” he added.<br><br>The orderly was striking a light and Shcherbínin was fumbling for<br>something on the candlestick.<br><br>“Oh, the nasty beasts!” said he with disgust.<br><br>By the light of the sparks Bolkhovítinov saw Shcherbínin’s youthful face<br>as he held the candle, and the face of another man who was still asleep.<br>This was Konovnítsyn.<br><br>When the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned<br>up, first blue and then red, Shcherbínin lit the tallow candle, from<br>the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were<br>running away, and looked at the messenger. Bolkhovítinov was bespattered<br>all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve.<br><br>“Who gave the report?” inquired Shcherbínin, taking the envelope.<br><br>“The news is reliable,” said Bolkhovítinov. “Prisoners, Cossacks, and<br>the scouts all say the same thing.”<br><br>“There’s nothing to be done, we’ll have to wake him,” said Shcherbínin,<br>rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a<br>greatcoat. “Peter Petróvich!” said he. (Konovnítsyn did not stir.) “To<br>the General Staff!” he said with a smile, knowing that those words would<br>be sure to arouse him.<br><br>And in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once. On<br>Konovnítsyn’s handsome, resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever,<br>there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote<br>from present affairs, but then he suddenly started and his face assumed<br>its habitual calm and firm appearance.<br><br>“Well, what is it? From whom?” he asked immediately but without hurry,<br>blinking at the light.<br><br>While listening to the officer’s report Konovnítsyn broke the seal and<br>read the dispatch. Hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in<br>their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his<br>boots. Then he took off his nightcap, combed his hair over his temples,<br>and donned his cap.<br><br>“Did you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness.”<br><br>Konovnítsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great<br>importance and that no time must be lost. He did not consider or ask<br>himself whether the news was good or bad. That did not interest him. He<br>regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his<br>reason but by something else. There was within him a deep unexpressed<br>conviction that all would be well, but that one must not trust to this<br>and still less speak about it, but must only attend to one’s own work.<br>And he did his work, giving his whole strength to the task.<br><br>Peter Petróvich Konovnítsyn, like Dokhtúrov, seems to have been included<br>merely for propriety’s sake in the list of the so-called heroes of<br>1812—the Barclays, Raévskis, Ermólovs, Plátovs, and Milorádoviches. Like<br>Dokhtúrov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity<br>and information, and like Dokhtúrov he never made plans of battle but<br>was always found where the situation was most difficult. Since his<br>appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open,<br>giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up. In<br>battle he was always under fire, so that Kutúzov reproved him for it and<br>feared to send him to the front, and like Dokhtúrov he was one of those<br>unnoticed cogwheels that, without clatter or noise, constitute the most<br>essential part of the machine.<br><br>Coming out of the hut into the damp, dark night Konovnítsyn<br>frowned—partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the<br>unpleasant thought that occurred to him, of how all that nest of<br>influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news,<br>especially Bennigsen, who ever since Tarútino had been at daggers<br>drawn with Kutúzov; and how they would make suggestions, quarrel, issue<br>orders, and rescind them. And this premonition was disagreeable to him<br>though he knew it could not be helped.<br><br>And in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the news, immediately<br>began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters, until<br>Konovnítsyn, who listened in weary silence, reminded him that they must<br>go to see his Highness.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVII<br><br>Kutúzov like all old people did not sleep much at night. He often fell<br>asleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his bed<br>without undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.<br><br>So he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred head on<br>his plump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and peering into the<br>darkness.<br><br>Since Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had more<br>influence than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid him, Kutúzov<br>was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being<br>obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements. The lesson of the<br>Tarútino battle and of the day before it, which Kutúzov remembered with<br>pain, must, he thought, have some effect on others too.<br><br>“They must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive.<br>Patience and time are my warriors, my champions,” thought Kutúzov. He<br>knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green. It will fall<br>of itself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled, the tree<br>is harmed, and your teeth are set on edge. Like an experienced sportsman<br>he knew that the beast was wounded, and wounded as only the whole<br>strength of Russia could have wounded it, but whether it was mortally<br>wounded or not was still an undecided question. Now by the fact of<br>Lauriston and Barthélemi having been sent, and by the reports of the<br>guerrillas, Kutúzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal. But he<br>needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait.<br><br>“They want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait and we shall<br>see! Continual maneuvers, continual advances!” thought he. “What for?<br>Only to distinguish themselves! As if fighting were fun. They are<br>like children from whom one can’t get any sensible account of what has<br>happened because they all want to show how well they can fight. But<br>that’s not what is needed now.<br><br>“And what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me! It seems to<br>them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies” (he<br>remembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg) “they have<br>foreseen everything. But the contingencies are endless.”<br><br>The undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at Borodinó was<br>mortal or not had hung over Kutúzov’s head for a whole month. On the one<br>hand the French had occupied Moscow. On the other Kutúzov felt assured<br>with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the<br>Russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal. But in any<br>case proofs were needed; he had waited a whole month for them and grew<br>more impatient the longer he waited. Lying on his bed during those<br>sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals<br>for doing. He imagined all sorts of possible contingencies, just like<br>the younger men, but with this difference, that he saw thousands of<br>contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them. The<br>longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves. He<br>imagined all sorts of movements of the Napoleonic army as a whole or<br>in sections—against Petersburg, or against him, or to outflank him.<br>He thought too of the possibility (which he feared most of all) that<br>Napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in Moscow<br>awaiting him. Kutúzov even imagined that Napoleon’s army might turn back<br>through Medýn and Yukhnóv, but the one thing he could not foresee was<br>what happened—the insane, convulsive stampede of Napoleon’s army during<br>its first eleven days after leaving Moscow: a stampede which made<br>possible what Kutúzov had not yet even dared to think of—the complete<br>extermination of the French. Dórokhov’s report about Broussier’s<br>division, the guerrillas’ reports of distress in Napoleon’s army, rumors<br>of preparations for leaving Moscow, all confirmed the supposition that<br>the French army was beaten and preparing for flight. But these were<br>only suppositions, which seemed important to the younger men but not to<br>Kutúzov. With his sixty years’ experience he knew what value to attach<br>to rumors, knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news<br>so that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he knew how readily<br>in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary. And the more<br>he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it. This question<br>absorbed all his mental powers. All else was to him only life’s<br>customary routine. To such customary routine belonged his conversations<br>with the staff, the letters he wrote from Tarútino to Madame de Staël,<br>the reading of novels, the distribution of awards, his correspondence<br>with Petersburg, and so on. But the destruction of the French, which he<br>alone foresaw, was his heart’s one desire.<br><br>On the night of the eleventh of October he lay leaning on his arm and<br>thinking of that.<br><br>There was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of Toll,<br>Konovnítsyn, and Bolkhovítinov.<br><br>“Eh, who’s there? Come in, come in! What news?” the field marshal called<br>out to them.<br><br>While a footman was lighting a candle, Toll communicated the substance<br>of the news.<br><br>“Who brought it?” asked Kutúzov with a look which, when the candle was<br>lit, struck Toll by its cold severity.<br><br>“There can be no doubt about it, your Highness.”<br><br>“Call him in, call him here.”<br><br>Kutúzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch<br>resting against the other which was doubled under him. He screwed up his<br>seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully, as if wishing to<br>read in his face what preoccupied his own mind.<br><br>“Tell me, tell me, friend,” said he to Bolkhovítinov in his low, aged<br>voice, as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest,<br>“come nearer—nearer. What news have you brought me? Eh? That Napoleon<br>has left Moscow? Are you sure? Eh?”<br><br>Bolkhovítinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had<br>been told to report.<br><br>“Speak quicker, quicker! Don’t torture me!” Kutúzov interrupted him.<br><br>Bolkhovítinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting<br>instructions. Toll was beginning to say something but Kutúzov checked<br>him. He tried to say something, but his face suddenly puckered and<br>wrinkled; he waved his arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side of<br>the room, to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there.<br><br>“O Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our prayer...” said he in a<br>tremulous voice with folded hands. “Russia is saved. I thank Thee, O<br>Lord!” and he wept.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>From the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all<br>Kutúzov’s activity was directed toward restraining his troops, by<br>authority, by guile, and by entreaty, from useless attacks,<br>maneuvers, or encounters with the perishing enemy. Dokhtúrov went to<br>Málo-Yaroslávets, but Kutúzov lingered with the main army and gave<br>orders for the evacuation of Kalúga—a retreat beyond which town seemed<br>to him quite possible.<br><br>Everywhere Kutúzov retreated, but the enemy without waiting for his<br>retreat fled in the opposite direction.<br><br>Napoleon’s historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at Tarútino<br>and Málo-Yaroslávets, and make conjectures as to what would have<br>happened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern<br>provinces.<br><br>But not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing<br>into those southern provinces (for the Russian army did not bar his<br>way), the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army, for<br>then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin. How<br>could that army—which had found abundant supplies in Moscow and had<br>trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them, and on arriving at<br>Smolénsk had looted provisions instead of storing them—how could that<br>army recuperate in Kalúga province, which was inhabited by Russians such<br>as those who lived in Moscow, and where fire had the same property of<br>consuming what was set ablaze?<br><br>That army could not recover anywhere. Since the battle of Borodinó<br>and the pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself, as it were, the<br>chemical elements of dissolution.<br><br>The members of what had once been an army—Napoleon himself and all his<br>soldiers fled—without knowing whither, each concerned only to make his<br>escape as quickly as possible from this position, of the hopelessness of<br>which they were all more or less vaguely conscious.<br><br>So it came about that at the council at Málo-Yaroslávets, when the<br>generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions, all<br>mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple-minded soldier<br>Mouton who, speaking last, said what they all felt: that the one thing<br>needful was to get away as quickly as possible; and no one, not<br>even Napoleon, could say anything against that truth which they all<br>recognized.<br><br>But though they all realized that it was necessary to get away, there<br>still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee. An<br>external shock was needed to overcome that shame, and this shock came in<br>due time. It was what the French called “le hourra de l’Empereur.”<br><br>The day after the council at Málo-Yaroslávets Napoleon rode out early in<br>the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and<br>an escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the<br>previous and of the impending battle. Some Cossacks on the prowl for<br>booty fell in with the Emperor and very nearly captured him. If the<br>Cossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what saved him was the very<br>thing that was destroying the French army, the booty on which the<br>Cossacks fell. Here as at Tarútino they went after plunder, leaving the<br>men. Disregarding Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and Napoleon<br>managed to escape.<br><br>When les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor himself<br>in the midst of his army, it was clear that there was nothing for it but<br>to fly as fast as possible along the nearest, familiar road. Napoleon<br>with his forty-year-old stomach understood that hint, not feeling his<br>former agility and boldness, and under the influence of the fright<br>the Cossacks had given him he at once agreed with Mouton and issued<br>orders—as the historians tell us—to retreat by the Smolénsk road.<br><br>That Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and that the army retreated, does<br>not prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the forces which<br>influenced the whole army and directed it along the Mozháysk (that is,<br>the Smolénsk) road acted simultaneously on him also.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIX<br><br>A man in motion always devises an aim for that motion. To be able to go<br>a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the<br>end of those thousand miles. One must have the prospect of a promised<br>land to have the strength to move.<br><br>The promised land for the French during their advance had been Moscow,<br>during their retreat it was their native land. But that native land<br>was too far off, and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely<br>necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself: “Today I<br>shall get to a place twenty-five miles off where I shall rest and<br>spend the night,” and during the first day’s journey that resting place<br>eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires. And<br>the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd.<br><br>For the French retreating along the old Smolénsk road, the final<br>goal—their native land—was too remote, and their immediate goal<br>was Smolénsk, toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously<br>intensified in the mass, urged them on. It was not that they knew that<br>much food and fresh troops awaited them in Smolénsk, nor that they were<br>told so (on the contrary their superior officers, and Napoleon himself,<br>knew that provisions were scarce there), but because this alone could<br>give them strength to move on and endure their present privations. So<br>both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves, and<br>pushed on to Smolénsk as to a promised land.<br><br>Coming out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising energy<br>and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on. Besides the<br>common impulse which bound the whole crowd of French into one mass and<br>supplied them with a certain energy, there was another cause binding<br>them together—their great numbers. As with the physical law of gravity,<br>their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself. In their<br>hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation.<br><br>Each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner<br>to escape from all this horror and misery; but on the one hand the force<br>of this common attraction to Smolénsk, their goal, drew each of them in<br>the same direction; on the other hand an army corps could not surrender<br>to a company, and though the French availed themselves of every<br>convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the<br>slightest decent pretext, such pretexts did not always occur. Their<br>very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that<br>possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the<br>Russians to stop this movement, to which the French were directing all<br>their energies. Beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the<br>body could hasten the process of decomposition.<br><br>A lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously. There is a certain<br>limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow. On<br>the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow<br>becomes.<br><br>Of the Russian commanders Kutúzov alone understood this. When the flight<br>of the French army along the Smolénsk road became well defined, what<br>Konovnítsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of October began<br>to occur. The superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves,<br>to cut off, to seize, to capture, and to overthrow the French, and all<br>clamored for action.<br><br>Kutúzov alone used all his power (and such power is very limited in the<br>case of any commander in chief) to prevent an attack.<br><br>He could not tell them what we say now: “Why fight, why block the road,<br>losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches? What<br>is the use of that, when a third of their army has melted away on the<br>road from Moscow to Vyázma without any battle?” But drawing from his<br>aged wisdom what they could understand, he told them of the golden<br>bridge, and they laughed at and slandered him, flinging themselves on,<br>rending and exulting over the dying beast.<br><br>Ermólov, Milorádovich, Plátov, and others in proximity to the French<br>near Vyázma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two<br>French corps, and by way of reporting their intention to Kutúzov they<br>sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope.<br><br>And try as Kutúzov might to restrain the troops, our men attacked,<br>trying to bar the road. Infantry regiments, we are told, advanced to the<br>attack with music and with drums beating, and killed and lost thousands<br>of men.<br><br>But they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the French army,<br>closing up more firmly at the danger, continued, while steadily melting<br>away, to pursue its fatal path to Smolénsk.<br><br><br><br><br><br>BOOK FOURTEEN: 1812<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>The Battle of Borodinó, with the occupation of Moscow that followed it<br>and the flight of the French without further conflicts, is one of the<br>most instructive phenomena in history.<br><br>All historians agree that the external activity of states and nations<br>in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars, and that as a<br>direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength<br>of states and nations increases or decreases.<br><br>Strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor,<br>having quarreled with another, collects an army, fights his enemy’s<br>army, gains a victory by killing three, five, or ten thousand men, and<br>subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions, all<br>the facts of history (as far as we know it) confirm the truth of the<br>statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another<br>is the cause, or at least an essential indication, of an increase or<br>decrease in the strength of the nation—even though it is unintelligible<br>why the defeat of an army—a hundredth part of a nation—should oblige<br>that whole nation to submit. An army gains a victory, and at once the<br>rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the<br>defeated. An army has suffered defeat, and at once a people loses its<br>rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if its army<br>suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated.<br><br>So according to history it has been found from the most ancient times,<br>and so it is to our own day. All Napoleon’s wars serve to confirm this<br>rule. In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army Austria loses<br>its rights, and the rights and the strength of France increase. The<br>victories of the French at Jena and Auerstädt destroy the independent<br>existence of Prussia.<br><br>But then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. Moscow is<br>taken and after that, with no further battles, it is not Russia that<br>ceases to exist, but the French army of six hundred thousand, and<br>then Napoleonic France itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules of<br>history: to say that the field of battle at Borodinó remained in the<br>hands of the Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles<br>that destroyed Napoleon’s army, is impossible.<br><br>After the French victory at Borodinó there was no general engagement nor<br>any that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist. What<br>does this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of China,<br>we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the<br>historians’ usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards);<br>if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number<br>of troops took part, we might treat it as an exception; but this event<br>occurred before our fathers’ eyes, and for them it was a question of the<br>life or death of their fatherland, and it happened in the greatest of<br>all known wars.<br><br>The period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodinó to the<br>expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not<br>produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest;<br>it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in<br>the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else.<br><br>The French historians, describing the condition of the French army<br>before it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army,<br>except the cavalry, the artillery, and the transport—there was no forage<br>for the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one could remedy,<br>for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the<br>French have it.<br><br>The victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants<br>Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their<br>carts to pillage the town, and in general personally failed to manifest<br>any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable multitude of such<br>peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for the high price offered<br>them, but burned it instead.<br><br>Let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers<br>according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has<br>gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants, feeling himself<br>wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his<br>life, throws down his rapier, and seizing the first cudgel that comes to<br>hand begins to brandish it. Then let us imagine that the combatant who<br>so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was<br>at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and, desiring to<br>conceal the facts of the case, insisted that he had gained his victory<br>with the rapier according to all the rules of art. One can imagine what<br>confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel.<br><br>The fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was<br>the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up<br>the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter<br>according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described<br>the event.<br><br>After the burning of Smolénsk a war began which did not follow any<br>previous traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the<br>retreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodinó and the renewed<br>retreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of<br>transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules.<br><br>Napoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing<br>attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent’s rapier saw a cudgel<br>raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to Kutúzov and to<br>the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all<br>the rules—as if there were any rules for killing people. In spite of the<br>complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules, in<br>spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it seemed rather<br>disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en<br>quarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and to make an adroit<br>thrust en prime, and so on—the cudgel of the people’s war was lifted<br>with all its menacing and majestic strength, and without consulting<br>anyone’s tastes or rules and regardless of anything else, it rose and<br>fell with stupid simplicity, but consistently, and belabored the French<br>till the whole invasion had perished.<br><br>And it is well for a people who do not—as the French did in 1813—salute<br>according to all the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt of their<br>rapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their magnanimous conqueror,<br>but at the moment of trial, without asking what rules others have<br>adopted in similar cases, simply and easily pick up the first cudgel<br>that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and<br>revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>One of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so-called<br>laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed<br>together in a mass. Such action always occurs in wars that take on a<br>national character. In such actions, instead of two crowds opposing<br>each other, the men disperse, attack singly, run away when attacked by<br>stronger forces, but again attack when opportunity offers. This was done<br>by the guerrillas in Spain, by the mountain tribes in the Caucasus, and<br>by the Russians in 1812.<br><br>People have called this kind of war “guerrilla warfare” and assume that<br>by so calling it they have explained its meaning. But such a war does<br>not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well-known rule<br>of tactics which is accepted as infallible. That rule says that an<br>attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his<br>opponent at the moment of conflict.<br><br>Guerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly infringes<br>that rule.<br><br>This contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes<br>the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers. Military<br>science says that the more troops the greater the strength. Les gros<br>bataillons ont toujours raison. *<br><br>    * Large battalions are always victorious.<br><br>For military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics<br>by reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are equal or unequal<br>to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal.<br><br>Momentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity.<br><br>In military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass<br>and some unknown x.<br><br>Military science, seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact<br>that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that<br>small detachments defeat larger ones, obscurely admits the existence<br>of this unknown factor and tries to discover it—now in a geometric<br>formation, now in the equipment employed, now, and most usually, in the<br>genius of the commanders. But the assignment of these various meanings<br>to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic<br>facts.<br><br>Yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted to gratify<br>the “heroes”) of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by<br>commanders, in order to find this unknown quantity.<br><br>That unknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to say, the<br>greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men<br>composing an army, quite independently of whether they are, or are not,<br>fighting under the command of a genius, in two—or three-line formation,<br>with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute. Men<br>who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous<br>conditions for fighting.<br><br>The spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives<br>the resulting force. To define and express the significance of this<br>unknown factor—the spirit of an army—is a problem for science.<br><br>This problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute<br>for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes<br>apparent—such as the commands of the general, the equipment employed,<br>and so on—mistaking these for the real significance of the factor,<br>and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being<br>the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger. Only then,<br>expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative<br>significance of this factor, can we hope to define the unknown.<br><br>Ten men, battalions, or divisions, fighting fifteen men, battalions, or<br>divisions, conquer—that is, kill or take captive—all the others, while<br>themselves losing four, so that on the one side four and on the other<br>fifteen were lost. Consequently the four were equal to the fifteen, and<br>therefore 4x = 15y. Consequently x/y = 15/4. This equation does not<br>give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two<br>unknowns. And by bringing variously selected historic units (battles,<br>campaigns, periods of war) into such equations, a series of numbers<br>could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be<br>discovered.<br><br>The tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking, and<br>in smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth that the<br>strength of an army depends on its spirit. To lead men forward under<br>fire more discipline (obtainable only by movement in masses) is needed<br>than is needed to resist attacks. But this rule which leaves out of<br>account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in<br>particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or<br>fall in the spirit of the troops occurs, as in all national wars.<br><br>The French, retreating in 1812—though according to tactics they should<br>have separated into detachments to defend themselves—congregated into<br>a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass<br>held the army together. The Russians, on the contrary, ought according<br>to tactics to have attacked in mass, but in fact they split up<br>into small units, because their spirit had so risen that separate<br>individuals, without orders, dealt blows at the French without needing<br>any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and<br>dangers.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>The so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into<br>Smolénsk.<br><br>Before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the<br>government, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had<br>been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, who killed them off<br>as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death. Denís Davýdov,<br>with his Russian instinct, was the first to recognize the value of<br>this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science<br>destroyed the French, and to him belongs the credit for taking the first<br>step toward regularizing this method of warfare.<br><br>On August 24 Davýdov’s first partisan detachment was formed and then<br>others were recognized. The further the campaign progressed the more<br>numerous these detachments became.<br><br>The irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered the<br>fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree—the<br>French army—and sometimes shook that tree itself. By October, when<br>the French were fleeing toward Smolénsk, there were hundreds of such<br>companies, of various sizes and characters. There were some that adopted<br>all the army methods and had infantry, artillery, staffs, and the<br>comforts of life. Others consisted solely of Cossack cavalry. There were<br>also small scratch groups of foot and horse, and groups of peasants and<br>landowners that remained unknown. A sacristan commanded one party which<br>captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month; and there<br>was Vasílisa, the wife of a village elder, who slew hundreds of the<br>French.<br><br>The partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of<br>October. Its first period had passed: when the partisans themselves,<br>amazed at their own boldness, feared every minute to be surrounded<br>and captured by the French, and hid in the forests without unsaddling,<br>hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued. By the end<br>of October this kind of warfare had taken definite shape: it had become<br>clear to all what could be ventured against the French and what could<br>not. Now only the commanders of detachments with staffs, and moving<br>according to rules at a distance from the French, still regarded many<br>things as impossible. The small bands that had started their activities<br>long before and had already observed the French closely considered<br>things possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare<br>to contemplate. The Cossacks and peasants who crept in among the French<br>now considered everything possible.<br><br>On October 22, Denísov (who was one of the irregulars) was with his<br>group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early morning he<br>and his party had been on the move. All day long he had been watching<br>from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of<br>cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the<br>army, which—as was learned from spies and prisoners—was moving under a<br>strong escort to Smolénsk. Besides Denísov and Dólokhov (who also led<br>a small party and moved in Denísov’s vicinity), the commanders of some<br>large divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and, as Denísov<br>expressed it, were sharpening their teeth for it. Two of the commanders<br>of large parties—one a Pole and the other a German—sent invitations<br>to Denísov almost simultaneously, requesting him to join up with their<br>divisions to attack the convoy.<br><br>“No, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself,” said Denísov on reading<br>these documents, and he wrote to the German that, despite his heartfelt<br>desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general, he had to forgo<br>that pleasure because he was already under the command of the Polish<br>general. To the Polish general he replied to the same effect, informing<br>him that he was already under the command of the German.<br><br>Having arranged matters thus, Denísov and Dólokhov intended, without<br>reporting matters to the higher command, to attack and seize that<br>convoy with their own small forces. On October 22 it was moving from<br>the village of Mikúlino to that of Shámshevo. To the left of the road<br>between Mikúlino and Shámshevo there were large forests, extending in<br>some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back<br>from it. Through these forests Denísov and his party rode all day,<br>sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very<br>edge, but never losing sight of the moving French. That morning,<br>Cossacks of Denísov’s party had seized and carried off into the forest<br>two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles, which had stuck in the mud not<br>far from Mikúlino where the forest ran close to the road. Since then,<br>and until evening, the party had watched the movements of the French<br>without attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach Shámshevo<br>quietly without alarming them and then, after joining Dólokhov who was<br>to come that evening to a consultation at a watchman’s hut in the forest<br>less than a mile from Shámshevo, to surprise the French at dawn, falling<br>like an avalanche on their heads from two sides, and rout and capture<br>them all at one blow.<br><br>In their rear, more than a mile from Mikúlino where the forest came<br>right up to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any fresh<br>columns of French should show themselves.<br><br>Beyond Shámshevo, Dólokhov was to observe the road in the same way, to<br>find out at what distance there were other French troops. They reckoned<br>that the convoy had fifteen hundred men. Denísov had two hundred, and<br>Dólokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of numbers did not<br>deter Denísov. All that he now wanted to know was what troops these were<br>and to learn that he had to capture a “tongue”—that is, a man from<br>the enemy column. That morning’s attack on the wagons had been made so<br>hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed; only a<br>little drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he was a straggler he<br>could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column.<br><br>Denísov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of<br>putting the whole column on the alert, so he sent Tíkhon Shcherbáty, a<br>peasant of his party, to Shámshevo to try and seize at least one of the<br>French quartermasters who had been sent on in advance.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>It was a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and the horizon were both<br>the color of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, and then<br>suddenly heavy slanting rain came down.<br><br>Denísov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down<br>was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides. Like his horse,<br>which turned its head and laid its ears back, he shrank from the driving<br>rain and gazed anxiously before him. His thin face with its short, thick<br>black beard looked angry.<br><br>Beside Denísov rode an esaul, * Denísov’s fellow worker, also in felt<br>cloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse.<br><br>    * A captain of Cossacks.<br><br>Esaul Lováyski the Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow,<br>pale-faced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with calm<br>self-satisfaction in his face and bearing. Though it was impossible to<br>say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay, yet at first<br>glance at the esaul and Denísov one saw that the latter was wet and<br>uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse, while looking at the<br>esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always<br>and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse, but a man who was one<br>with his horse, a being consequently possessed of twofold strength.<br><br>A little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and<br>wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap.<br><br>A little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirghíz mount with an enormous<br>tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a blue<br>French overcoat.<br><br>Beside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform and<br>blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held on to the<br>hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed about him<br>with surprise. This was the French drummer boy captured that morning.<br><br>Behind them along the narrow, sodden, cutup forest road came hussars in<br>threes and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some in French<br>greatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their heads. The horses,<br>being drenched by the rain, all looked black whether chestnut or bay.<br>Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes, looked strangely<br>thin. Steam rose from them. Clothes, saddles, reins, were all wet,<br>slippery, and sodden, like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed<br>the road. The men sat huddled up trying not to stir, so as to warm the<br>water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold<br>water that was leaking in under their seats, their knees, and at the<br>back of their necks. In the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two<br>wagons, drawn by French horses and by saddled Cossack horses that had<br>been hitched on in front, rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and<br>splashed through the water that lay in the ruts.<br><br>Denísov’s horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped<br>his rider’s knee against a tree.<br><br>“Oh, the devil!” exclaimed Denísov angrily, and showing his teeth he<br>struck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and his<br>comrades with mud.<br><br>Denísov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger<br>(none of them had eaten anything since morning), and yet more because he<br>still had no news from Dólokhov and the man sent to capture a “tongue”<br>had not returned.<br><br>“There’ll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today.<br>It’s too risky to attack them by oneself, and if we put it off till<br>another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey<br>from under our noses,” thought Denísov, continually peering forward,<br>hoping to see a messenger from Dólokhov.<br><br>On coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the<br>right, Denísov stopped.<br><br>“There’s someone coming,” said he.<br><br>The esaul looked in the direction Denísov indicated.<br><br>“There are two, an officer and a Cossack. But it is not presupposable<br>that it is the lieutenant colonel himself,” said the esaul, who was fond<br>of using words the Cossacks did not know.<br><br>The approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer<br>visible, but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a weary<br>gallop and using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and<br>drenched, whose trousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him,<br>standing in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer, a very young<br>lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped up to Denísov<br>and handed him a sodden envelope.<br><br>“From the general,” said the officer. “Please excuse its not being quite<br>dry.”<br><br>Denísov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.<br><br>“There, they kept telling us: ‘It’s dangerous, it’s dangerous,’”<br>said the officer, addressing the esaul while Denísov was reading the<br>dispatch. “But Komaróv and I”—he pointed to the Cossack—“were prepared.<br>We have each of us two pistols.... But what’s this?” he asked, noticing<br>the French drummer boy. “A prisoner? You’ve already been in action? May<br>I speak to him?”<br><br>“Wostóv! Pétya!” exclaimed Denísov, having run through the dispatch.<br>“Why didn’t you say who you were?” and turning with a smile he held out<br>his hand to the lad.<br><br>The officer was Pétya Rostóv.<br><br>All the way Pétya had been preparing himself to behave with Denísov as<br>befitted a grown-up man and an officer—without hinting at their previous<br>acquaintance. But as soon as Denísov smiled at him Pétya brightened<br>up, blushed with pleasure, forgot the official manner he had been<br>rehearsing, and began telling him how he had already been in a battle<br>near Vyázma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there.<br><br>“Well, I am glad to see you,” Denísov interrupted him, and his face<br>again assumed its anxious expression.<br><br>“Michael Feoklítych,” said he to the esaul, “this is again fwom that<br>German, you know. He”—he indicated Pétya—“is serving under him.”<br><br>And Denísov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a<br>repetition of the German general’s demand that he should join forces<br>with him for an attack on the transport.<br><br>“If we don’t take it tomowwow, he’ll snatch it fwom under our noses,” he<br>added.<br><br>While Denísov was talking to the esaul, Pétya—abashed by Denísov’s<br>cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his<br>trousers—furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so<br>that no one should notice it, while maintaining as martial an air as<br>possible.<br><br>“Will there be any orders, your honor?” he asked Denísov, holding his<br>hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for<br>which he had prepared himself, “or shall I remain with your honor?”<br><br>“Orders?” Denísov repeated thoughtfully. “But can you stay till<br>tomowwow?”<br><br>“Oh, please... May I stay with you?” cried Pétya.<br><br>“But, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?” asked<br>Denísov.<br><br>Pétya blushed.<br><br>“He gave me no instructions. I think I could?” he returned, inquiringly.<br><br>“Well, all wight,” said Denísov.<br><br>And turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place<br>arranged near the watchman’s hut in the forest, and told the officer on<br>the Kirghíz horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant) to go and<br>find out where Dólokhov was and whether he would come that evening.<br>Denísov himself intended going with the esaul and Pétya to the edge of<br>the forest where it reached out to Shámshevo, to have a look at the part<br>of the French bivouac they were to attack next day.<br><br>“Well, old fellow,” said he to the peasant guide, “lead us to<br>Shámshevo.”<br><br>Denísov, Pétya, and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and the<br>hussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to the<br>edge of the forest.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>The rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from<br>the trees. Denísov, the esaul, and Pétya rode silently, following the<br>peasant in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned toes<br>and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves,<br>silently led them to the edge of the forest.<br><br>He ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced to where<br>the screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large oak tree that<br>had not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to<br>them with his hand.<br><br>Denísov and Pétya rode up to him. From the spot where the peasant was<br>standing they could see the French. Immediately beyond the forest, on a<br>downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To the right, beyond a steep<br>ravine, was a small village and a landowner’s house with a broken roof.<br>In the village, in the house, in the garden, by the well, by the pond,<br>over all the rising ground, and all along the road uphill from the<br>bridge leading to the village, not more than five hundred yards<br>away, crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist. Their<br>un-Russian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the<br>carts, and their calls to one another, could be clearly heard.<br><br>“Bwing the prisoner here,” said Denísov in a low voice, not taking his<br>eyes off the French.<br><br>A Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to Denísov.<br>Pointing to the French troops, Denísov asked him what these and those<br>of them were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and<br>lifting his eyebrows, looked at Denísov in affright, but in spite of<br>an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers, merely<br>assenting to everything Denísov asked him. Denísov turned away from him<br>frowning and addressed the esaul, conveying his own conjectures to him.<br><br>Pétya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy, now<br>at Denísov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in the village and<br>along the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.<br><br>“Whether Dólokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?” said Denísov with<br>a merry sparkle in his eyes.<br><br>“It is a very suitable spot,” said the esaul.<br><br>“We’ll send the infantwy down by the swamps,” Denísov continued.<br>“They’ll cweep up to the garden; you’ll wide up fwom there with the<br>Cossacks”—he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village—“and I<br>with my hussars fwom here. And at the signal shot...”<br><br>“The hollow is impassable—there’s a swamp there,” said the esaul. “The<br>horses would sink. We must ride round more to the left....”<br><br>While they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded<br>from the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, then<br>another, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French voices<br>shouting together came up from the slope. For a moment Denísov and the<br>esaul drew back. They were so near that they thought they were the cause<br>of the firing and shouting. But the firing and shouting did not relate<br>to them. Down below, a man wearing something red was running through the<br>marsh. The French were evidently firing and shouting at him.<br><br>“Why, that’s our Tíkhon,” said the esaul.<br><br>“So it is! It is!”<br><br>“The wascal!” said Denísov.<br><br>“He’ll get away!” said the esaul, screwing up his eyes.<br><br>The man whom they called Tíkhon, having run to the stream, plunged in<br>so that the water splashed in the air, and, having disappeared for an<br>instant, scrambled out on all fours, all black with the wet, and ran on.<br>The French who had been pursuing him stopped.<br><br>“Smart, that!” said the esaul.<br><br>“What a beast!” said Denísov with his former look of vexation. “What has<br>he been doing all this time?”<br><br>“Who is he?” asked Pétya.<br><br>“He’s our plastún. I sent him to capture a ‘tongue.’”<br><br>“Oh, yes,” said Pétya, nodding at the first words Denísov uttered as if<br>he understood it all, though he really did not understand anything of<br>it.<br><br>Tíkhon Shcherbáty was one of the most indispensable men in their band.<br>He was a peasant from Pokróvsk, near the river Gzhat. When Denísov had<br>come to Pokróvsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual<br>summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the French,<br>the elder, as though shielding himself, had replied, as all village<br>elders did, that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them. But<br>when Denísov explained that his purpose was to kill the French, and<br>asked if no French had strayed that way, the elder replied that some<br>“more-orderers” had really been at their village, but that Tíkhon<br>Shcherbáty was the only man who dealt with such matters. Denísov had<br>Tíkhon called and, having praised him for his activity, said a few words<br>in the elder’s presence about loyalty to the Tsar and the country and<br>the hatred of the French that all sons of the fatherland should cherish.<br><br>“We don’t do the French any harm,” said Tíkhon, evidently frightened by<br>Denísov’s words. “We only fooled about with the lads for fun, you know!<br>We killed a score or so of ‘more-orderers,’ but we did no harm else....”<br><br>Next day when Denísov had left Pokróvsk, having quite forgotten about<br>this peasant, it was reported to him that Tíkhon had attached himself<br>to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it. Denísov gave<br>orders to let him do so.<br><br>Tíkhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching water,<br>flaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking and aptitude<br>for partisan warfare. At night he would go out for booty and always<br>brought back French clothing and weapons, and when told to would bring<br>in French captives also. Denísov then relieved him from drudgery and<br>began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him<br>enrolled among the Cossacks.<br><br>Tíkhon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging<br>behind the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which he carried<br>rather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he used as a wolf uses<br>its teeth, with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching<br>thick bones. Tíkhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at<br>arm’s length, or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs<br>or carve spoons. In Denísov’s party he held a peculiar and exceptional<br>position. When anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be<br>done—to push a cart out of the mud with one’s shoulders, pull a horse<br>out of a swamp by its tail, skin it, slink in among the French, or walk<br>more than thirty miles in a day—everybody pointed laughingly at Tíkhon.<br><br>“It won’t hurt that devil—he’s as strong as a horse!” they said of him.<br><br>Once a Frenchman Tíkhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him<br>and shot him in the fleshy part of the back. That wound (which Tíkhon<br>treated only with internal and external applications of vodka) was the<br>subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment—jokes in which<br>Tíkhon readily joined.<br><br>“Hallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?” the Cossacks would banter<br>him. And Tíkhon, purposely writhing and making faces, pretended to be<br>angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only effect<br>of this incident on Tíkhon was that after being wounded he seldom<br>brought in prisoners.<br><br>He was the bravest and most useful man in the party. No one found more<br>opportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed more Frenchmen,<br>and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars<br>and willingly accepted that role. Now he had been sent by Denísov<br>overnight to Shámshevo to capture a “tongue.” But whether because he<br>had not been content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept<br>through the night, he had crept by day into some bushes right among the<br>French and, as Denísov had witnessed from above, had been detected by<br>them.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>After talking for some time with the esaul about next day’s attack,<br>which now, seeing how near they were to the French, he seemed to have<br>definitely decided on, Denísov turned his horse and rode back.<br><br>“Now, my lad, we’ll go and get dwy,” he said to Pétya.<br><br>As they approached the watchhouse Denísov stopped, peering into the<br>forest. Among the trees a man with long legs and long, swinging arms,<br>wearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a Kazán hat, was approaching<br>with long, light steps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax<br>stuck in his girdle. When he espied Denísov he hastily threw something<br>into the bushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim, and<br>approached his commander. It was Tíkhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked<br>face and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment. He<br>lifted his head high and gazed at Denísov as if repressing a laugh.<br><br>“Well, where did you disappear to?” inquired Denísov.<br><br>“Where did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen,” answered Tíkhon<br>boldly and hurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass voice.<br><br>“Why did you push yourself in there by daylight? You ass! Well, why<br>haven’t you taken one?”<br><br>“Oh, I took one all right,” said Tíkhon.<br><br>“Where is he?”<br><br>“You see, I took him first thing at dawn,” Tíkhon continued, spreading<br>out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes. “I took him<br>into the forest. Then I see he’s no good and think I’ll go and fetch a<br>likelier one.”<br><br>“You see?... What a wogue—it’s just as I thought,” said Denísov to the<br>esaul. “Why didn’t you bwing that one?”<br><br>“What was the good of bringing him?” Tíkhon interrupted hastily and<br>angrily—“that one wouldn’t have done for you. As if I don’t know what<br>sort you want!”<br><br>“What a bwute you are!... Well?”<br><br>“I went for another one,” Tíkhon continued, “and I crept like this<br>through the wood and lay down.” (He suddenly lay down on his stomach<br>with a supple movement to show how he had done it.) “One turned up and<br>I grabbed him, like this.” (He jumped up quickly and lightly.) “‘Come<br>along to the colonel,’ I said. He starts yelling, and suddenly there<br>were four of them. They rushed at me with their little swords. So I went<br>for them with my ax, this way: ‘What are you up to?’ says I. ‘Christ<br>be with you!’” shouted Tíkhon, waving his arms with an angry scowl and<br>throwing out his chest.<br><br>“Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the<br>puddles!” said the esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.<br><br>Pétya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained from<br>laughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from Tíkhon’s face to the esaul’s<br>and Denísov’s, unable to make out what it all meant.<br><br>“Don’t play the fool!” said Denísov, coughing angrily. “Why didn’t you<br>bwing the first one?”<br><br>Tíkhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other,<br>then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish grin,<br>disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth (that was why he was called<br>Shcherbáty—the gap-toothed). Denísov smiled, and Pétya burst into a peal<br>of merry laughter in which Tíkhon himself joined.<br><br>“Oh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing,” said Tíkhon. “The clothes<br>on him—poor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your honor! Why,<br>he says: ‘I’m a general’s son myself, I won’t go!’ he says.”<br><br>“You are a bwute!” said Denísov. “I wanted to question...”<br><br>“But I questioned him,” said Tíkhon. “He said he didn’t know much.<br>‘There are a lot of us,’ he says, ‘but all poor stuff—only soldiers in<br>name,’ he says. ‘Shout loud at them,’ he says, ‘and you’ll take<br>them all,’” Tíkhon concluded, looking cheerfully and resolutely into<br>Denísov’s eyes.<br><br>“I’ll give you a hundwed sharp lashes—that’ll teach you to play the<br>fool!” said Denísov severely.<br><br>“But why are you angry?” remonstrated Tíkhon, “just as if I’d never seen<br>your Frenchmen! Only wait till it gets dark and I’ll fetch you any of<br>them you want—three if you like.”<br><br>“Well, let’s go,” said Denísov, and rode all the way to the watchhouse<br>in silence and frowning angrily.<br><br>Tíkhon followed behind and Pétya heard the Cossacks laughing with him<br>and at him, about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes.<br><br>When the fit of laughter that had seized him at Tíkhon’s words and smile<br>had passed and Pétya realized for a moment that this Tíkhon had killed a<br>man, he felt uneasy. He looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt<br>a pang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted only a moment. He felt<br>it necessary to hold his head higher, to brace himself, and to question<br>the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrow’s undertaking, that<br>he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself.<br><br>The officer who had been sent to inquire met Denísov on the way with the<br>news that Dólokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him.<br><br>Denísov at once cheered up and, calling Pétya to him, said: “Well, tell<br>me about yourself.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>Pétya, having left his people after their departure from Moscow, joined<br>his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a<br>large guerrilla detachment. From the time he received his commission,<br>and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in<br>the battle of Vyázma, Pétya had been in a constant state of blissful<br>excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to<br>miss any chance to do something really heroic. He was highly delighted<br>with what he saw and experienced in the army, but at the same time<br>it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being<br>performed just where he did not happen to be. And he was always in a<br>hurry to get where he was not.<br><br>When on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish to send<br>somebody to Denísov’s detachment, Pétya begged so piteously to be sent<br>that the general could not refuse. But when dispatching him he recalled<br>Pétya’s mad action at the battle of Vyázma, where instead of riding by<br>the road to the place to which he had been sent, he had galloped to the<br>advanced line under the fire of the French and had there twice fired<br>his pistol. So now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any<br>action whatever of Denísov’s. That was why Pétya had blushed and grown<br>confused when Denísov asked him whether he could stay. Before they had<br>ridden to the outskirts of the forest Pétya had considered he must carry<br>out his instructions strictly and return at once. But when he saw the<br>French and saw Tíkhon and learned that there would certainly be an<br>attack that night, he decided, with the rapidity with which young people<br>change their views, that the general, whom he had greatly respected till<br>then, was a rubbishy German, that Denísov was a hero, the esaul a hero,<br>and Tíkhon a hero too, and that it would be shameful for him to leave<br>them at a moment of difficulty.<br><br>It was already growing dusk when Denísov, Pétya, and the esaul rode up<br>to the watchhouse. In the twilight saddled horses could be seen, and<br>Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and<br>were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the French<br>could not see the smoke. In the passage of the small watchhouse a<br>Cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton. In the room<br>three officers of Denísov’s band were converting a door into a tabletop.<br>Pétya took off his wet clothes, gave them to be dried, and at once began<br>helping the officers to fix up the dinner table.<br><br>In ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it. On the<br>table were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt.<br><br>Sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton<br>with his hands, down which the grease trickled, Pétya was in an ecstatic<br>childish state of love for all men, and consequently of confidence that<br>others loved him in the same way.<br><br>“So then what do you think, Vasíli Dmítrich?” said he to Denísov. “It’s<br>all right my staying a day with you?” And not waiting for a reply he<br>answered his own question: “You see I was told to find out—well, I am<br>finding out.... Only do let me into the very... into the chief... I<br>don’t want a reward.... But I want...”<br><br>Pétya clenched his teeth and looked around, throwing back his head and<br>flourishing his arms.<br><br>“Into the vewy chief...” Denísov repeated with a smile.<br><br>“Only, please let me command something, so that I may really command...”<br>Pétya went on. “What would it be to you?... Oh, you want a knife?” he<br>said, turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton.<br><br>And he handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.<br><br>“Please keep it. I have several like it,” said Pétya, blushing.<br>“Heavens! I was quite forgetting!” he suddenly cried. “I have some<br>raisins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones. We have a new sutler and<br>he has such capital things. I bought ten pounds. I am used to something<br>sweet. Would you like some?...” and Pétya ran out into the passage to<br>his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds<br>of raisins. “Have some, gentlemen, have some!”<br><br>“You want a coffeepot, don’t you?” he asked the esaul. “I bought a<br>capital one from our sutler! He has splendid things. And he’s very<br>honest, that’s the chief thing. I’ll be sure to send it to you. Or<br>perhaps your flints are giving out, or are worn out—that happens<br>sometimes, you know. I have brought some with me, here they are”—and he<br>showed a bag—“a hundred flints. I bought them very cheap. Please take as<br>many as you want, or all if you like....”<br><br>Then suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, Pétya stopped and<br>blushed.<br><br>He tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was<br>foolish. And running over the events of the day he remembered the French<br>drummer boy. “It’s capital for us here, but what of him? Where have they<br>put him? Have they fed him? Haven’t they hurt his feelings?” he thought.<br>But having caught himself saying too much about the flints, he was now<br>afraid to speak out.<br><br>“I might ask,” he thought, “but they’ll say: ‘He’s a boy himself and so<br>he pities the boy.’ I’ll show them tomorrow whether I’m a boy. Will it<br>seem odd if I ask?” Pétya thought. “Well, never mind!” and immediately,<br>blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared<br>ironical, he said:<br><br>“May I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to<br>eat?... Perhaps...”<br><br>“Yes, he’s a poor little fellow,” said Denísov, who evidently saw<br>nothing shameful in this reminder. “Call him in. His name is Vincent<br>Bosse. Have him fetched.”<br><br>“I’ll call him,” said Pétya.<br><br>“Yes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow,” Denísov repeated.<br><br>Pétya was standing at the door when Denísov said this. He slipped in<br>between the officers, came close to Denísov, and said:<br><br>“Let me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how fine, how splendid!”<br><br>And having kissed Denísov he ran out of the hut.<br><br>“Bosse! Vincent!” Pétya cried, stopping outside the door.<br><br>“Who do you want, sir?” asked a voice in the darkness.<br><br>Pétya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured that<br>day.<br><br>“Ah, Vesénny?” said a Cossack.<br><br>Vincent, the boy’s name, had already been changed by the Cossacks into<br>Vesénny (vernal) and into Vesénya by the peasants and soldiers. In both<br>these adaptations the reference to spring (vesná) matched the impression<br>made by the young lad.<br><br>“He is warming himself there by the bonfire. Ho, Vesénya!<br>Vesénya!—Vesénny!” laughing voices were heard calling to one another in<br>the darkness.<br><br>“He’s a smart lad,” said an hussar standing near Pétya. “We gave him<br>something to eat a while ago. He was awfully hungry!”<br><br>The sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the<br>darkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.<br><br>“Ah, c’est vous!” said Pétya. “Voulez-vous manger? N’ayez pas peur, on<br>ne vous fera pas de mal,” * he added shyly and affectionately, touching<br>the boy’s hand. “Entrez, entrez.” *(2)<br><br>     * “Ah, it’s you! Do you want something to eat? Don’t be<br>     afraid, they won’t hurt you.”<br><br>     * (2) “Come in, come in.”<br><br><br>“Merci, monsieur,” * said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish<br>voice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.<br><br>    * “Thank you, sir.”<br><br><br>There were many things Pétya wanted to say to the drummer boy, but did<br>not dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage. Then in<br>the darkness he took the boy’s hand and pressed it.<br><br>“Come in, come in!” he repeated in a gentle whisper. “Oh, what can I do<br>for him?” he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in first.<br><br>When the boy had entered the hut, Pétya sat down at a distance from<br>him, considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him. But<br>he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem<br>ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>The arrival of Dólokhov diverted Pétya’s attention from the drummer boy,<br>to whom Denísov had had some mutton and vodka given, and whom he had had<br>dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and<br>not sent away with the other prisoners. Pétya had heard in the army many<br>stories of Dólokhov’s extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the<br>French, so from the moment he entered the hut Pétya did not take his<br>eyes from him, but braced himself up more and more and held his head<br>high, that he might not be unworthy even of such company.<br><br>Dólokhov’s appearance amazed Pétya by its simplicity.<br><br>Denísov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, had an icon of Nicholas the<br>Wonder-Worker on his breast, and his way of speaking and everything he<br>did indicated his unusual position. But Dólokhov, who in Moscow had worn<br>a Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most correct officer of<br>the Guards. He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsman’s padded coat with<br>an Order of St. George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set<br>straight on his head. He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of<br>the room, and without greeting anyone went up to Denísov and began<br>questioning him about the matter in hand. Denísov told him of the<br>designs the large detachments had on the transport, of the message Pétya<br>had brought, and his own replies to both generals. Then he told him all<br>he knew of the French detachment.<br><br>“That’s so. But we must know what troops they are and their numbers,”<br>said Dólokhov. “It will be necessary to go there. We can’t start the<br>affair without knowing for certain how many there are. I like to work<br>accurately. Here now—wouldn’t one of these gentlemen like to ride over<br>to the French camp with me? I have brought a spare uniform.”<br><br>“I, I... I’ll go with you!” cried Pétya.<br><br>“There’s no need for you to go at all,” said Denísov, addressing<br>Dólokhov, “and as for him, I won’t let him go on any account.”<br><br>“I like that!” exclaimed Pétya. “Why shouldn’t I go?”<br><br>“Because it’s useless.”<br><br>“Well, you must excuse me, because... because... I shall go, and that’s<br>all. You’ll take me, won’t you?” he said, turning to Dólokhov.<br><br>“Why not?” Dólokhov answered absently, scrutinizing the face of the<br>French drummer boy. “Have you had that youngster with you long?” he<br>asked Denísov.<br><br>“He was taken today but he knows nothing. I’m keeping him with me.”<br><br>“Yes, and where do you put the others?” inquired Dólokhov.<br><br>“Where? I send them away and take a weceipt for them,” shouted Denísov,<br>suddenly flushing. “And I say boldly that I have not a single man’s life<br>on my conscience. Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or<br>thwee hundwed men to town under escort, instead of staining—I speak<br>bluntly—staining the honor of a soldier?”<br><br>“That kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of<br>sixteen,” said Dólokhov with cold irony, “but it’s time for you to drop<br>it.”<br><br>“Why, I’ve not said anything! I only say that I’ll certainly go with<br>you,” said Pétya shyly.<br><br>“But for you and me, old fellow, it’s time to drop these amenities,”<br>continued Dólokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of<br>this subject which irritated Denísov. “Now, why have you kept this lad?”<br>he went on, swaying his head. “Because you are sorry for him! Don’t we<br>know those ‘receipts’ of yours? You send a hundred men away, and thirty<br>get there. The rest either starve or get killed. So isn’t it all the<br>same not to send them?”<br><br>The esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.<br><br>“That’s not the point. I’m not going to discuss the matter. I do not<br>wish to take it on my conscience. You say they’ll die. All wight. Only<br>not by my fault!”<br><br>Dólokhov began laughing.<br><br>“Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over? But if<br>they did catch me they’d string me up to an aspen tree, and with all<br>your chivalry just the same.” He paused. “However, we must get to work.<br>Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French uniforms in it.<br>Well, are you coming with me?” he asked Pétya.<br><br>“I? Yes, yes, certainly!” cried Pétya, blushing almost to tears and<br>glancing at Denísov.<br><br>While Dólokhov had been disputing with Denísov what should be done with<br>prisoners, Pétya had once more felt awkward and restless; but again he<br>had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about. “If grown-up,<br>distinguished men think so, it must be necessary and right,” thought he.<br>“But above all Denísov must not dare to imagine that I’ll obey him and<br>that he can order me about. I will certainly go to the French camp with<br>Dólokhov. If he can, so can I!”<br><br>And to all Denísov’s persuasions, Pétya replied that he too was<br>accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow, and that he<br>never considered personal danger.<br><br>“For you’ll admit that if we don’t know for sure how many of them there<br>are... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are only two<br>of us. Besides, I want to go very much and certainly will go, so don’t<br>hinder me,” said he. “It will only make things worse....”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>Having put on French greatcoats and shakos, Pétya and Dólokhov rode to<br>the clearing from which Denísov had reconnoitered the French camp,<br>and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the<br>hollow. On reaching the bottom, Dólokhov told the Cossacks accompanying<br>him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the<br>bridge. Pétya, his heart in his mouth with excitement, rode by his side.<br><br>“If we’re caught, I won’t be taken alive! I have a pistol,” whispered<br>he.<br><br>“Don’t talk Russian,” said Dólokhov in a hurried whisper, and at that<br>very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge: “Qui vive?” *<br>and the click of a musket.<br><br>    * “Who goes there?”<br><br><br>The blood rushed to Pétya’s face and he grasped his pistol.<br><br>“Lanciers du 6-me,” * replied Dólokhov, neither hastening nor slackening<br>his horse’s pace.<br><br>    * “Lancers of the 6th Regiment.”<br><br><br>The black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.<br><br>“Mot d’ordre.” *<br><br>    * “Password.”<br><br><br>Dólokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.<br><br>“Dites donc, le colonel Gérard est ici?” * he asked.<br><br>    * “Tell me, is Colonel Gérard here?”<br><br><br>“Mot d’ordre,” repeated the sentinel, barring the way and not replying.<br><br>“Quand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne demandent pas le<br>mot d’ordre...” cried Dólokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight<br>at the sentinel. “Je vous demande si le colonel est ici.” *<br><br>     * “When an officer is making his round, sentinels don’t ask<br>     him for the password.... I am asking you if the colonel is<br>     here.”<br><br><br>And without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped<br>aside, Dólokhov rode up the incline at a walk.<br><br>Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, Dólokhov stopped<br>him and inquired where the commander and officers were. The man,<br>a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up to<br>Dólokhov’s horse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply and in<br>a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up<br>the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, as he called the<br>landowner’s house.<br><br>Having ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk could be<br>heard around the campfires, Dólokhov turned into the courtyard of the<br>landowner’s house. Having ridden in, he dismounted and approached a<br>big blazing campfire, around which sat several men talking noisily.<br>Something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and<br>a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by the fire, was<br>kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod.<br><br>“Oh, he’s a hard nut to crack,” said one of the officers who was sitting<br>in the shadow at the other side of the fire.<br><br>“He’ll make them get a move on, those fellows!” said another, laughing.<br><br>Both fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the sound of<br>Dólokhov’s and Pétya’s steps as they advanced to the fire leading their<br>horses.<br><br>“Bonjour, messieurs!” * said Dólokhov loudly and clearly.<br><br>    * “Good day, gentlemen.”<br><br><br>There was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire,<br>and one tall, long-necked officer, walking round the fire, came up to<br>Dólokhov.<br><br>“Is that you, Clément?” he asked. “Where the devil...?” But, noticing<br>his mistake, he broke off short and, with a frown, greeted Dólokhov as a<br>stranger, asking what he could do for him.<br><br>Dólokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their<br>regiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew<br>anything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything, and Pétya<br>thought the officers were beginning to look at him and Dólokhov with<br>hostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were silent.<br><br>“If you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too late,” said<br>a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh.<br><br>Dólokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that<br>night.<br><br>He handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and<br>squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long<br>neck. That officer did not take his eyes from Dólokhov and again asked<br>to what regiment he belonged. Dólokhov, as if he had not heard the<br>question, did not reply, but lighting a short French pipe which he took<br>from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them<br>was safe from Cossacks.<br><br>“Those brigands are everywhere,” replied an officer from behind the<br>fire.<br><br>Dólokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers<br>such as his companion and himself, “but probably they would not dare to<br>attack large detachments?” he added inquiringly. No one replied.<br><br>“Well, now he’ll come away,” Pétya thought every moment as he stood by<br>the campfire listening to the talk.<br><br>But Dólokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began<br>putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion,<br>how many battalions, and how many prisoners. Asking about the Russian<br>prisoners with that detachment, Dólokhov said:<br><br>“A horrid business dragging these corpses about with one! It would be<br>better to shoot such rabble,” and burst into loud laughter, so strange<br>that Pétya thought the French would immediately detect their disguise,<br>and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire.<br><br>No one replied a word to Dólokhov’s laughter, and a French officer whom<br>they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and whispered<br>something to a companion. Dólokhov got up and called to the soldier who<br>was holding their horses.<br><br>“Will they bring our horses or not?” thought Pétya, instinctively<br>drawing nearer to Dólokhov.<br><br>The horses were brought.<br><br>“Good evening, gentlemen,” said Dólokhov.<br><br>Pétya wished to say “Good night” but could not utter a word. The<br>officers were whispering together. Dólokhov was a long time mounting<br>his horse which would not stand still, then he rode out of the yard at a<br>footpace. Pétya rode beside him, longing to look round to see whether or<br>not the French were running after them, but not daring to.<br><br>Coming out onto the road Dólokhov did not ride back across the open<br>country, but through the village. At one spot he stopped and listened.<br>“Do you hear?” he asked. Pétya recognized the sound of Russian voices<br>and saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round their campfires.<br>When they had descended to the bridge Pétya and Dólokhov rode past the<br>sentinel, who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it, then<br>they descended into the hollow where the Cossacks awaited them.<br><br>“Well now, good-by. Tell Denísov, ‘at the first shot at daybreak,’” said<br>Dólokhov and was about to ride away, but Pétya seized hold of him.<br><br>“Really!” he cried, “you are such a hero! Oh, how fine, how splendid!<br>How I love you!”<br><br>“All right, all right!” said Dólokhov. But Pétya did not let go of him<br>and Dólokhov saw through the gloom that Pétya was bending toward him and<br>wanted to kiss him. Dólokhov kissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and<br>vanished into the darkness.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>Having returned to the watchman’s hut, Pétya found Denísov in the<br>passage. He was awaiting Pétya’s return in a state of agitation,<br>anxiety, and self-reproach for having let him go.<br><br>“Thank God!” he exclaimed. “Yes, thank God!” he repeated, listening to<br>Pétya’s rapturous account. “But, devil take you, I haven’t slept because<br>of you! Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can still get a nap before<br>morning.”<br><br>“But... no,” said Pétya, “I don’t want to sleep yet. Besides I know<br>myself, if I fall asleep it’s finished. And then I am used to not<br>sleeping before a battle.”<br><br>He sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his<br>expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day.<br><br>Then, noticing that Denísov was asleep, he rose and went out of doors.<br><br>It was still quite dark outside. The rain was over, but drops were still<br>falling from the trees. Near the watchman’s hut the black shapes of the<br>Cossacks’ shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen. Behind<br>the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them<br>were discernible, and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red.<br>Not all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep; here and there, amid the<br>sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by, could be<br>heard low voices which seemed to be whispering.<br><br>Pétya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the wagons.<br>Someone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses<br>munching their oats. In the dark Pétya recognized his own horse, which<br>he called “Karabákh” though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to it.<br><br>“Well, Karabákh! We’ll do some service tomorrow,” said he, sniffing its<br>nostrils and kissing it.<br><br>“Why aren’t you asleep, sir?” said a Cossack who was sitting under a<br>wagon.<br><br>“No, ah... Likhachëv—isn’t that your name? Do you know I have only just<br>come back! We’ve been into the French camp.”<br><br>And Pétya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but<br>also of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his life<br>than to act “just anyhow.”<br><br>“Well, you should get some sleep now,” said the Cossack.<br><br>“No, I am used to this,” said Pétya. “I say, aren’t the flints in your<br>pistols worn out? I brought some with me. Don’t you want any? You can<br>have some.”<br><br>The Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at<br>Pétya.<br><br>“Because I am accustomed to doing everything accurately,” said Pétya.<br>“Some fellows do things just anyhow, without preparation, and then<br>they’re sorry for it afterwards. I don’t like that.”<br><br>“Just so,” said the Cossack.<br><br>“Oh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen my<br>saber for me? It’s got bl...” (Pétya feared to tell a lie, and the saber<br>never had been sharpened.) “Can you do it?”<br><br>“Of course I can.”<br><br>Likhachëv got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon Pétya heard the warlike<br>sound of steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon and sat on its<br>edge. The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon.<br><br>“I say! Are the lads asleep?” asked Pétya.<br><br>“Some are, and some aren’t—like us.”<br><br>“Well, and that boy?”<br><br>“Vesénny? Oh, he’s thrown himself down there in the passage. Fast asleep<br>after his fright. He was that glad!”<br><br>After that Pétya remained silent for a long time, listening to the<br>sounds. He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared.<br><br>“What are you sharpening?” asked a man coming up to the wagon.<br><br>“Why, this gentleman’s saber.”<br><br>“That’s right,” said the man, whom Pétya took to be an hussar. “Was the<br>cup left here?”<br><br>“There, by the wheel!”<br><br>The hussar took the cup.<br><br>“It must be daylight soon,” said he, yawning, and went away.<br><br>Pétya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Denísov’s<br>guerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon<br>captured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that under<br>it Likhachëv was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark<br>blotch to the right was the watchman’s hut, and the red blotch below to<br>the left was the dying embers of a campfire, that the man who had come<br>for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink; but he neither knew nor<br>waited to know anything of all this. He was in a fairy kingdom where<br>nothing resembled reality. The big dark blotch might really be the<br>watchman’s hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of<br>the earth. Perhaps the red spot was a fire, or it might be the eye of an<br>enormous monster. Perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon, but it might<br>very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high<br>tower from which, if he fell, he would have to fall for a whole day or a<br>whole month, or go on falling and never reach the bottom. Perhaps it<br>was just the Cossack, Likhachëv, who was sitting under the wagon, but it<br>might be the kindest, bravest, most wonderful, most splendid man in the<br>world, whom no one knew of. It might really have been that the hussar<br>came for water and went back into the hollow, but perhaps he had simply<br>vanished—disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness.<br><br>Nothing Pétya could have seen now would have surprised him. He was in a<br>fairy kingdom where everything was possible.<br><br>He looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like the earth.<br>It was clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly<br>sailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked as if the clouds<br>were passing, and a clear black sky appeared. Sometimes it seemed as<br>if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed to be rising<br>high, high overhead, and then it seemed to sink so low that one could<br>touch it with one’s hand.<br><br>Pétya’s eyes began to close and he swayed a little.<br><br>The trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses neighed and<br>jostled one another. Someone snored.<br><br>“Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...” hissed the saber against the whetstone,<br>and suddenly Pétya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown,<br>sweetly solemn hymn. Pétya was as musical as Natásha and more so than<br>Nicholas, but had never learned music or thought about it, and so the<br>melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly<br>fresh and attractive. The music became more and more audible. The melody<br>grew and passed from one instrument to another. And what was played was<br>a fugue—though Pétya had not the least conception of what a fugue is.<br>Each instrument—now resembling a violin and now a horn, but better<br>and clearer than violin or horn—played its own part, and before it had<br>finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the<br>same air, and then with a third and a fourth; and they all blended into<br>one and again became separate and again blended, now into solemn church<br>music, now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant.<br><br>“Oh—why, that was in a dream!” Pétya said to himself, as he lurched<br>forward. “It’s in my ears. But perhaps it’s music of my own. Well, go<br>on, my music! Now!...”<br><br>He closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a distance, sounds<br>fluttered, grew into harmonies, separated, blended, and again all<br>mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn. “Oh, this is delightful!<br>As much as I like and as I like!” said Pétya to himself. He tried to<br>conduct that enormous orchestra.<br><br>“Now softly, softly die away!” and the sounds obeyed him. “Now fuller,<br>more joyful. Still more and more joyful!” And from an unknown depth rose<br>increasingly triumphant sounds. “Now voices join in!” ordered Pétya. And<br>at first from afar he heard men’s voices and then women’s. The voices<br>grew in harmonious triumphant strength, and Pétya listened to their<br>surpassing beauty in awe and joy.<br><br>With a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip from the<br>trees, and the hissing of the saber, “Ozheg-zheg-zheg...” and again the<br>horses jostled one another and neighed, not disturbing the choir but<br>joining in it.<br><br>Pétya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself all the<br>time, wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to<br>share it. He was awakened by Likhachëv’s kindly voice.<br><br>“It’s ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in half with it!”<br><br>Pétya woke up.<br><br>“It’s getting light, it’s really getting light!” he exclaimed.<br><br>The horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their<br>very tails, and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches.<br>Pétya shook himself, jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket and gave it<br>to Likhachëv; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and sheathed<br>it. The Cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle<br>girths.<br><br>“And here’s the commander,” said Likhachëv.<br><br>Denísov came out of the watchman’s hut and, having called Pétya, gave<br>orders to get ready.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>The men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness, tightened<br>their saddle girths, and formed companies. Denísov stood by the<br>watchman’s hut giving final orders. The infantry of the detachment<br>passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist<br>of early dawn, hundreds of feet splashing through the mud. The esaul<br>gave some orders to his men. Pétya held his horse by the bridle,<br>impatiently awaiting the order to mount. His face, having been bathed<br>in cold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were particularly brilliant.<br>Cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically.<br><br>“Well, is ev’wything weady?” asked Denísov. “Bwing the horses.”<br><br>The horses were brought. Denísov was angry with the Cossack because the<br>saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted. Pétya put his<br>foot in the stirrup. His horse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but<br>Pétya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and,<br>turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him, rode<br>up to Denísov.<br><br>“Vasíli Dmítrich, entrust me with some commission! Please... for God’s<br>sake...!” said he.<br><br>Denísov seemed to have forgotten Pétya’s very existence. He turned to<br>glance at him.<br><br>“I ask one thing of you,” he said sternly, “to obey me and not shove<br>yourself forward anywhere.”<br><br>He did not say another word to Pétya but rode in silence all the way.<br>When they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing<br>light over the field. Denísov talked in whispers with the esaul and<br>the Cossacks rode past Pétya and Denísov. When they had all ridden by,<br>Denísov touched his horse and rode down the hill. Slipping onto their<br>haunches and sliding, the horses descended with their riders into the<br>ravine. Pétya rode beside Denísov, the pulsation of his body constantly<br>increasing. It was getting lighter and lighter, but the mist still hid<br>distant objects. Having reached the valley, Denísov looked back and<br>nodded to a Cossack beside him.<br><br>“The signal!” said he.<br><br>The Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant the tramp<br>of horses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from various sides,<br>and then more shots.<br><br>At the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, Pétya lashed his<br>horse and loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding Denísov who<br>shouted at him. It seemed to Pétya that at the moment the shot was<br>fired it suddenly became as bright as noon. He galloped to the bridge.<br>Cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him. On the bridge<br>he collided with a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he galloped on.<br>In front of him soldiers, probably Frenchmen, were running from right<br>to left across the road. One of them fell in the mud under his horse’s<br>feet.<br><br>Cossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something. From the midst<br>of that crowd terrible screams arose. Pétya galloped up, and the<br>first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman,<br>clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him.<br><br>“Hurrah!... Lads!... ours!” shouted Pétya, and giving rein to his<br>excited horse he galloped forward along the village street.<br><br>He could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, hussars, and ragged<br>Russian prisoners, who had come running from both sides of the road,<br>were shouting something loudly and incoherently. A gallant-looking<br>Frenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red face,<br>had been defending himself against the hussars. When Pétya galloped<br>up the Frenchman had already fallen. “Too late again!” flashed through<br>Pétya’s mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing<br>could be heard. The shots came from the yard of the landowner’s house<br>he had visited the night before with Dólokhov. The French were making<br>a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with<br>bushes and were firing at the Cossacks who crowded at the gateway.<br>Through the smoke, as he approached the gate, Pétya saw Dólokhov, whose<br>face was of a pale-greenish tint, shouting to his men. “Go round! Wait<br>for the infantry!” he exclaimed as Pétya rode up to him.<br><br>“Wait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!” shouted Pétya, and without pausing a moment<br>galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the<br>smoke was thickest.<br><br>A volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while others plashed<br>against something. The Cossacks and Dólokhov galloped after Pétya into<br>the gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke some of the<br>French threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the<br>Cossacks, while others ran down the hill toward the pond. Pétya was<br>galloping along the courtyard, but instead of holding the reins he waved<br>both his arms about rapidly and strangely, slipping farther and farther<br>to one side in his saddle. His horse, having galloped up to a campfire<br>that was smoldering in the morning light, stopped suddenly, and Pétya<br>fell heavily on to the wet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and<br>legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless. A bullet had<br>pierced his skull.<br><br>After speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the house<br>with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that<br>they surrendered, Dólokhov dismounted and went up to Pétya, who lay<br>motionless with outstretched arms.<br><br>“Done for!” he said with a frown, and went to the gate to meet Denísov<br>who was riding toward him.<br><br>“Killed?” cried Denísov, recognizing from a distance the unmistakably<br>lifeless attitude—very familiar to him—in which Pétya’s body was lying.<br><br>“Done for!” repeated Dólokhov as if the utterance of these words<br>afforded him pleasure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, who<br>were surrounded by Cossacks who had hurried up. “We won’t take them!” he<br>called out to Denísov.<br><br>Denísov did not reply; he rode up to Pétya, dismounted, and with<br>trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained, mud-bespattered<br>face which had already gone white.<br><br>“I am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... take them all!” he<br>recalled Pétya’s words. And the Cossacks looked round in surprise at the<br>sound, like the yelp of a dog, with which Denísov turned away, walked to<br>the wattle fence, and seized hold of it.<br><br>Among the Russian prisoners rescued by Denísov and Dólokhov was Pierre<br>Bezúkhov.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>During the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders had been<br>issued by the French authorities concerning the party of prisoners<br>among whom was Pierre. On the twenty-second of October that party was<br>no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left<br>Moscow. Half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first<br>stages with them had been captured by Cossacks, the other half had gone<br>on ahead. Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in<br>front of the prisoners was left; they had all disappeared. The artillery<br>the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was<br>now replaced by Marshal Junot’s enormous baggage train, convoyed by<br>Westphalians. Behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train.<br><br>From Vyázma onwards the French army, which had till then moved in three<br>columns, went on as a single group. The symptoms of disorder that Pierre<br>had noticed at their first halting place after leaving Moscow had now<br>reached the utmost limit.<br><br>The road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead<br>horses; ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments<br>continually changed about, now joining the moving column, now again<br>lagging behind it.<br><br>Several times during the march false alarms had been given and the<br>soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets, fired, and run<br>headlong, crushing one another, but had afterwards reassembled and<br>abused each other for their causeless panic.<br><br>These three groups traveling together—the cavalry stores, the convoy of<br>prisoners, and Junot’s baggage train—still constituted a separate and<br>united whole, though each of the groups was rapidly melting away.<br><br>Of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and<br>twenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been<br>captured or left behind. Some of Junot’s wagons also had been captured<br>or abandoned. Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers<br>from Davout’s corps. From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned that<br>a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the<br>prisoners, and that one of their comrades, a German soldier, had been<br>shot by the marshal’s own order because a silver spoon belonging to the<br>marshal had been found in his possession.<br><br>The group of prisoners had melted away most of all. Of the three hundred<br>and thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a hundred now<br>remained. The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the<br>cavalry saddles or Junot’s baggage. They understood that the saddles and<br>Junot’s spoon might be of some use, but that cold and hungry soldiers<br>should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry Russians who<br>froze and lagged behind on the road (in which case the order was to<br>shoot them) was not merely incomprehensible but revolting. And the<br>escort, as if afraid, in the grievous condition they themselves were in,<br>of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering<br>their own plight still worse, treated them with particular moroseness<br>and severity.<br><br>At Dorogobúzh while the soldiers of the convoy, after locking the<br>prisoners in a stable, had gone off to pillage their own stores, several<br>of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away, but were<br>recaptured by the French and shot.<br><br>The arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer prisoners<br>should be kept separate from the rest, had long since been abandoned.<br>All who could walk went together, and after the third stage Pierre had<br>rejoined Karatáev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen<br>Karatáev for its master.<br><br>On the third day after leaving Moscow Karatáev again fell ill with the<br>fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as he grew<br>gradually weaker Pierre kept away from him. Pierre did not know why, but<br>since Karatáev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to<br>go near him. When he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which<br>Karatáev generally lay down at the halting places, and when he smelled<br>the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before, Pierre<br>moved farther away and did not think about him.<br><br>While imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his intellect<br>but with his whole being, by life itself, that man is created for<br>happiness, that happiness is within him, in the satisfaction of simple<br>human needs, and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from<br>superfluity. And now during these last three weeks of the march he had<br>learned still another new, consolatory truth—that nothing in this world<br>is terrible. He had learned that as there is no condition in which man<br>can be happy and entirely free, so there is no condition in which he<br>need be unhappy and lack freedom. He learned that suffering and freedom<br>have their limits and that those limits are very near together; that the<br>person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as<br>he now, sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled<br>while the other was warming; and that when he had put on tight dancing<br>shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet<br>that were covered with sores—his footgear having long since fallen to<br>pieces. He discovered that when he had married his wife—of his own free<br>will as it had seemed to him—he had been no more free than now when they<br>locked him up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself subsequently<br>termed his sufferings, but which at the time he scarcely felt, the worst<br>was the state of his bare, raw, and scab-covered feet. (The horseflesh<br>was appetizing and nourishing, the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder<br>they used instead of salt was even pleasant; there was no great cold,<br>it was always warm walking in the daytime, and at night there were the<br>campfires; the lice that devoured him warmed his body.) The one thing<br>that was at first hard to bear was his feet.<br><br>After the second day’s march Pierre, having examined his feet by the<br>campfire, thought it would be impossible to walk on them; but when<br>everybody got up he went along, limping, and, when he had warmed up,<br>walked without feeling the pain, though at night his feet were more<br>terrible to look at than before. However, he did not look at them now,<br>but thought of other things.<br><br>Only now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the<br>saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing<br>to another, which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows<br>superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit.<br><br>He did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged<br>behind, though more than a hundred perished in that way. He did not<br>think of Karatáev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon<br>have to share that fate. Still less did Pierre think about himself. The<br>harder his position became and the more terrible the future, the more<br>independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful<br>and comforting thoughts, memories, and imaginings that came to him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>At midday on the twenty-second of October Pierre was going uphill along<br>the muddy, slippery road, looking at his feet and at the roughness of<br>the way. Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and<br>then again at his feet. The former and the latter were alike familiar<br>and his own. The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side<br>of the road, sometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction<br>lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three, and then again going on<br>all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion. The<br>dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in Moscow. All around lay<br>the flesh of different animals—from men to horses—in various stages of<br>decomposition; and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the<br>dog could eat all it wanted.<br><br>It had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it<br>might cease and the sky clear, but after a short break it began raining<br>harder than before. The saturated road no longer absorbed the water,<br>which ran along the ruts in streams.<br><br>Pierre walked along, looking from side to side, counting his steps in<br>threes, and reckoning them off on his fingers. Mentally addressing the<br>rain, he repeated: “Now then, now then, go on! Pelt harder!”<br><br>It seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but far down and<br>deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and<br>comforting. This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a<br>conversation with Karatáev the day before.<br><br>At their yesterday’s halting place, feeling chilly by a dying campfire,<br>Pierre had got up and gone to the next one, which was burning better.<br>There Platón Karatáev was sitting covered up—head and all—with his<br>greatcoat as if it were a vestment, telling the soldiers in his<br>effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story Pierre knew. It<br>was already past midnight, the hour when Karatáev was usually free of<br>his fever and particularly lively. When Pierre reached the fire and<br>heard Platón’s voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his pathetic face<br>brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick at his heart. His<br>feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away,<br>but there was no other fire, and Pierre sat down, trying not to look at<br>Platón.<br><br>“Well, how are you?” he asked.<br><br>“How am I? If we grumble at sickness, God won’t grant us death,” replied<br>Platón, and at once resumed the story he had begun.<br><br>“And so, brother,” he continued, with a smile on his pale emaciated face<br>and a particularly happy light in his eyes, “you see, brother...”<br><br>Pierre had long been familiar with that story. Karatáev had told it<br>to him alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially joyful<br>emotion. But well as he knew it, Pierre now listened to that tale as to<br>something new, and the quiet rapture Karatáev evidently felt as he told<br>it communicated itself also to Pierre. The story was of an old merchant<br>who lived a good and God-fearing life with his family, and who went once<br>to the Nízhni fair with a companion—a rich merchant.<br><br>Having put up at an inn they both went to sleep, and next morning his<br>companion was found robbed and with his throat cut. A bloodstained knife<br>was found under the old merchant’s pillow. He was tried, knouted, and<br>his nostrils having been torn off, “all in due form” as Karatáev put it,<br>he was sent to hard labor in Siberia.<br><br>“And so, brother” (it was at this point that Pierre came up), “ten years<br>or more passed by. The old man was living as a convict, submitting as<br>he should and doing no wrong. Only he prayed to God for death. Well, one<br>night the convicts were gathered just as we are, with the old man among<br>them. And they began telling what each was suffering for, and how they<br>had sinned against God. One told how he had taken a life, another had<br>taken two, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply<br>been a vagrant and had done nothing. So they asked the old man: ‘What<br>are you being punished for, Daddy?’—‘I, my dear brothers,’ said he, ‘am<br>being punished for my own and other men’s sins. But I have not killed<br>anyone or taken anything that was not mine, but have only helped my<br>poorer brothers. I was a merchant, my dear brothers, and had much<br>property. ‘And he went on to tell them all about it in due order. ‘I<br>don’t grieve for myself,’ he says, ‘God, it seems, has chastened me.<br>Only I am sorry for my old wife and the children,’ and the old man began<br>to weep. Now it happened that in the group was the very man who had<br>killed the other merchant. ‘Where did it happen, Daddy?’ he said. ‘When,<br>and in what month?’ He asked all about it and his heart began to ache.<br>So he comes up to the old man like this, and falls down at his feet!<br>‘You are perishing because of me, Daddy,’ he says. ‘It’s quite true,<br>lads, that this man,’ he says, ‘is being tortured innocently and for<br>nothing! I,’ he says, ‘did that deed, and I put the knife under your<br>head while you were asleep. Forgive me, Daddy,’ he says, ‘for Christ’s<br>sake!’”<br><br>Karatáev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire, and he drew<br>the logs together.<br><br>“And the old man said, ‘God will forgive you, we are all sinners in His<br>sight. I suffer for my own sins,’ and he wept bitter tears. Well,<br>and what do you think, dear friends?” Karatáev continued, his face<br>brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had<br>to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story:<br>“What do you think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed to the<br>authorities. ‘I have taken six lives,’ he says (he was a great sinner),<br>‘but what I am most sorry for is this old man. Don’t let him suffer<br>because of me.’ So he confessed and it was all written down and the<br>papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and while<br>they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in the<br>papers all in due form—the authorities I mean—time passed. The affair<br>reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsar’s decree came: to set the<br>merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded. The<br>paper arrived and they began to look for the old man. ‘Where is the old<br>man who has been suffering innocently and in vain? A paper has come from<br>the Tsar!’ so they began looking for him,” here Karatáev’s lower jaw<br>trembled, “but God had already forgiven him—he was dead! That’s how it<br>was, dear fellows!” Karatáev concluded and sat for a long time silent,<br>gazing before him with a smile.<br><br>And Pierre’s soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself<br>but by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that lit up<br>Karatáev’s face as he told it, and the mystic significance of that joy.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>“À vos places!” * suddenly cried a voice.<br><br>    * “To your places.”<br><br><br>A pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something<br>joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the<br>prisoners. From all sides came shouts of command, and from the left came<br>smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing the prisoners at a<br>trot. The expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the<br>approach of those in authority. The prisoners thronged together and were<br>pushed off the road. The convoy formed up.<br><br>“The Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The Duke!” and hardly had the<br>sleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled<br>by. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with a<br>tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of the<br>marshals. His eye fell on Pierre’s large and striking figure, and in<br>the expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre thought he<br>detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy.<br><br>The general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a<br>red and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. Several officers<br>formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them. Their faces all<br>looked excited and worried.<br><br>“What did he say? What did he say?” Pierre heard them ask.<br><br>While the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together in a<br>crowd, and Pierre saw Karatáev whom he had not yet seen that morning.<br>He sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree. On his face,<br>besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling<br>the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently, there was now an<br>expression of quiet solemnity.<br><br>Karatáev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with<br>tears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to<br>him. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself. He made as if he<br>did not notice that look and moved hastily away.<br><br>When the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round. Karatáev<br>was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two<br>Frenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did not look round again<br>but went limping up the hill.<br><br>From behind, where Karatáev had been sitting, came the sound of a shot.<br>Pierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that he<br>had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to<br>Smolénsk—a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by. And he<br>again started reckoning. Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one of<br>whom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale, and<br>in the expression on their faces—one of them glanced timidly at<br>Pierre—there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of<br>the young soldier at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and<br>remembered that, two days before, that man had burned his shirt while<br>drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him.<br><br>Behind him, where Karatáev had been sitting, the dog began to howl.<br>“What a stupid beast! Why is it howling?” thought Pierre.<br><br>His comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided looking<br>back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling,<br>just as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their faces.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>The stores, the prisoners, and the marshal’s baggage train stopped at<br>the village of Shámshevo. The men crowded together round the campfires.<br>Pierre went up to the fire, ate some roast horseflesh, lay down with his<br>back to the fire, and immediately fell asleep. He again slept as he had<br>done at Mozháysk after the battle of Borodinó.<br><br>Again real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he or another,<br>gave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same thoughts that had<br>been expressed in his dream at Mozháysk.<br><br>“Life is everything. Life is God. Everything changes and moves and that<br>movement is God. And while there is life there is joy in consciousness<br>of the divine. To love life is to love God. Harder and more blessed<br>than all else is to love this life in one’s sufferings, in innocent<br>sufferings.”<br><br>“Karatáev!” came to Pierre’s mind.<br><br>And suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-forgotten, kindly old man<br>who had given him geography lessons in Switzerland. “Wait a bit,” said<br>the old man, and showed Pierre a globe. This globe was alive—a vibrating<br>ball without fixed dimensions. Its whole surface consisted of drops<br>closely pressed together, and all these drops moved and changed places,<br>sometimes several of them merging into one, sometimes one dividing<br>into many. Each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as<br>possible, but others striving to do the same compressed it, sometimes<br>destroyed it, and sometimes merged with it.<br><br>“That is life,” said the old teacher.<br><br>“How simple and clear it is,” thought Pierre. “How is it I did not know<br>it before?”<br><br>“God is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect<br>Him to the greatest extent. And it grows, merges, disappears from the<br>surface, sinks to the depths, and again emerges. There now, Karatáev<br>has spread out and disappeared. Do you understand, my child?” said the<br>teacher.<br><br>“Do you understand, damn you?” shouted a voice, and Pierre woke up.<br><br>He lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman who had just pushed a Russian<br>soldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting a piece<br>of meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy,<br>hairy, red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod. His<br>brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of<br>the charcoal.<br><br>“It’s all the same to him,” he muttered, turning quickly to a soldier<br>who stood behind him. “Brigand! Get away!”<br><br>And twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, who turned<br>away and gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier the<br>Frenchman had pushed away, was sitting near the fire patting something<br>with his hand. Looking more closely Pierre recognized the blue-gray dog,<br>sitting beside the soldier, wagging its tail.<br><br>“Ah, he’s come?” said Pierre. “And Plat—” he began, but did not finish.<br><br>Suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancy—of<br>the look Platón had given him as he sat under the tree, of the shot<br>heard from that spot, of the dog’s howl, of the guilty faces of the two<br>Frenchmen as they ran past him, of the lowered and smoking gun, and of<br>Karatáev’s absence at this halt—and he was on the point of realizing<br>that Karatáev had been killed, but just at that instant, he knew not<br>why, the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent<br>with a beautiful Polish lady on the veranda of his house in Kiev. And<br>without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion<br>from them, Pierre closed his eyes, seeing a vision of the country in<br>summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid, vibrating<br>globe, and he sank into water so that it closed over his head.<br><br>Before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing.<br>French soldiers were running past him.<br><br>“The Cossacks!” one of them shouted, and a moment later a crowd of<br>Russians surrounded Pierre.<br><br>For a long time he could not understand what was happening to him. All<br>around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy.<br><br>“Brothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!” old soldiers exclaimed, weeping, as<br>they embraced Cossacks and hussars.<br><br>The hussars and Cossacks crowded round the prisoners; one offered them<br>clothes, another boots, and a third bread. Pierre sobbed as he sat<br>among them and could not utter a word. He hugged the first soldier who<br>approached him, and kissed him, weeping.<br><br>Dólokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting a crowd<br>of disarmed Frenchmen pass by. The French, excited by all that had<br>happened, were talking loudly among themselves, but as they passed<br>Dólokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them<br>with cold glassy eyes that boded no good, they became silent. On the<br>opposite side stood Dólokhov’s Cossack, counting the prisoners and<br>marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate.<br><br>“How many?” Dólokhov asked the Cossack.<br><br>“The second hundred,” replied the Cossack.<br><br>“Filez, filez!” * Dólokhov kept saying, having adopted this expression<br>from the French, and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they<br>flashed with a cruel light.<br><br>    * “Get along, get along!”<br><br><br>Denísov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some Cossacks<br>who were carrying the body of Pétya Rostóv to a hole that had been dug<br>in the garden.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>After the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began, the flight of<br>the French assumed a still more tragic character, with men freezing,<br>or roasting themselves to death at the campfires, while carriages<br>with people dressed in furs continued to drive past, carrying away the<br>property that had been stolen by the Emperor, kings, and dukes; but<br>the process of the flight and disintegration of the French army went on<br>essentially as before.<br><br>From Moscow to Vyázma the French army of seventy-three thousand men not<br>reckoning the Guards (who did nothing during the whole war but pillage)<br>was reduced to thirty-six thousand, though not more than five thousand<br>had fallen in battle. From this beginning the succeeding terms of the<br>progression could be determined mathematically. The French army melted<br>away and perished at the same rate from Moscow to Vyázma, from Vyázma<br>to Smolénsk, from Smolénsk to the Berëzina, and from the Berëzina to<br>Vílna—independently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold, the<br>pursuit, the barring of the way, or any other particular conditions.<br>Beyond Vyázma the French army instead of moving in three columns huddled<br>together into one mass, and so went on to the end. Berthier wrote to his<br>Emperor (we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to diverge<br>from the truth in describing the condition of an army) and this is what<br>he said:<br><br><br>I deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the condition of the various<br>corps I have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last<br>two or three days’ march. They are almost disbanded. Scarcely a quarter<br>of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments, the others<br>go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and<br>escape discipline. In general they regard Smolénsk as the place where<br>they hope to recover. During the last few days many of the men have been<br>seen to throw away their cartridges and their arms. In such a state<br>of affairs, whatever your ultimate plans may be, the interest of Your<br>Majesty’s service demands that the army should be rallied at Smolénsk<br>and should first of all be freed from ineffectives, such as dismounted<br>cavalry, unnecessary baggage, and artillery material that is no longer<br>in proportion to the present forces. The soldiers, who are worn out with<br>hunger and fatigue, need these supplies as well as a few days’ rest.<br>Many have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs. This<br>state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that<br>unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under<br>control in case of an engagement.<br><br>November 9: twenty miles from Smolénsk.<br><br><br>After staggering into Smolénsk which seemed to them a promised land, the<br>French, searching for food, killed one another, sacked their own stores,<br>and when everything had been plundered fled farther.<br><br>They all went without knowing whither or why they were going. Still less<br>did that genius, Napoleon, know it, for no one issued any orders to<br>him. But still he and those about him retained their old habits: wrote<br>commands, letters, reports, and orders of the day; called one another<br>sire, mon cousin, prince d’Eckmühl, roi de Naples, and so on. But these<br>orders and reports were only on paper, nothing in them was acted upon<br>for they could not be carried out, and though they entitled one<br>another Majesties, Highnesses, or Cousins, they all felt that they were<br>miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to<br>pay. And though they pretended to be concerned about the army, each<br>was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save<br>himself.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVII<br><br>The movements of the Russian and French armies during the campaign<br>from Moscow back to the Niemen were like those in a game of Russian<br>blindman’s buff, in which two players are blindfolded and one of<br>them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his<br>whereabouts. First he rings his bell fearlessly, but when he gets into<br>a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can, and often thinking to<br>escape runs straight into his opponent’s arms.<br><br>At first while they were still moving along the Kalúga road, Napoleon’s<br>armies made their presence known, but later when they reached the<br>Smolénsk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight—and often<br>thinking they were escaping ran right into the Russians.<br><br>Owing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian pursuit<br>and the consequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief means of<br>approximately ascertaining the enemy’s position—by cavalry scouting—was<br>not available. Besides, as a result of the frequent and rapid change of<br>position by each army, even what information was obtained could not be<br>delivered in time. If news was received one day that the enemy had been<br>in a certain position the day before, by the third day when something<br>could have been done, that army was already two days’ march farther on<br>and in quite another position.<br><br>One army fled and the other pursued. Beyond Smolénsk there were several<br>different roads available for the French, and one would have thought<br>that during their stay of four days they might have learned where<br>the enemy was, might have arranged some more advantageous plan and<br>undertaken something new. But after a four days’ halt the mob, with no<br>maneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten track, neither<br>to the right nor to the left but along the old—the worst—road, through<br>Krásnoe and Orshá.<br><br>Expecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French separated<br>in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty-four hours. In<br>front of them all fled the Emperor, then the kings, then the dukes. The<br>Russian army, expecting Napoleon to take the road to the right beyond<br>the Dnieper—which was the only reasonable thing for him to do—themselves<br>turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at Krásnoe. And here<br>as in a game of blindman’s buff the French ran into our vanguard. Seeing<br>their enemy unexpectedly the French fell into confusion and stopped<br>short from the sudden fright, but then they resumed their flight,<br>abandoning their comrades who were farther behind. Then for three days<br>separate portions of the French army—first Murat’s (the vice-king’s),<br>then Davout’s, and then Ney’s—ran, as it were, the gauntlet of the<br>Russian army. They abandoned one another, abandoned all their heavy<br>baggage, their artillery, and half their men, and fled, getting past the<br>Russians by night by making semicircles to the right.<br><br>Ney, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the walls of<br>Smolénsk which were in nobody’s way, because despite the unfortunate<br>plight of the French or because of it, they wished to punish the floor<br>against which they had hurt themselves. Ney, who had had a corps of ten<br>thousand men, reached Napoleon at Orshá with only one thousand men left,<br>having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon, and having crossed the<br>Dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot.<br><br>From Orshá they fled farther along the road to Vílna, still playing<br>at blindman’s buff with the pursuing army. At the Berëzina they again<br>became disorganized, many were drowned and many surrendered, but those<br>who got across the river fled farther. Their supreme chief donned a<br>fur coat and, having seated himself in a sleigh, galloped on alone,<br>abandoning his companions. The others who could do so drove away too,<br>leaving those who could not to surrender or die.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>This campaign consisted in a flight of the French during which they did<br>all they could to destroy themselves. From the time they turned onto<br>the Kalúga road to the day their leader fled from the army, none of the<br>movements of the crowd had any sense. So one might have thought that<br>regarding this period of the campaign the historians, who attributed<br>the actions of the mass to the will of one man, would have found it<br>impossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory. But<br>no! Mountains of books have been written by the historians about this<br>campaign, and everywhere are described Napoleon’s arrangements, the<br>maneuvers, and his profound plans which guided the army, as well as the<br>military genius shown by his marshals.<br><br>The retreat from Málo-Yaroslávets when he had a free road into a<br>well-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along<br>which Kutúzov afterwards pursued him—this unnecessary retreat along<br>a devastated road—is explained to us as being due to profound<br>considerations. Similarly profound considerations are given for<br>his retreat from Smolénsk to Orshá. Then his heroism at Krásnoe is<br>described, where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle<br>and take personal command, and to have walked about with a birch stick<br>and said:<br><br>“J’ai assez fait l’empereur; il est temps de faire le général,” * but<br>nevertheless immediately ran away again, abandoning to its fate the<br>scattered fragments of the army he left behind.<br><br>     * “I have acted the Emperor long enough; it is time to act<br>     the general.”<br><br><br>Then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals, especially<br>of Ney—a greatness of soul consisting in this: that he made his way by<br>night around through the forest and across the Dnieper and escaped to<br>Orshá, abandoning standards, artillery, and nine tenths of his men.<br><br>And lastly, the final departure of the great Emperor from his heroic<br>army is presented to us by the historians as something great and<br>characteristic of genius. Even that final running away, described in<br>ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child<br>is taught to be ashamed of—even that act finds justification in the<br>historians’ language.<br><br>When it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical<br>ratiocination any farther, when actions are clearly contrary to all<br>that humanity calls right or even just, the historians produce a saving<br>conception of “greatness.” “Greatness,” it seems, excludes the standards<br>of right and wrong. For the “great” man nothing is wrong, there is no<br>atrocity for which a “great” man can be blamed.<br><br>“C’est grand!” * say the historians, and there no longer exists either<br>good or evil but only “grand” and “not grand.” Grand is good, not<br>grand is bad. Grand is the characteristic, in their conception, of some<br>special animals called “heroes.” And Napoleon, escaping home in a warm<br>fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades<br>but were (in his opinion) men he had brought there, feels que c’est<br>grand, *(2) and his soul is tranquil.<br><br>     * “It is great.”<br><br>     * (2) That it is great.<br><br>“Du sublime (he saw something sublime in himself) au ridicule il n’y<br>a qu’un pas,” * said he. And the whole world for fifty years has been<br>repeating: “Sublime! Grand! Napoléon le Grand!” Du sublime au ridicule<br>il n’y a qu’un pas.<br><br>    * “From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step.”<br><br><br>And it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with<br>the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit one’s own nothingness<br>and immeasurable meanness.<br><br>For us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, no human<br>actions are incommensurable. And there is no greatness where simplicity,<br>goodness, and truth are absent.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIX<br><br>What Russian, reading the account of the last part of the campaign<br>of 1812, has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret,<br>dissatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not asked himself how it is<br>that the French were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies<br>surrounded them in superior numbers, when the disordered French, hungry<br>and freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as the historians relate)<br>the aim of the Russians was to stop the French, to cut them off, and<br>capture them all?<br><br>How was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker than the<br>French had given battle at Borodinó, did not achieve its purpose when it<br>had surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim was to capture<br>them? Can the French be so enormously superior to us that when we had<br>surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them? How could<br>that happen?<br><br>History (or what is called by that name) replying to these questions<br>says that this occurred because Kutúzov and Tormásov and Chichagóv, and<br>this man and that man, did not execute such and such maneuvers....<br><br>But why did they not execute those maneuvers? And why if they were<br>guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and<br>punished? But even if we admitted that Kutúzov, Chichagóv, and others<br>were the cause of the Russian failures, it is still incomprehensible<br>why, the position of the Russian army being what it was at Krásnoe and<br>at the Berëzina (in both cases we had superior forces), the French army<br>with its marshals, kings, and Emperor was not captured, if that was what<br>the Russians aimed at.<br><br>The explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military<br>historians (to the effect that Kutúzov hindered an attack) is unfounded,<br>for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at<br>Vyázma and Tarútino.<br><br>Why was the Russian army—which with inferior forces had withstood the<br>enemy in full strength at Borodinó—defeated at Krásnoe and the Berëzina<br>by the disorganized crowds of the French when it was numerically<br>superior?<br><br>If the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing<br>Napoleon and his marshals—and that aim was not merely frustrated but all<br>attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled—then this last period<br>of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the French to be a<br>series of victories, and quite wrongly considered victorious by Russian<br>historians.<br><br>The Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims<br>of logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical<br>rhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly admit<br>that the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for<br>Napoleon and defeats for Kutúzov.<br><br>But putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a<br>conclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of French<br>victories brought the French complete destruction, while the series<br>of Russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the<br>liberation of their country.<br><br>The source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians<br>studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals,<br>from memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth, have attributed to this<br>last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed, namely that of<br>cutting off and capturing Napoleon with his marshals and his army.<br><br>There never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have been<br>senseless and its attainment quite impossible.<br><br>It would have been senseless, first because Napoleon’s disorganized<br>army was flying from Russia with all possible speed, that is to say, was<br>doing just what every Russian desired. So what was the use of performing<br>various operations on the French who were running away as fast as they<br>possibly could?<br><br>Secondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose<br>whole energy was directed to flight.<br><br>Thirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice one’s own troops in<br>order to destroy the French army, which without external interference<br>was destroying itself at such a rate that, though its path was not<br>blocked, it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually<br>did in December, namely a hundredth part of the original army.<br><br>Fourthly, it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the<br>Emperor, kings, and dukes—whose capture would have been in the highest<br>degree embarrassing for the Russians, as the most adroit diplomatists of<br>the time (Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized. Still more senseless<br>would have been the wish to capture army corps of the French, when our<br>own army had melted away to half before reaching Krásnoe and a whole<br>division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners, and<br>when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners<br>already taken were perishing of hunger.<br><br>All the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his<br>army were like the plan of a market gardener who, when driving out of<br>his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted, should<br>run to the gate and hit the cow on the head. The only thing to be said<br>in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry. But not even<br>that could be said for those who drew up this project, for it was not<br>they who had suffered from the trampled beds.<br><br>But besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would have<br>been senseless, it was impossible.<br><br>It was impossible first because—as experience shows that a three-mile<br>movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans—the<br>probability of Chichagóv, Kutúzov, and Wittgenstein effecting a junction<br>on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to<br>impossibility, as in fact thought Kutúzov, who when he received the plan<br>remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the<br>desired results.<br><br>Secondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum with which<br>Napoleon’s army was retiring, incomparably greater forces than the<br>Russians possessed would have been required.<br><br>Thirdly it was impossible, because the military term “to cut off” has no<br>meaning. One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army. To cut off<br>an army—to bar its road—is quite impossible, for there is always plenty<br>of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be<br>seen, as the military scientists might convince themselves by the<br>example of Krásnoe and of the Berëzina. It is only possible to capture<br>prisoners if they agree to be captured, just as it is only possible<br>to catch a swallow if it settles on one’s hand. Men can only be taken<br>prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and<br>tactics, as the Germans did. But the French troops quite rightly did not<br>consider that this suited them, since death by hunger and cold awaited<br>them in flight or captivity alike.<br><br>Fourthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since the world<br>began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained<br>in 1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit of the French strained its<br>strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying<br>itself.<br><br>During the movement of the Russian army from Tarútino to Krásnoe it<br>lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal to the<br>population of a large provincial town. Half the men fell out of the army<br>without a battle.<br><br>And it is of this period of the campaign—when the army lacked boots<br>and sheepskin coats, was short of provisions and without vodka, and<br>was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees<br>of frost, when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and<br>the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be<br>maintained, when men were taken into that region of death where<br>discipline fails, not for a few hours only as in a battle, but for<br>months, where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and<br>cold, when half the army perished in a single month—it is of this period<br>of the campaign that the historians tell us how Milorádovich should have<br>made a flank march to such and such a place, Tormásov to another place,<br>and Chichagóv should have crossed (more than knee-deep in snow) to<br>somewhere else, and how so-and-so “routed” and “cut off” the French and<br>so on and so on.<br><br>The Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should have been<br>done to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they are not to blame<br>because other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposed that they should<br>do what was impossible.<br><br>All that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the<br>facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians<br>dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words<br>and sentiments of various generals, and not the history of the events.<br><br>To them the words of Milorádovich seem very interesting, and so do their<br>surmises and the rewards this or that general received; but the question<br>of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves<br>does not even interest them, for it does not come within the range of<br>their investigation.<br><br>Yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and<br>consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a<br>direct part in the events, and all the questions that seemed insoluble<br>easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution.<br><br>The aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed except in<br>the imaginations of a dozen people. It could not exist because it was<br>senseless and unattainable.<br><br>The people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion. That aim<br>was attained in the first place of itself, as the French ran away,<br>and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight. Secondly it was<br>attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the French, and<br>thirdly by the fact that a large Russian army was following the French,<br>ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped.<br><br>The Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal.

But when it is a<br>beloved and intimate human being that is dying, besides this horror at<br>the extinction of life there is a severance, a spiritual wound, which<br>like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals, but always<br>aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch.<br><br>After Prince Andrew’s death Natásha and Princess Mary alike felt this.<br>Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of<br>death that overhung them, they dared not look life in the face. They<br>carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact.<br>Everything: a carriage passing rapidly in the street, a summons to<br>dinner, the maid’s inquiry what dress to prepare, or worse still any<br>word of insincere or feeble sympathy, seemed an insult, painfully<br>irritated the wound, interrupting that necessary quiet in which<br>they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still<br>resounded in their imagination, and hindered their gazing into those<br>mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before<br>them.<br><br>Only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain.<br>They spoke little even to one another, and when they did it was of very<br>unimportant matters.<br><br>Both avoided any allusion to the future. To admit the possibility of<br>a future seemed to them to insult his memory. Still more carefully did<br>they avoid anything relating to him who was dead. It seemed to them that<br>what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in<br>words, and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the<br>majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before<br>their eyes.<br><br>Continued abstention from speech, and constant avoidance of everything<br>that might lead up to the subject—this halting on all sides at the<br>boundary of what they might not mention—brought before their minds with<br>still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling.<br><br>But pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy.<br>Princess Mary, in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of<br>her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew, was the first to<br>be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt<br>for the first fortnight. She received letters from her relations to<br>which she had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas had been put<br>was damp and he began to cough; Alpátych came to Yaroslávl with reports<br>on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they<br>should return to Moscow to the house on the Vozdvízhenka Street, which<br>had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs. Life did not<br>stand still and it was necessary to live. Hard as it was for Princess<br>Mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she<br>had lived till then, and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave<br>Natásha alone, yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she<br>involuntarily yielded to them. She went through the accounts with<br>Alpátych, conferred with Dessalles about her nephew, and gave orders and<br>made preparations for the journey to Moscow.<br><br>Natásha remained alone and, from the time Princess Mary began making<br>preparations for departure, held aloof from her too.<br><br>Princess Mary asked the countess to let Natásha go with her to Moscow,<br>and both parents gladly accepted this offer, for they saw their daughter<br>losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the<br>advice of Moscow doctors would be good for her.<br><br>“I am not going anywhere,” Natásha replied when this was proposed to<br>her. “Do please just leave me alone!” And she ran out of the room, with<br>difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than<br>of sorrow.<br><br>After she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her grief,<br>Natásha spent most of the time in her room by herself, sitting huddled<br>up feet and all in the corner of the sofa, tearing and twisting<br>something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and<br>fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. This solitude exhausted<br>and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it. As soon as anyone<br>entered she got up quickly, changed her position and expression, and<br>picked up a book or some sewing, evidently waiting impatiently for the<br>intruder to go.<br><br>She felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that<br>on which—with a terrible questioning too great for her strength—her<br>spiritual gaze was fixed.<br><br>One day toward the end of December Natásha, pale and thin, dressed in a<br>black woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot, was<br>crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, nervously crumpling and<br>smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the<br>door.<br><br>She was gazing in the direction in which he had gone—to the other side<br>of life. And that other side of life, of which she had never before<br>thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable,<br>was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of<br>life, where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering<br>and indignity.<br><br>She was gazing where she knew him to be; but she could not imagine him<br>otherwise than as he had been here. She now saw him again as he had been<br>at Mytíshchi, at Tróitsa, and at Yaroslávl.<br><br>She saw his face, heard his voice, repeated his words and her own, and<br>sometimes devised other words they might have spoken.<br><br>There he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak, leaning<br>his head on his thin pale hand. His chest is dreadfully hollow and his<br>shoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his eyes glitter, and a<br>wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead. One of his legs twitches<br>just perceptibly, but rapidly. Natásha knows that he is struggling with<br>terrible pain. “What is that pain like? Why does he have that pain? What<br>does he feel? How does it hurt him?” thought Natásha. He noticed her<br>watching him, raised his eyes, and began to speak seriously:<br><br>“One thing would be terrible,” said he: “to bind oneself forever to a<br>suffering man. It would be continual torture.” And he looked searchingly<br>at her. Natásha as usual answered before she had time to think what she<br>would say. She said: “This can’t go on—it won’t. You will get well—quite<br>well.”<br><br>She now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she<br>had then felt. She recalled his long sad and severe look at those words<br>and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted<br>gaze.<br><br>“I agreed,” Natásha now said to herself, “that it would be dreadful if<br>he always continued to suffer. I said it then only because it would have<br>been dreadful for him, but he understood it differently. He thought it<br>would be dreadful for me. He then still wished to live and feared death.<br>And I said it so awkwardly and stupidly! I did not say what I meant.<br>I thought quite differently. Had I said what I thought, I should have<br>said: even if he had to go on dying, to die continually before my eyes,<br>I should have been happy compared with what I am now. Now there is<br>nothing... nobody. Did he know that? No, he did not and never will know<br>it. And now it will never, never be possible to put it right.” And<br>now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her, only in her<br>imagination Natásha this time gave him a different answer. She stopped<br>him and said: “Terrible for you, but not for me! You know that for me<br>there is nothing in life but you, and to suffer with you is the greatest<br>happiness for me,” and he took her hand and pressed it as he had<br>pressed it that terrible evening four days before his death. And in her<br>imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have<br>said then but only spoke now: “I love thee!... thee! I love, love...”<br>she said, convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a<br>desperate effort....<br><br>She was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her<br>eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this.<br>Again everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and again with a<br>strained frown she peered toward the world where he was. And now, now<br>it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery.... But at the instant<br>when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a<br>loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears. Dunyásha,<br>her maid, entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look<br>on her face and showing no concern for her mistress.<br><br>“Come to your Papa at once, please!” said she with a strange, excited<br>look. “A misfortune... about Peter Ilýnich... a letter,” she finished<br>with a sob.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>Besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody Natásha was feeling a<br>special estrangement from the members of her own family. All of<br>them—her father, mother, and Sónya—were so near to her, so familiar, so<br>commonplace, that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the<br>world in which she had been living of late, and she felt not merely<br>indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility. She heard<br>Dunyásha’s words about Peter Ilýnich and a misfortune, but did not grasp<br>them.<br><br>“What misfortune? What misfortune can happen to them? They just live<br>their own old, quiet, and commonplace life,” thought Natásha.<br><br>As she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of<br>her mother’s room. His face was puckered up and wet with tears. He<br>had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were<br>choking him. When he saw Natásha he waved his arms despairingly and<br>burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face.<br><br>“Pe... Pétya... Go, go, she... is calling...” and weeping like a child<br>and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair, he almost fell into<br>it, covering his face with his hands.<br><br>Suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through Natásha’s whole being.<br>Terrible anguish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful ache as if<br>something was being torn inside her and she were dying. But the pain<br>was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive<br>constraint that had prevented her taking part in life. The sight of her<br>father, the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the<br>door, made her immediately forget herself and her own grief.<br><br>She ran to her father, but he feebly waved his arm, pointing to her<br>mother’s door. Princess Mary, pale and with quivering chin, came out<br>from that room and taking Natásha by the arm said something to her.<br>Natásha neither saw nor heard her. She went in with rapid steps, pausing<br>at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself, and then ran<br>to her mother.<br><br>The countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position,<br>stretching out and beating her head against the wall. Sónya and the<br>maids were holding her arms.<br><br>“Natásha! Natásha!...” cried the countess. “It’s not true... it’s not<br>true... He’s lying... Natásha!” she shrieked, pushing those around her<br>away. “Go away, all of you; it’s not true! Killed!... ha, ha, ha!...<br>It’s not true!”<br><br>Natásha put one knee on the armchair, stooped over her mother, embraced<br>her, and with unexpected strength raised her, turned her face toward<br>herself, and clung to her.<br><br>“Mummy!... darling!... I am here, my dearest Mummy,” she kept on<br>whispering, not pausing an instant.<br><br>She did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her,<br>demanded a pillow and hot water, and unfastened and tore open her<br>mother’s dress.<br><br>“My dearest darling... Mummy, my precious!...” she whispered<br>incessantly, kissing her head, her hands, her face, and feeling her own<br>irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks.<br><br>The countess pressed her daughter’s hand, closed her eyes, and became<br>quiet for a moment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness,<br>glanced vacantly around her, and seeing Natásha began to press her<br>daughter’s head with all her strength. Then she turned toward her<br>daughter’s face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it.<br><br>“Natásha, you love me?” she said in a soft trustful whisper. “Natásha,<br>you would not deceive me? You’ll tell me the whole truth?”<br><br>Natásha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was<br>nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness.<br><br>“My darling Mummy!” she repeated, straining all the power of her love to<br>find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her<br>mother.<br><br>And again in a futile struggle with reality her mother, refusing to<br>believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom<br>of life, escaped from reality into a world of delirium.<br><br>Natásha did not remember how that day passed nor that night, nor the<br>next day and night. She did not sleep and did not leave her mother. Her<br>persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess<br>every moment, not explaining or consoling, but recalling her to life.<br><br>During the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes,<br>and Natásha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes,<br>but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak. The countess was<br>sitting up in bed and speaking softly.<br><br>“How glad I am you have come. You are tired. Won’t you have some tea?”<br>Natásha went up to her. “You have improved in looks and grown more<br>manly,” continued the countess, taking her daughter’s hand.<br><br>“Mamma! What are you saying...”<br><br>“Natásha, he is no more, no more!”<br><br>And embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for the first<br>time.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>Princess Mary postponed her departure. Sónya and the count tried to<br>replace Natásha but could not. They saw that she alone was able to<br>restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For three weeks Natásha<br>remained constantly at her mother’s side, sleeping on a lounge chair<br>in her room, making her eat and drink, and talking to her incessantly<br>because the mere sound of her tender, caressing tones soothed her<br>mother.<br><br>The mother’s wounded spirit could not heal. Pétya’s death had torn from<br>her half her life. When the news of Pétya’s death had come she had been<br>a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room<br>a listless old woman taking no interest in life. But the same blow that<br>almost killed the countess, this second blow, restored Natásha to life.<br><br>A spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like<br>a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may<br>heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet<br>heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within.<br><br>Natásha’s wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended,<br>but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of<br>life—love—was still active within her. Love awoke and so did life.<br><br>Prince Andrew’s last days had bound Princess Mary and Natásha together;<br>this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. Princess Mary<br>put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after Natásha as if<br>she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her mother’s bedroom<br>had strained Natásha’s physical strength.<br><br>One afternoon noticing Natásha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took<br>her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Natásha lay down,<br>but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she<br>called her back.<br><br>“I don’t want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.”<br><br>“You are tired—try to sleep.”<br><br>“No, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.”<br><br>“She is much better. She spoke so well today,” said Princess Mary.<br><br>Natásha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned<br>Princess Mary’s face.<br><br>“Is she like him?” thought Natásha. “Yes, like and yet not like. But she<br>is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. What<br>is in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind like? What<br>does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!”<br><br>“Mary,” she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary’s hand to herself,<br>“Mary, you mustn’t think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love you!<br>Let us be quite, quite friends.”<br><br>And Natásha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making<br>Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings.<br><br>From that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only<br>between women was established between Princess Mary and Natásha. They<br>were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and<br>spent most of their time together. When one went out the other became<br>restless and hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt more in harmony<br>with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone. A<br>feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them; an exclusive<br>feeling of life being possible only in each other’s presence.<br><br>Sometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they were already<br>in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning. They spoke most<br>of what was long past. Princess Mary spoke of her childhood, of her<br>mother, her father, and her daydreams; and Natásha, who with a passive<br>lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of<br>devotion, submission, and the poetry of Christian self-sacrifice, now<br>feeling herself bound to Princess Mary by affection, learned to love her<br>past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to<br>her. She did not think of applying submission and self-abnegation to her<br>own life, for she was accustomed to seek other joys, but she understood<br>and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues. For<br>Princess Mary, listening to Natásha’s tales of childhood and early<br>youth, there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of<br>life: belief in life and its enjoyment.<br><br>Just as before, they never mentioned him so as not to lower (as they<br>thought) their exalted feelings by words; but this silence about him had<br>the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being<br>conscious of it.<br><br>Natásha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all<br>talked about her health, and this pleased her. But sometimes she was<br>suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness, weakness,<br>and loss of good looks, and involuntarily she examined her bare arm<br>carefully, surprised at its thinness, and in the morning noticed her<br>drawn and, as it seemed to her, piteous face in her glass. It seemed to<br>her that things must be so, and yet it was dreadfully sad.<br><br>One day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath.<br>Unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down, and<br>then, testing her strength, ran upstairs again, observing the result.<br><br>Another time when she called Dunyásha her voice trembled, so she called<br>again—though she could hear Dunyásha coming—called her in the deep chest<br>tones in which she had been wont to sing, and listened attentively to<br>herself.<br><br>She did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the layer<br>of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable, delicate<br>young shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking root would so<br>cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that<br>it would soon no longer be seen or noticed. The wound had begun to heal<br>from within.<br><br>At the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count<br>insisted on Natásha’s going with her to consult the doctors.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>After the encounter at Vyázma, where Kutúzov had been unable to hold<br>back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and<br>so on, the farther movement of the fleeing French, and of the Russians<br>who pursued them, continued as far as Krásnoe without a battle. The<br>flight was so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the French could<br>not keep up with them; cavalry and artillery horses broke down, and the<br>information received of the movements of the French was never reliable.<br><br>The men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching<br>at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not go any<br>faster.<br><br>To realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only<br>necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not<br>losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after Tarútino and<br>less than a hundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that place a<br>hundred thousand strong reached Krásnoe with only fifty thousand.<br><br>The rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army<br>as the flight of the French was to theirs. The only difference was that<br>the Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of destruction<br>as hung over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind<br>in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind were among their<br>own people. The chief cause of the wastage of Napoleon’s army was<br>the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing proof of this is the<br>corresponding decrease of the Russian army.<br><br>Kutúzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the<br>movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian<br>army generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at<br>Tarútino and Vyázma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of our<br>army.<br><br>But besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the<br>army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident, another<br>reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to Kutúzov.<br>The aim of the Russian army was to pursue the French. The road the<br>French would take was unknown, and so the closer our troops trod on<br>their heels the greater distance they had to cover. Only by following<br>at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the French. All<br>the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of<br>the army and a lengthening of its marches, whereas the only reasonable<br>aim was to shorten those marches. To that end Kutúzov’s activity was<br>directed during the whole campaign from Moscow to Vílna—not casually or<br>intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it.<br><br>Kutúzov felt and knew—not by reasoning or science but with the whole of<br>his Russian being—what every Russian soldier felt: that the French were<br>beaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven out; but at the<br>same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march,<br>the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year.<br><br>But to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian army,<br>who wished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, and for some<br>reason to capture a king or a duke—it seemed that now—when any battle<br>must be horrible and senseless—was the very time to fight and conquer<br>somebody. Kutúzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after<br>another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those<br>soldiers—ill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starved—who within a<br>month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number,<br>and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater<br>distance than they had already traversed, before they reached the<br>frontier.<br><br>This longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow, and<br>to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians stumbled on<br>the French army.<br><br>So it was at Krásnoe, where they expected to find one of the three<br>French columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen<br>thousand men. Despite all Kutúzov’s efforts to avoid that ruinous<br>encounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob<br>of French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued at Krásnoe for three<br>days.<br><br>Toll wrote a disposition: “The first column will march to so and so,”<br>etc. And as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition.<br>Prince Eugène of Württemberg fired from a hill over the French crowds<br>that were running past, and demanded reinforcements which did not<br>arrive. The French, avoiding the Russians, dispersed and hid themselves<br>in the forest by night, making their way round as best they could, and<br>continued their flight.<br><br>Milorádovich, who said he did not want to know anything about the<br>commissariat affairs of his detachment, and could never be found when<br>he was wanted—that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche * as he styled<br>himself—who was fond of parleys with the French, sent envoys demanding<br>their surrender, wasted time, and did not do what he was ordered to do.<br><br>    * Knight without fear and without reproach.<br><br>“I give you that column, lads,” he said, riding up to the troops and<br>pointing out the French to the cavalry.<br><br>And the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could<br>scarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented<br>to them—that is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold,<br>frost-bitten, and starving—and the column that had been presented to<br>them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to<br>do.<br><br>At Krásnoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners, several hundred<br>cannon, and a stick called a “marshal’s staff,” and disputed as to who<br>had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievement—though<br>they much regretted not having taken Napoleon, or at least a marshal or<br>a hero of some sort, and reproached one another and especially Kutúzov<br>for having failed to do so.<br><br>These men, carried away by their passions, were but blind tools of the<br>most melancholy law of necessity, but considered themselves heroes and<br>imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable<br>deed. They blamed Kutúzov and said that from the very beginning of the<br>campaign he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he thought of<br>nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the Linen<br>Factories because he was comfortable there, that at Krásnoe he checked<br>the advance because on learning that Napoleon was there he had quite<br>lost his head, and that it was probable that he had an understanding<br>with Napoleon and had been bribed by him, and so on, and so on.<br><br>Not only did his contemporaries, carried away by their passions, talk<br>in this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon as grand,<br>while Kutúzov is described by foreigners as a crafty, dissolute, weak<br>old courtier, and by Russians as something indefinite—a sort of puppet<br>useful only because he had a Russian name.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>In 1812 and 1813 Kutúzov was openly accused of blundering. The Emperor<br>was dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently written by order<br>of the Highest Authorities it is said that Kutúzov was a cunning court<br>liar, frightened of the name of Napoleon, and that by his blunders at<br>Krásnoe and the Berëzina he deprived the Russian army of the glory of<br>complete victory over the French. *<br><br>     * History of the year 1812. The character of Kutúzov and<br>     reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at<br>     Krásnoe, by Bogdánovich.<br><br>Such is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the Russian mind<br>does not acknowledge, but of those rare and always solitary individuals<br>who, discerning the will of Providence, submit their personal will to<br>it. The hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning<br>the higher laws.<br><br>For Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleon—that most<br>insignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in exile, showed<br>human dignity—Napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm; he<br>is grand. But Kutúzov—the man who from the beginning to the end of his<br>activity in 1812, never once swerving by word or deed from Borodinó to<br>Vílna, presented an example exceptional in history of self-sacrifice<br>and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was<br>happening—Kutúzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful, and<br>when speaking of him and of the year 1812 they always seem a little<br>ashamed.<br><br>And yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose<br>activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be<br>difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the<br>will of the whole people. Still more difficult would it be to find<br>an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so<br>completely accomplished as that to which all Kutúzov’s efforts were<br>directed in 1812.<br><br>Kutúzov never talked of “forty centuries looking down from the<br>Pyramids,” of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of<br>what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished; in general he<br>said nothing about himself, adopted no pose, always appeared to be<br>the simplest and most ordinary of men, and said the simplest and most<br>ordinary things. He wrote letters to his daughters and to Madame de<br>Staël, read novels, liked the society of pretty women, jested with<br>generals, officers, and soldiers, and never contradicted those who tried<br>to prove anything to him. When Count Rostopchín at the Yaúza bridge<br>galloped up to Kutúzov with personal reproaches for having caused the<br>destruction of Moscow, and said: “How was it you promised not to abandon<br>Moscow without a battle?” Kutúzov replied: “And I shall not abandon<br>Moscow without a battle,” though Moscow was then already abandoned. When<br>Arakchéev, coming to him from the Emperor, said that Ermólov ought to<br>be appointed chief of the artillery, Kutúzov replied: “Yes, I was<br>just saying so myself,” though a moment before he had said quite the<br>contrary. What did it matter to him—who then alone amid a senseless<br>crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was<br>happening—what did it matter to him whether Rostopchín attributed the<br>calamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could it matter to<br>him who was appointed chief of the artillery.<br><br>Not merely in these cases but continually did that old man—who by<br>experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the<br>words serving as their expression are not what move people—use quite<br>meaningless words that happened to enter his head.<br><br>But that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the whole<br>time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim<br>toward which he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite of<br>himself, in very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his real<br>thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood.<br>Beginning with the battle of Borodinó, from which time his disagreement<br>with those about him began, he alone said that the battle of Borodinó<br>was a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches<br>and reports up to the time of his death. He alone said that the loss of<br>Moscow is not the loss of Russia. In reply to Lauriston’s proposal of<br>peace, he said: There can be no peace, for such is the people’s will. He<br>alone during the retreat of the French said that all our maneuvers are<br>useless, everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could<br>desire; that the enemy must be offered “a golden bridge”; that neither<br>the Tarútino, the Vyázma, nor the Krásnoe battles were necessary; that<br>we must keep some force to reach the frontier with, and that he would<br>not sacrifice a single Russian for ten Frenchmen.<br><br>And this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to Arakchéev<br>to please the Emperor, he alone—incurring thereby the Emperor’s<br>displeasure—said in Vílna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is<br>useless and harmful.<br><br>Nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the<br>events. His actions—without the smallest deviation—were all directed<br>to one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his strength for<br>conflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to drive them out<br>of Russia, minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people<br>and of our army.<br><br>This procrastinator Kutúzov, whose motto was “Patience and Time,”<br>this enemy of decisive action, gave battle at Borodinó, investing the<br>preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This Kutúzov who before<br>the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, he alone, in<br>contradiction to everyone else, declared till his death that Borodinó<br>was a victory, despite the assurance of generals that the battle was<br>lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after<br>winning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat<br>insisted that battles, which were useless then, should not be fought,<br>and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia<br>crossed.<br><br>It is easy now to understand the significance of these events—if only we<br>abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed<br>only in the heads of a dozen individuals—for the events and results now<br>lie before us.<br><br>But how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general opinion,<br>so truly discern the importance of the people’s view of the events that<br>in all his activity he was never once untrue to it?<br><br>The source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the<br>events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in<br>full purity and strength.<br><br>Only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused<br>the people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar’s wish, to<br>select him—an old man in disfavor—to be their representative in the<br>national war. And only that feeling placed him on that highest human<br>pedestal from which he, the commander in chief, devoted all his powers<br>not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on<br>them.<br><br>That simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could not be<br>cast in the false mold of a European hero—the supposed ruler of men—that<br>history has invented.<br><br>To a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own conception of<br>greatness.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>The fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle of<br>Krásnoe. Toward evening—after much disputing and many mistakes made by<br>generals who did not go to their proper places, and after adjutants had<br>been sent about with counterorders—when it had become plain that the<br>enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no<br>battle, Kutúzov left Krásnoe and went to Dóbroe whither his headquarters<br>had that day been transferred.<br><br>The day was clear and frosty. Kutúzov rode to Dóbroe on his plump little<br>white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who<br>whispered among themselves behind his back. All along the road groups of<br>French prisoners captured that day (there were seven thousand of them)<br>were crowding to warm themselves at campfires. Near Dóbroe an immense<br>crowd of tattered prisoners, buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged<br>in anything they had been able to get hold of, were standing in the road<br>beside a long row of unharnessed French guns. At the approach of the<br>commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on<br>Kutúzov who, wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat<br>that bulged on his round shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his<br>white horse. One of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and<br>prisoners had been captured.<br><br>Kutúzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was<br>saying. He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed<br>attentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who presented a specially<br>wretched appearance. Most of them were disfigured by frost-bitten noses<br>and cheeks, and nearly all had red, swollen and festering eyes.<br><br>One group of the French stood close to the road, and two of them, one of<br>whom had his face covered with sores, were tearing a piece of raw<br>flesh with their hands. There was something horrible and bestial in<br>the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent<br>expression with which, after a glance at Kutúzov, the soldier with the<br>sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing.<br><br>Kutúzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers. He puckered his<br>face, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head. At another<br>spot he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a Frenchman on the<br>shoulder, saying something to him in a friendly manner, and Kutúzov with<br>the same expression on his face again swayed his head.<br><br>“What were you saying?” he asked the general, who continuing his report<br>directed the commander in chief’s attention to some standards captured<br>from the French and standing in front of the Preobrazhénsk regiment.<br><br>“Ah, the standards!” said Kutúzov, evidently detaching himself with<br>difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.<br><br>He looked about him absently. Thousands of eyes were looking at him from<br>all sides awaiting a word from him.<br><br>He stopped in front of the Preobrazhénsk regiment, sighed deeply, and<br>closed his eyes. One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying<br>the standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them.<br>Kutúzov was silent for a few seconds and then, submitting with evident<br>reluctance to the duty imposed by his position, raised his head<br>and began to speak. A throng of officers surrounded him. He looked<br>attentively around at the circle of officers, recognizing several of<br>them.<br><br>“I thank you all!” he said, addressing the soldiers and then again the<br>officers. In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were<br>distinctly heard. “I thank you all for your hard and faithful service.<br>The victory is complete and Russia will not forget you! Honor to you<br>forever.”<br><br>He paused and looked around.<br><br>“Lower its head, lower it!” he said to a soldier who had accidentally<br>lowered the French eagle he was holding before the Preobrazhénsk<br>standards. “Lower, lower, that’s it. Hurrah lads!” he added, addressing<br>the men with a rapid movement of his chin.<br><br>“Hur-r-rah!” roared thousands of voices.<br><br>While the soldiers were shouting Kutúzov leaned forward in his saddle<br>and bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic<br>gleam.<br><br>“You see, brothers...” said he when the shouts had ceased... and all at<br>once his voice and the expression of his face changed. It was no longer<br>the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to<br>tell his comrades something very important.<br><br>There was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the<br>soldiers, who moved that they might hear better what he was going to<br>say.<br><br>“You see, brothers, I know it’s hard for you, but it can’t be helped!<br>Bear up; it won’t be for long now! We’ll see our visitors off and then<br>we’ll rest. The Tsar won’t forget your service. It is hard for you, but<br>still you are at home while they—you see what they have come to,” said<br>he, pointing to the prisoners. “Worse off than our poorest beggars.<br>While they were strong we didn’t spare ourselves, but now we may even<br>pity them. They are human beings too. Isn’t it so, lads?”<br><br>He looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering gaze fixed<br>upon him he read sympathy with what he had said. His face grew brighter<br>and brighter with an old man’s mild smile, which drew the corners of his<br>lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased speaking and bowed<br>his head as if in perplexity.<br><br>“But after all who asked them here? Serves them right, the bloody<br>bastards!” he cried, suddenly lifting his head.<br><br>And flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time<br>during the whole campaign, and left the broken ranks of the soldiers<br>laughing joyfully and shouting “Hurrah!”<br><br>Kutúzov’s words were hardly understood by the troops. No one could have<br>repeated the field marshal’s address, begun solemnly and then changing<br>into an old man’s simplehearted talk; but the hearty sincerity of that<br>speech, the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe<br>and consciousness of the justice of our cause, exactly expressed by that<br>old man’s good-natured expletives, was not merely understood but lay<br>in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and<br>long-sustained shouts. Afterwards when one of the generals addressed<br>Kutúzov asking whether he wished his calèche to be sent for, Kutúzov in<br>answering unexpectedly gave a sob, being evidently greatly moved.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>When the troops reached their night’s halting place on the eighth of<br>November, the last day of the Krásnoe battles, it was already growing<br>dusk. All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly<br>falling snow and toward evening it began to clear. Through the falling<br>snow a purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew<br>keener.<br><br>An infantry regiment which had left Tarútino three thousand strong but<br>now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night<br>at its halting place—a village on the highroad. The quartermasters who<br>met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead<br>Frenchmen, cavalrymen, and members of the staff. There was only one hut<br>available for the regimental commander.<br><br>The commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through the<br>village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts.<br><br>Like some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare its<br>lair and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep<br>through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village, and<br>immediately the sound of axes and swords, the crashing of branches,<br>and merry voices could be heard from there. Another section amid the<br>regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy<br>getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and feeding the horses. A third<br>section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff<br>officers, carrying out the French corpses that were in the huts, and<br>dragging away boards, dry wood, and thatch from the roofs, for the<br>campfires, or wattle fences to serve for shelter.<br><br>Some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle<br>wall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.<br><br>“Now then, all together—shove!” cried the voices, and the huge surface<br>of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost, was seen<br>swaying in the gloom of the night. The lower stakes cracked more and<br>more and at last the wall fell, and with it the men who had been pushing<br>it. Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.<br><br>“Now then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! That’s it.... Where<br>are you shoving to?”<br><br>“Now, all together! But wait a moment, boys... With a song!”<br><br>All stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety voice began to sing. At<br>the end of the third verse as the last note died away, twenty voices<br>roared out at once: “Oo-oo-oo-oo! That’s it. All together! Heave away,<br>boys!...” but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved, and<br>in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible.<br><br>“Here, you of the Sixth Company! Devils that you are! Lend a hand...<br>will you? You may want us one of these days.”<br><br>Some twenty men of the Sixth Company who were on their way into the<br>village joined the haulers, and the wattle wall, which was about<br>thirty-five feet long and seven feet high, moved forward along the<br>village street, swaying, pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the<br>gasping men.<br><br>“Get along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There now....”<br><br>Merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.<br><br>“What are you up to?” suddenly came the authoritative voice of a<br>sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden.<br>“There are gentry here; the general himself is in that hut, and you<br>foul-mouthed devils, you brutes, I’ll give it to you!” shouted he,<br>hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back.<br>“Can’t you make less noise?”<br><br>The men became silent. The soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped<br>his face, which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against<br>the wattle.<br><br>“There, how that devil hits out! He’s made my face all bloody,” said he<br>in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on.<br><br>“Don’t you like it?” said a laughing voice, and moderating their tones<br>the men moved forward.<br><br>When they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as<br>before, interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives.<br><br>In the hut which the men had passed, the chief officers had gathered and<br>were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the<br>maneuvers suggested for tomorrow. It was proposed to make a flank march<br>to the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) and capture him.<br><br>By the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place<br>the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking, the wood<br>crackled, the snow was melting, and black shadows of soldiers flitted<br>to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden<br>down.<br><br>Axes and choppers were plied all around. Everything was done without any<br>orders being given. Stores of wood were brought for the night, shelters<br>were rigged up for the officers, caldrons were being boiled, and muskets<br>and accouterments put in order.<br><br>The wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the<br>Eighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up by musket rests,<br>and a campfire was built before it. They beat the tattoo, called the<br>roll, had supper, and settled down round the fires for the night—some<br>repairing their footgear, some smoking pipes, and some stripping<br>themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>One would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched<br>conditions the Russian soldiers were in at that time—lacking warm boots<br>and sheepskin coats, without a roof over their heads, in the snow<br>with eighteen degrees of frost, and without even full rations (the<br>commissariat did not always keep up with the troops)—they would have<br>presented a very sad and depressing spectacle.<br><br>On the contrary, the army had never under the best material conditions<br>presented a more cheerful and animated aspect. This was because all who<br>began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army<br>day by day. All the physically or morally weak had long since been left<br>behind and only the flower of the army—physically and mentally—remained.<br><br>More men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company than<br>anywhere else. Two sergeants major were sitting with them and their<br>campfire blazed brighter than others. For leave to sit by their wattle<br>they demanded contributions of fuel.<br><br>“Eh, Makéev! What has become of you, you son of a bitch? Are you lost or<br>have the wolves eaten you? Fetch some more wood!” shouted a red-haired<br>and red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the<br>smoke but not moving back from the fire. “And you, Jackdaw, go and fetch<br>some wood!” said he to another soldier.<br><br>This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being<br>robust he ordered about those weaker than himself. The soldier<br>they called “Jackdaw,” a thin little fellow with a sharp nose, rose<br>obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into<br>the light of the fire the slender, handsome figure of a young soldier<br>carrying a load of wood.<br><br>“Bring it here—that’s fine!”<br><br>They split up the wood, pressed it down on the fire, blew at it with<br>their mouths, and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats, making<br>the flames hiss and crackle. The men drew nearer and lit their pipes.<br>The handsome young soldier who had brought the wood, setting his arms<br>akimbo, began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot<br>where he stood.<br><br>“Mother! The dew is cold but clear.... It’s well that I’m a<br>musketeer...” he sang, pretending to hiccough after each syllable.<br><br>“Look out, your soles will fly off!” shouted the red-haired man,<br>noticing that the sole of the dancer’s boot was hanging loose. “What a<br>fellow you are for dancing!”<br><br>The dancer stopped, pulled off the loose piece of leather, and threw it<br>on the fire.<br><br>“Right enough, friend,” said he, and, having sat down, took out of his<br>knapsack a scrap of blue French cloth, and wrapped it round his foot.<br>“It’s the steam that spoils them,” he added, stretching out his feet<br>toward the fire.<br><br>“They’ll soon be issuing us new ones. They say that when we’ve finished<br>hammering them, we’re to receive double kits!”<br><br>“And that son of a bitch Petróv has lagged behind after all, it seems,”<br>said one sergeant major.<br><br>“I’ve had an eye on him this long while,” said the other.<br><br>“Well, he’s a poor sort of soldier....”<br><br>“But in the Third Company they say nine men were missing yesterday.”<br><br>“Yes, it’s all very well, but when a man’s feet are frozen how can he<br>walk?”<br><br>“Eh? Don’t talk nonsense!” said a sergeant major.<br><br>“Do you want to be doing the same?” said an old soldier, turning<br>reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet.<br><br>“Well, you know,” said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in a<br>squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the<br>fire, “a plump man gets thin, but for a thin one it’s death. Take<br>me, now! I’ve got no strength left,” he added, with sudden resolution<br>turning to the sergeant major. “Tell them to send me to hospital; I’m<br>aching all over; anyway I shan’t be able to keep up.”<br><br>“That’ll do, that’ll do!” replied the sergeant major quietly.<br><br>The soldier said no more and the talk went on.<br><br>“What a lot of those Frenchies were taken today, and the fact is that<br>not one of them had what you might call real boots on,” said a soldier,<br>starting a new theme. “They were no more than make-believes.”<br><br>“The Cossacks have taken their boots. They were clearing the hut for the<br>colonel and carried them out. It was pitiful to see them, boys,” put in<br>the dancer. “As they turned them over one seemed still alive and, would<br>you believe it, he jabbered something in their lingo.”<br><br>“But they’re a clean folk, lads,” the first man went on; “he was<br>white—as white as birchbark—and some of them are such fine fellows, you<br>might think they were nobles.”<br><br>“Well, what do you think? They make soldiers of all classes there.”<br><br>“But they don’t understand our talk at all,” said the dancer with a<br>puzzled smile. “I asked him whose subject he was, and he jabbered in his<br>own way. A queer lot!”<br><br>“But it’s strange, friends,” continued the man who had wondered at their<br>whiteness, “the peasants at Mozháysk were saying that when they began<br>burying the dead—where the battle was you know—well, those dead had been<br>lying there for nearly a month, and says the peasant, ‘they lie as white<br>as paper, clean, and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke.’”<br><br>“Was it from the cold?” asked someone.<br><br>“You’re a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot. If it<br>had been from the cold, ours would not have rotted either. ‘But,’ he<br>says, ‘go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty. So,’ he says,<br>‘we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag<br>them off: we can hardly do it. But theirs,’ he says, ‘are white as paper<br>and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder.’”<br><br>All were silent.<br><br>“It must be from their food,” said the sergeant major. “They used to<br>gobble the same food as the gentry.”<br><br>No one contradicted him.<br><br>“That peasant near Mozháysk where the battle was said the men were all<br>called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and<br>still didn’t finish carting the dead away. And as for the wolves, he<br>says...”<br><br>“That was a real battle,” said an old soldier. “It’s the only one worth<br>remembering; but since that... it’s only been tormenting folk.”<br><br>“And do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them and,<br>my word, they didn’t let us get near before they just threw down their<br>muskets and went on their knees. ‘Pardon!’ they say. That’s only one<br>case. They say Plátov took ‘Poleon himself twice. But he didn’t know<br>the right charm. He catches him and catches him—no good! He turns into<br>a bird in his hands and flies away. And there’s no way of killing him<br>either.”<br><br>“You’re a first-class liar, Kiselëv, when I come to look at you!”<br><br>“Liar, indeed! It’s the real truth.”<br><br>“If he fell into my hands, when I’d caught him I’d bury him in the<br>ground with an aspen stake to fix him down. What a lot of men he’s<br>ruined!”<br><br>“Well, anyhow we’re going to end it. He won’t come here again,” remarked<br>the old soldier, yawning.<br><br>The conversation flagged, and the soldiers began settling down to sleep.<br><br>“Look at the stars. It’s wonderful how they shine! You would think the<br>women had spread out their linen,” said one of the men, gazing with<br>admiration at the Milky Way.<br><br>“That’s a sign of a good harvest next year.”<br><br>“We shall want some more wood.”<br><br>“You warm your back and your belly gets frozen. That’s queer.”<br><br>“O Lord!”<br><br>“What are you pushing for? Is the fire only for you? Look how he’s<br>sprawling!”<br><br>In the silence that ensued, the snoring of those who had fallen asleep<br>could be heard. Others turned over and warmed themselves, now and again<br>exchanging a few words. From a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound<br>of general, merry laughter.<br><br>“Hark at them roaring there in the Fifth Company!” said one of the<br>soldiers, “and what a lot of them there are!”<br><br>One of the men got up and went over to the Fifth Company.<br><br>“They’re having such fun,” said he, coming back. “Two Frenchies have<br>turned up. One’s quite frozen and the other’s an awful swaggerer. He’s<br>singing songs....”<br><br>“Oh, I’ll go across and have a look....”<br><br>And several of the men went over to the Fifth Company.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>The fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest. A huge<br>campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow, lighting up the<br>branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost.<br><br>About midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest,<br>and the crackling of dry branches.<br><br>“A bear, lads,” said one of the men.<br><br>They all raised their heads to listen, and out of the forest into the<br>bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to<br>one another.<br><br>These were two Frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest. They came up<br>to the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did<br>not understand. One was taller than the other; he wore an officer’s hat<br>and seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the fire he had been going to<br>sit down, but fell. The other, a short sturdy soldier with a shawl<br>tied round his head, was stronger. He raised his companion and said<br>something, pointing to his mouth. The soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen,<br>spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man, and brought some<br>buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them.<br><br>The exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his head<br>wrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.<br><br>When Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he<br>suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the<br>soldiers, who could not understand him. Ramballe refused food and<br>resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire, looking at<br>the Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes. Occasionally he emitted<br>a long-drawn groan and then again became silent. Morel, pointing to his<br>shoulders, tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that Ramballe was<br>an officer and ought to be warmed. A Russian officer who had come up<br>to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a French<br>officer into his hut to warm him, and when the messenger returned and<br>said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him, Ramballe<br>was told to go. He rose and tried to walk, but staggered and would have<br>fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up.<br><br>“You won’t do it again, eh?” said one of the soldiers, winking and<br>turning mockingly to Ramballe.<br><br>“Oh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you are—a real peasant!” came<br>rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier.<br><br>They surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on the crossed arms of two<br>soldiers, and carried him to the hut. Ramballe put his arms around their<br>necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively:<br><br>“Oh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! These are men! Oh, my<br>brave, kind friends,” and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one<br>of the men like a child.<br><br>Meanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire, surrounded by<br>the soldiers.<br><br>Morel, a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes, was<br>wearing a woman’s cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his<br>head over his cap. He was evidently tipsy, and was singing a French song<br>in a hoarse broken voice, with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier.<br>The soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him.<br><br>“Now then, now then, teach us how it goes! I’ll soon pick it up. How is<br>it?” said the man—a singer and a wag—whom Morel was embracing.<br><br>“Vive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi valiant!” sang Morel, winking. “Ce<br>diable à quatre...” *<br><br>     * “Long live Henry the Fourth, that valiant king! That rowdy<br>     devil.”<br><br><br>“Vivarika! Vif-seruvaru! Sedyablyaka!” repeated the soldier, flourishing<br>his arm and really catching the tune.<br><br>“Bravo! Ha, ha, ha!” rose their rough, joyous laughter from all sides.<br><br>Morel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too.<br><br>“Well, go on, go on!”<br><br>    “Qui eut le triple talent,<br>    De boire, de battre,<br>    Et d’être un vert galant.” *<br><br>      * Who had a triple talent<br>      For drinking, for fighting,<br>      And for being a gallant old boy...<br><br>“It goes smoothly, too. Well, now, Zaletáev!”<br><br>“Ke...” Zaletáev, brought out with effort: “ke-e-e-e,” he drawled,<br>laboriously pursing his lips, “le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, e<br>de-tra-va-ga-la” he sang.<br><br>“Fine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want some more to eat?”<br><br>“Give him some porridge: it takes a long time to get filled up after<br>starving.”<br><br>They gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to work on<br>his third bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him.<br>The older men, who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such<br>nonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire, but one<br>would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at Morel with a<br>smile.<br><br>“They are men too,” said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his<br>coat. “Even wormwood grows on its own root.”<br><br>“O Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tremendous! That means a hard<br>frost....”<br><br>They all grew silent. The stars, as if knowing that no one was looking<br>at them, began to disport themselves in the dark sky: now flaring<br>up, now vanishing, now trembling, they were busy whispering something<br>gladsome and mysterious to one another.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>The French army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical<br>progression; and that crossing of the Berëzina about which so much has<br>been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction, and<br>not at all the decisive episode of the campaign. If so much has been<br>and still is written about the Berëzina, on the French side this is only<br>because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army<br>had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment<br>into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory, and on the<br>Russian side merely because in Petersburg—far from the seat of war—a<br>plan (again one of Pfuel’s) had been devised to catch Napoleon in a<br>strategic trap at the Berëzina River. Everyone assured himself that all<br>would happen according to plan, and therefore insisted that it was just<br>the crossing of the Berëzina that destroyed the French army. In reality<br>the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the French—in<br>guns and men lost—than Krásnoe had been, as the figures show.<br><br>The sole importance of the crossing of the Berëzina lies in the fact<br>that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for<br>cutting off the enemy’s retreat and the soundness of the only possible<br>line of action—the one Kutúzov and the general mass of the army<br>demanded—namely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd fled<br>at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to<br>reaching its goal. It fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible<br>to block its path. This was shown not so much by the arrangements it<br>made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges. When the bridges<br>broke down, unarmed soldiers, people from Moscow and women with<br>children who were with the French transport, all—carried on by vis<br>inertiæ—pressed forward into boats and into the ice-covered water and<br>did not surrender.<br><br>That impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitives and of pursuers<br>was equally bad. As long as they remained with their own people each<br>might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held<br>among them. But those who surrendered, while remaining in the same<br>pitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share in the<br>necessities of life. The French did not need to be informed of the fact<br>that half the prisoners—with whom the Russians did not know what to<br>do—perished of cold and hunger despite their captors’ desire to save<br>them; they felt that it could not be otherwise. The most compassionate<br>Russian commanders, those favorable to the French—and even the Frenchmen<br>in the Russian service—could do nothing for the prisoners. The French<br>perished from the conditions to which the Russian army was itself<br>exposed. It was impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and<br>indispensable soldiers to give to the French who, though not harmful, or<br>hated, or guilty, were simply unnecessary. Some Russians even did that,<br>but they were exceptions.<br><br>Certain destruction lay behind the French but in front there was hope.<br>Their ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in collective<br>flight, and on that the whole strength of the French was concentrated.<br><br>The farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the<br>remnant, especially after the Berëzina, on which (in consequence of the<br>Petersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians, and<br>the keener grew the passions of the Russian commanders, who blamed one<br>another and Kutúzov most of all. Anticipation that the failure of<br>the Petersburg Berëzina plan would be attributed to Kutúzov led<br>to dissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more strongly<br>expressed. The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a<br>respectful form, making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was<br>to blame. They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him or<br>asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable<br>formality, but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at<br>every turn.<br><br>Because they could not understand him all these people assumed that<br>it was useless to talk to the old man; that he would never grasp the<br>profundity of their plans, that he would answer with his phrases (which<br>they thought were mere phrases) about a “golden bridge,” about the<br>impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions,<br>and so forth. They had heard all that before. And all he said—that it<br>was necessary to await provisions, or that the men had no boots—was so<br>simple, while what they proposed was so complicated and clever, that<br>it was evident that he was old and stupid and that they, though not in<br>power, were commanders of genius.<br><br>After the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and Petersburg<br>hero Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their<br>maximum. Kutúzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders.<br>Only once, after the affair of the Berëzina, did he get angry and write<br>to Bennigsen (who reported separately to the Emperor) the following<br>letter:<br><br>“On account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency please<br>be so good as to set off for Kalúga on receipt of this, and there await<br>further commands and appointments from His Imperial Majesty.”<br><br>But after Bennigsen’s departure, the Grand Duke Tsarévich Constantine<br>Pávlovich joined the army. He had taken part in the beginning of the<br>campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by Kutúzov.<br>Now having come to the army, he informed Kutúzov of the Emperor’s<br>displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their<br>advance. The Emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days’<br>time.<br><br>The old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairs—this<br>same Kutúzov who in August had been chosen commander in chief<br>against the sovereign’s wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke and<br>heir-apparent from the army—who on his own authority and contrary to the<br>Emperor’s will had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, now realized at<br>once that his day was over, that his part was played, and that the power<br>he was supposed to hold was no longer his. And he understood this not<br>merely from the attitude of the court. He saw on the one hand that the<br>military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt<br>that his mission was accomplished; and at the same time he began to<br>be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the<br>necessity of physical rest.<br><br>On the twenty-ninth of November Kutúzov entered Vílna—his “dear Vílna”<br>as he called it. Twice during his career Kutúzov had been governor of<br>Vílna. In that wealthy town, which had not been injured, he found old<br>friends and associations, besides the comforts of life of which he had<br>so long been deprived. And he suddenly turned from the cares of army<br>and state and, as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed,<br>immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been<br>accustomed, as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be<br>done in the realm of history did not concern him at all.<br><br>Chichagóv, one of the most zealous “cutters-off” and “breakers-up,” who<br>had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but<br>never wished to go where he was sent: Chichagóv, noted for the boldness<br>with which he spoke to the Emperor, and who considered Kutúzov to be<br>under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace<br>with Turkey in 1811 independently of Kutúzov, and found that peace had<br>already been concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of<br>securing that peace was really Kutúzov’s; this Chichagóv was the first<br>to meet Kutúzov at the castle where the latter was to stay. In undress<br>naval uniform, with a dirk, and holding his cap under his arm, he handed<br>Kutúzov a garrison report and the keys of the town. The contemptuously<br>respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was<br>expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of Chichagóv, who knew<br>of the accusations that were being directed against Kutúzov.<br><br>When speaking to Chichagóv, Kutúzov incidentally mentioned that the<br>vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at Borísov<br>had been recovered and would be restored to him.<br><br>“You mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the<br>contrary, I can supply you with everything even if you want to give<br>dinner parties,” warmly replied Chichagóv, who tried by every word he<br>spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined Kutúzov to be<br>animated by the same desire.<br><br>Kutúzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle penetrating<br>smile: “I meant merely to say what I said.”<br><br>Contrary to the Emperor’s wish Kutúzov detained the greater part of the<br>army at Vílna. Those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack<br>and physically feeble during his stay in that town. He attended to army<br>affairs reluctantly, left everything to his generals, and while awaiting<br>the Emperor’s arrival led a dissipated life.<br><br>Having left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his suite—Count<br>Tolstóy, Prince Volkónski, Arakchéev, and others—the Emperor reached<br>Vílna on the eleventh, and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to<br>the castle. In spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff<br>officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle, as well as<br>a guard of honor of the Semënov regiment.<br><br>A courier who galloped to the castle in advance, in a troyka with three<br>foam-flecked horses, shouted “Coming!” and Konovnítsyn rushed into the<br>vestibule to inform Kutúzov, who was waiting in the hall porter’s little<br>lodge.<br><br>A minute later the old man’s large stout figure in full-dress uniform,<br>his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach,<br>waddled out into the porch. He put on his hat with its peaks to the<br>sides and, holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort<br>sideways down the steps to the level of the street, took in his hand the<br>report he had prepared for the Emperor.<br><br>There was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew<br>furiously up, and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh<br>in which the figures of the Emperor and Volkónski could already be<br>descried.<br><br>From the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect<br>on the old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself all over,<br>readjusted his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up and,<br>at the very moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the sleigh,<br>lifted his eyes to him, handed him the report and began speaking in his<br>smooth, ingratiating voice.<br><br>The Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kutúzov from head to foot,<br>frowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to the<br>old man, extended his arms and embraced him. And this embrace too, owing<br>to a long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings, had its<br>usual effect on Kutúzov and he gave a sob.<br><br>The Emperor greeted the officers and the Semënov guard, and again<br>pressing the old man’s hand went with him into the castle.<br><br>When alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his<br>dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made<br>at Krásnoe and the Berëzina, and informed him of his intentions for a<br>future campaign abroad. Kutúzov made no rejoinder or remark. The same<br>submissive, expressionless look with which he had listened to the<br>Emperor’s commands on the field of Austerlitz seven years before settled<br>on his face now.<br><br>When Kutúzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing<br>the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by someone’s<br>voice saying:<br><br>“Your Serene Highness!”<br><br>Kutúzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of<br>Count Tolstóy, who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay<br>a small object. Kutúzov seemed not to understand what was expected of<br>him.<br><br>Suddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed<br>across his puffy face, and bowing low and respectfully he took the<br>object that lay on the salver. It was the Order of St. George of the<br>First Class.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>Next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the Emperor<br>honored by his presence. Kutúzov had received the Order of St. George<br>of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest honors, but<br>everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him. The proprieties<br>were observed and the Emperor was the first to set that example,<br>but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and<br>good-for-nothing. When Kutúzov, conforming to a custom of Catherine’s<br>day, ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the<br>Emperor’s feet on his entering the ballroom, the Emperor made a wry face<br>and muttered something in which some people caught the words, “the old<br>comedian.”<br><br>The Emperor’s displeasure with Kutúzov was specially increased at Vílna<br>by the fact that Kutúzov evidently could not or would not understand the<br>importance of the coming campaign.<br><br>When on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers assembled<br>about him: “You have not only saved Russia, you have saved Europe!” they<br>all understood that the war was not ended.<br><br>Kutúzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that<br>no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of Russia,<br>but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had<br>gained. He tried to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying<br>fresh troops, spoke of the hardships already endured by the people, of<br>the possibility of failure and so forth.<br><br>This being the field marshal’s frame of mind he was naturally regarded<br>as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.<br><br>To avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natural method was<br>to do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with Barclay at<br>the beginning of the Russian campaign—to transfer the authority to the<br>Emperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under the commander in<br>chief’s feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the<br>change.<br><br>With this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real<br>strength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll, Konovnítsyn, and<br>Ermólov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke loudly of the field<br>marshal’s great weakness and failing health.<br><br>His health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to<br>another. And in fact his health was poor.<br><br>So naturally, simply, and gradually—just as he had come from Turkey to<br>the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia, and then to the army<br>when he was needed there—now when his part was played out, Kutúzov’s<br>place was taken by a new and necessary performer.<br><br>The war of 1812, besides its national significance dear to every Russian<br>heart, was now to assume another, a European, significance.<br><br>The movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a<br>movement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war another<br>leader was necessary, having qualities and views differing from<br>Kutúzov’s and animated by different motives.<br><br>Alexander I was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east<br>to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as Kutúzov had been<br>for the salvation and glory of Russia.<br><br>Kutúzov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, or<br>Napoleon meant. He could not understand it. For the representative of<br>the Russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia had<br>been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, there was nothing<br>left to do as a Russian. Nothing remained for the representative of the<br>national war but to die, and Kutúzov died.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>As generally happens, Pierre did not feel the full effects of the<br>physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after<br>they were over. After his liberation he reached Orël, and on the third<br>day there, when preparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid up<br>for three months. He had what the doctors termed “bilious fever.” But<br>despite the fact that the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him<br>medicines to drink, he recovered.<br><br>Scarcely any impression was left on Pierre’s mind by all that happened<br>to him from the time of his rescue till his illness. He remembered<br>only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy, internal physical<br>distress, and pains in his feet and side. He remembered a general<br>impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being<br>worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him, he<br>also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses, and<br>above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time.<br>On the day of his rescue he had seen the body of Pétya Rostóv. That same<br>day he had learned that Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of<br>Borodinó for more than a month had recently died in the Rostóvs’ house<br>at Yaroslávl, and Denísov who told him this news also mentioned Hélène’s<br>death, supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All this at<br>the time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its<br>significance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as<br>possible from places where people were killing one another, to some<br>peaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think over<br>all the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Orël he<br>immediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw<br>in attendance on him two of his servants, Terénty and Váska, who had<br>come from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had been<br>living on his estate at Eléts and hearing of his rescue and illness had<br>come to look after him.<br><br>It was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost the<br>impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months<br>and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere<br>tomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he<br>would be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for a long time in<br>his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity. In the<br>same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been<br>told after his rescue, about the death of Prince Andrew, the death of<br>his wife, and the destruction of the French.<br><br>A joyous feeling of freedom—that complete inalienable freedom natural<br>to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside<br>Moscow—filled Pierre’s soul during his convalescence. He was surprised<br>to find that this inner freedom, which was independent of external<br>conditions, now had as it were an additional setting of external<br>liberty. He was alone in a strange town, without acquaintances. No one<br>demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere. He had all he wanted:<br>the thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no<br>longer there, since she was no more.<br><br>“Oh, how good! How splendid!” said he to himself when a cleanly laid<br>table was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay down for<br>the night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the French had<br>gone and that his wife was no more. “Oh, how good, how splendid!”<br><br>And by old habit he asked himself the question: “Well, and what then?<br>What am I going to do?” And he immediately gave himself the answer:<br>“Well, I shall live. Ah, how splendid!”<br><br>The very question that had formerly tormented him, the thing he had<br>continually sought to find—the aim of life—no longer existed for<br>him now. That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared<br>temporarily—he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not<br>present itself again. And this very absence of an aim gave him the<br>complete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at<br>this time.<br><br>He could not see an aim, for he now had faith—not faith in any kind of<br>rule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living, ever-manifest<br>God. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself. That search for<br>an aim had been simply a search for God, and suddenly in his captivity<br>he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his<br>nurse had told him long ago: that God is here and everywhere. In his<br>captivity he had learned that in Karatáev God was greater, more infinite<br>and unfathomable than in the Architect of the Universe recognized by the<br>Freemasons. He felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into<br>the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet. All his life<br>he had looked over the heads of the men around him, when he should have<br>merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes.<br><br>In the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable<br>infinite something. He had only felt that it must exist somewhere and<br>had looked for it. In everything near and comprehensible he had seen<br>only what was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseless. He had<br>equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space,<br>where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to<br>him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen. And such<br>had European life, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and philanthropy<br>seemed to him. But even then, at moments of weakness as he had accounted<br>them, his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen<br>the same pettiness, worldliness, and senselessness. Now, however, he<br>had learned to see the great, eternal, and infinite in everything, and<br>therefore—to see it and enjoy its contemplation—he naturally threw away<br>the telescope through which he had till now gazed over men’s heads, and<br>gladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and<br>infinite life around him. And the closer he looked the more tranquil and<br>happy he became. That dreadful question, “What for?” which had formerly<br>destroyed all his mental edifices, no longer existed for him. To that<br>question, “What for?” a simple answer was now always ready in his soul:<br>“Because there is a God, that God without whose will not one hair falls<br>from a man’s head.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>In external ways Pierre had hardly changed at all. In appearance he<br>was just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded and seemed<br>occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special<br>of his own. The difference between his former and present self was that<br>formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to<br>him, he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to<br>distinguish something at a distance. At present he still forgot what was<br>said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes, but he now<br>looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what<br>was before him and listened to what was said, though evidently seeing<br>and hearing something quite different. Formerly he had appeared to be<br>a kindhearted but unhappy man, and so people had been inclined to avoid<br>him. Now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips, and<br>sympathy for others shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to<br>whether they were as contented as he was, and people felt pleased by his<br>presence.<br><br>Previously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he talked, and<br>seldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in conversation and<br>knew how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate<br>secrets.<br><br>The princess, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly<br>hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after<br>the old count’s death, now after staying a short time in Orël—where she<br>had come intending to show Pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she<br>considered it her duty to nurse him—felt to her surprise and vexation<br>that she had become fond of him. Pierre did not in any way seek her<br>approval, he merely studied her with interest. Formerly she had felt<br>that he regarded her with indifference and irony, and so had shrunk into<br>herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side<br>of her nature; but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most<br>intimate places of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but afterwards<br>gratefully, she let him see the hidden, kindly sides of her character.<br><br>The most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more<br>successfully, evoking memories of the best times of her youth and<br>showing sympathy with them. Yet Pierre’s cunning consisted simply in<br>finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered,<br>hard, and (in her own way) proud princess.<br><br>“Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under the influence of<br>bad people but of people such as myself,” thought she.<br><br>His servants too—Terénty and Váska—in their own way noticed the change<br>that had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he had become much<br>“simpler.” Terénty, when he had helped him undress and wished him good<br>night, often lingered with his master’s boots in his hands and clothes<br>over his arm, to see whether he would not start a talk. And Pierre,<br>noticing that Terénty wanted a chat, generally kept him there.<br><br>“Well, tell me... now, how did you get food?” he would ask.<br><br>And Terénty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of<br>the old count, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and<br>talking, or sometimes listening to Pierre’s stories, and then would go<br>out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and<br>affection for him.<br><br>The doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, though he<br>considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment<br>was of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with Pierre<br>telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the<br>characters of his patients in general, and especially of the ladies.<br><br>“It’s a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not like our<br>provincials,” he would say.<br><br>There were several prisoners from the French army in Orël, and the<br>doctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre.<br><br>This officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make fun of<br>the tenderness the Italian expressed for him.<br><br>The Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk<br>with him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and his love,<br>and pour out to him his indignation against the French and especially<br>against Napoleon.<br><br>“If all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight<br>such a nation,” he said to Pierre. “You, who have suffered so from the<br>French, do not even feel animosity toward them.”<br><br>Pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely by<br>evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing.<br><br>During the last days of Pierre’s stay in Orël his old Masonic<br>acquaintance Count Willarski, who had introduced him to the lodge in<br>1807, came to see him. Willarski was married to a Russian heiress who<br>had a large estate in Orël province, and he occupied a temporary post in<br>the commissariat department in that town.<br><br>Hearing that Bezúkhov was in Orël, Willarski, though they had never been<br>intimate, came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy<br>that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another.<br>Willarski felt dull in Orël and was pleased to meet a man of his own<br>circle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.<br><br>But to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much<br>behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into<br>apathy and egotism.<br><br>“You are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,” he said.<br><br>But for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been<br>formerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every day. To Pierre as<br>he looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to think that<br>he had been like that himself but a short time before.<br><br>Willarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family affairs,<br>his wife’s affairs, and his official duties. He regarded all these<br>occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that they were all<br>contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his<br>family. Military, administrative, political, and Masonic interests<br>continually absorbed his attention. And Pierre, without trying to<br>change the other’s views and without condemning him, but with the quiet,<br>joyful, and amused smile now habitual to him, was interested in this<br>strange though very familiar phenomenon.<br><br>There was a new feature in Pierre’s relations with Willarski, with the<br>princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which<br>gained for him the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of<br>the impossibility of changing a man’s convictions by words, and his<br>recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing<br>things each from his own point of view. This legitimate peculiarity of<br>each individual which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a<br>basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the interest he took in, other<br>people. The difference, and sometimes complete contradiction, between<br>men’s opinions and their lives, and between one man and another, pleased<br>him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile.<br><br>In practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center<br>of gravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary questions,<br>especially requests for money to which, as an extremely wealthy man,<br>he was very exposed, produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and<br>perplexity. “To give or not to give?” he had asked himself. “I have<br>it and he needs it. But someone else needs it still more. Who needs it<br>most? And perhaps they are both impostors?” In the old days he had been<br>unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all<br>who asked as long as he had anything to give. Formerly he had been in a<br>similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his<br>property, when one person advised one thing and another something else.<br><br>Now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or<br>perplexity about these questions. There was now within him a judge who<br>by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done.<br><br>He was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but now he felt<br>certain of what ought and what ought not to be done. The first time he<br>had recourse to his new judge was when a French prisoner, a colonel,<br>came to him and, after talking a great deal about his exploits,<br>concluded by making what amounted to a demand that Pierre should give<br>him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children. Pierre<br>refused without the least difficulty or effort, and was afterwards<br>surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so<br>insurmountably difficult. At the same time that he refused the colonel’s<br>demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when<br>leaving Orël, to induce the Italian officer to accept some money of<br>which he was evidently in need. A further proof to Pierre of his own<br>more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision<br>with regard to his wife’s debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in<br>and near Moscow.<br><br>His head steward came to him at Orël and Pierre reckoned up with him his<br>diminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, according to the<br>head steward’s calculation, about two million rubles.<br><br>To console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate<br>showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but<br>would even be increased if he refused to pay his wife’s debts which he<br>was under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild his Moscow house<br>and the country house on his Moscow estate, which had cost him eighty<br>thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing.<br><br>“Yes, of course that’s true,” said Pierre with a cheerful smile. “I<br>don’t need all that at all. By being ruined I have become much richer.”<br><br>But in January Savélich came from Moscow and gave him an account of the<br>state of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect had made<br>of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses, speaking of this<br>as of a settled matter. About the same time he received letters from<br>Prince Vasíli and other Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife’s<br>debts. And Pierre decided that the steward’s proposals which had so<br>pleased him were wrong and that he must go to Petersburg and settle his<br>wife’s affairs and must rebuild in Moscow. Why this was necessary he<br>did not know, but he knew for certain that it was necessary. His income<br>would be reduced by three fourths, but he felt it must be done.<br><br>Willarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together.<br><br>During the whole time of his convalescence in Orël Pierre had<br>experienced a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when during his<br>journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new<br>faces, that feeling was intensified. Throughout his journey he felt like<br>a schoolboy on holiday. Everyone—the stagecoach driver, the post-house<br>overseers, the peasants on the roads and in the villages—had a new<br>significance for him. The presence and remarks of Willarski who<br>continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia and its<br>backwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierre’s pleasure.<br>Where Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary strength and<br>vitality—the strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained<br>the life of this original, peculiar, and unique people. He did not<br>contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with him—an apparent<br>agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to<br>nothing—and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>It would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap<br>has been destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits of<br>rubbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they<br>jostle, overtake one another, and fight, and it would be equally<br>difficult to explain what caused the Russians after the departure of the<br>French to throng to the place that had formerly been Moscow. But when<br>we watch the ants round their ruined heap, the tenacity, energy, and<br>immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction<br>of the heap, something indestructible, which though intangible is the<br>real strength of the colony, still exists; and similarly, though in<br>Moscow in the month of October there was no government and no churches,<br>shrines, riches, or houses—it was still the Moscow it had been in<br>August. All was destroyed, except something intangible yet powerful and<br>indestructible.<br><br>The motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after it had<br>been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and at first<br>for the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all had in<br>common: a desire to get to the place that had been called Moscow, to<br>apply their activities there.<br><br>Within a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in a<br>fortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 1813 the<br>number, ever increasing and increasing, exceeded what it had been in<br>1812.<br><br>The first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of Wintzingerode’s<br>detachment, peasants from the adjacent villages, and residents who had<br>fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity. The Russians who<br>entered Moscow, finding it plundered, plundered it in their turn. They<br>continued what the French had begun. Trains of peasant carts came to<br>Moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the<br>ruined houses and the streets. The Cossacks carried off what they could<br>to their camps, and the householders seized all they could find in other<br>houses and moved it to their own, pretending that it was their property.<br><br>But the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third<br>contingent, and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more<br>difficult and assumed more definite forms.<br><br>The French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of<br>regular life, with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship, with<br>luxury, and governmental and religious institutions. These forms were<br>lifeless but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, warehouses,<br>market stalls, granaries—for the most part still stocked with goods—and<br>there were factories and workshops, palaces and wealthy houses filled<br>with luxuries, hospitals, prisons, government offices, churches, and<br>cathedrals. The longer the French remained the more these forms of town<br>life perished, until finally all was merged into one confused, lifeless<br>scene of plunder.<br><br>The more the plundering by the French continued, the more both the<br>wealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed. But<br>plundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of the city<br>began, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the greater<br>the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth<br>of the city and its regular life restored.<br><br>Besides the plunderers, very various people, some drawn by curiosity,<br>some by official duties, some by self-interest—house owners, clergy,<br>officials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and peasants—streamed into<br>Moscow as blood flows to the heart.<br><br>Within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off<br>plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses<br>out of the town. Other peasants, having heard of their comrades’<br>discomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat down<br>one another’s prices to below what they had been in former days. Gangs<br>of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in Moscow every day, and on<br>all sides logs were being hewn, new houses built, and old, charred ones<br>repaired. Tradesmen began trading in booths. Cookshops and taverns were<br>opened in partially burned houses. The clergy resumed the services<br>in many churches that had not been burned. Donors contributed<br>Church property that had been stolen. Government clerks set up their<br>baize-covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms.<br>The higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of<br>goods left behind by the French. The owners of houses in which much<br>property had been left, brought there from other houses, complained of<br>the injustice of taking everything to the Faceted Palace in the Krémlin;<br>others insisted that as the French had gathered things from different<br>houses into this or that house, it would be unfair to allow its owner to<br>keep all that was found there. They abused the police and bribed them,<br>made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that<br>had perished in the fire, and demanded relief. And Count Rostopchín<br>wrote proclamations.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>At the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex of<br>his house which had not been burned. He called on Count Rostopchín and<br>on some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, and he intended to leave<br>for Petersburg two days later. Everybody was celebrating the victory,<br>everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city.<br>Everyone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished to meet him, and<br>everyone questioned him about what he had seen. Pierre felt particularly<br>well disposed toward them all, but was now instinctively on his<br>guard for fear of binding himself in any way. To all questions put to<br>him—whether important or quite trifling—such as: Where would he live?<br>Was he going to rebuild? When was he going to Petersburg and would he<br>mind taking a parcel for someone?—he replied: “Yes, perhaps,” or, “I<br>think so,” and so on.<br><br>He had heard that the Rostóvs were at Kostromá but the thought of<br>Natásha seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleasant<br>memory of the distant past. He felt himself not only free from social<br>obligations but also from that feeling which, it seemed to him, he had<br>aroused in himself.<br><br>On the third day after his arrival he heard from the Drubetskóys that<br>Princess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days of<br>Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre’s thoughts and now recurred to<br>him with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary<br>was in Moscow and living in her house—which had not been burned—in<br>Vozdvízhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her.<br><br>On his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of their<br>friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially of the last<br>one at Borodinó.<br><br>“Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in?<br>Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him<br>before he died?” thought Pierre. He recalled Karatáev and his death and<br>involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and yet so<br>similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he<br>felt for both of them.<br><br>Pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood.<br>The house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but its<br>general aspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with a<br>stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence<br>of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house,<br>informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments, and that<br>she received on Sundays.<br><br>“Announce me. Perhaps she will see me,” said Pierre.<br><br>“Yes, sir,” said the man. “Please step into the portrait gallery.”<br><br>A few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought<br>word from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he<br>would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.<br><br>In a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her<br>another person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess<br>always had lady companions, but who they were and what they were like<br>he never knew or remembered. “This must be one of her companions,” he<br>thought, glancing at the lady in the black dress.<br><br>The princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand.<br><br>“Yes,” she said, looking at his altered face after he had kissed her<br>hand, “so this is how we meet again. He spoke of you even at the very<br>last,” she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a<br>shyness that surprised him for an instant.<br><br>“I was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of good<br>news we had received for a long time.”<br><br>Again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more<br>uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre<br>interrupted her.<br><br>“Just imagine—I knew nothing about him!” said he. “I thought he had been<br>killed. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only know that<br>he fell in with the Rostóvs.... What a strange coincidence!”<br><br>Pierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at the<br>companion’s face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and,<br>as often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion<br>in the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would not<br>hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary.<br><br>But when he mentioned the Rostóvs, Princess Mary’s face expressed still<br>greater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierre’s face to<br>that of the lady in the black dress and said:<br><br>“Do you really not recognize her?”<br><br>Pierre looked again at the companion’s pale, delicate face with its<br>black eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long forgotten<br>and more than sweet, looked at him from those attentive eyes.<br><br>“But no, it can’t be!” he thought. “This stern, thin, pale face that<br>looks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her.”<br>But at that moment Princess Mary said, “Natásha!” And with difficulty,<br>effort, and stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty on its<br>hinges, a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from<br>that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre with<br>a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been<br>thinking—especially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him, and<br>enveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer possible,<br>it was Natásha and he loved her.<br><br>At that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess Mary,<br>and above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had been unaware.<br>He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He tried to hide his<br>agitation. But the more he tried to hide it the more clearly—clearer<br>than any words could have done—did he betray to himself, to her, and to<br>Princess Mary that he loved her.<br><br>“No, it’s only the unexpectedness of it,” thought Pierre. But as soon as<br>he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Mary he<br>again glanced at Natásha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and<br>a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul. He<br>became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was<br>saying.<br><br>Pierre had failed to notice Natásha because he did not at all expect to<br>see her there, but he had failed to recognize her because the change in<br>her since he last saw her was immense. She had grown thin and pale, but<br>that was not what made her unrecognizable; she was unrecognizable at the<br>moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with<br>a suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when he first entered and<br>glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes<br>were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative.<br><br>Pierre’s confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Natásha’s part,<br>but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>“She has come to stay with me,” said Princess Mary. “The count and<br>countess will be here in a few days. The countess is in a dreadful<br>state; but it was necessary for Natásha herself to see a doctor. They<br>insisted on her coming with me.”<br><br>“Yes, is there a family free from sorrow now?” said Pierre, addressing<br>Natásha. “You know it happened the very day we were rescued. I saw him.<br>What a delightful boy he was!”<br><br>Natásha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes<br>widened and lit up.<br><br>“What can one say or think of as a consolation?” said Pierre. “Nothing!<br>Why had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?”<br><br>“Yes, in these days it would be hard to live without faith...” remarked<br>Princess Mary.<br><br>“Yes, yes, that is really true,” Pierre hastily interrupted her.<br><br>“Why is it true?” Natásha asked, looking attentively into Pierre’s eyes.<br><br>“How can you ask why?” said Princess Mary. “The thought alone of what<br>awaits...”<br><br>Natásha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again looked<br>inquiringly at Pierre.<br><br>“And because,” Pierre continued, “only one who believes that there is a<br>God ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and... yours.”<br><br>Natásha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped.<br>Pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed Princess Mary,<br>asking about his friend’s last days.<br><br>Pierre’s confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time he felt<br>that his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that there was now a<br>judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to<br>him than that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke now he was<br>considering what impression his words would make on Natásha. He did<br>not purposely say things to please her, but whatever he was saying he<br>regarded from her standpoint.<br><br>Princess Mary—reluctantly as is usual in such cases—began telling of<br>the condition in which she had found Prince Andrew. But Pierre’s face<br>quivering with emotion, his questions and his eager restless expression,<br>gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall<br>for her own sake.<br><br>“Yes, yes, and so...?” Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with<br>his whole body and eagerly listened to her story. “Yes, yes... so he<br>grew tranquil and softened? With all his soul he had always sought<br>one thing—to be perfectly good—so he could not be afraid of death. The<br>faults he had—if he had any—were not of his making. So he did soften?...<br>What a happy thing that he saw you again,” he added, suddenly turning to<br>Natásha and looking at her with eyes full of tears.<br><br>Natásha’s face twitched. She frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment.<br>She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not.<br><br>“Yes, that was happiness,” she then said in her quiet voice with its<br>deep chest notes. “For me it certainly was happiness.” She paused. “And<br>he... he... he said he was wishing for it at the very moment I entered<br>the room....”<br><br>Natásha’s voice broke. She blushed, pressed her clasped hands on her<br>knees, and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her<br>head and began to speak rapidly.<br><br>“We knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare to<br>ask about him. Then suddenly Sónya told me he was traveling with us. I<br>had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in, all I wanted was<br>to see him and be with him,” she said, trembling, and breathing quickly.<br><br>And not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had<br>never yet mentioned to anyone—all she had lived through during those<br>three weeks of their journey and life at Yaroslávl.<br><br>Pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of<br>tears. As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of death,<br>nor of what she was telling. He listened to her and felt only pity for<br>her, for what she was suffering now while she was speaking.<br><br>Princess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat beside<br>Natásha, and heard for the first time the story of those last days of<br>her brother’s and Natásha’s love.<br><br>Evidently Natásha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.<br><br>She spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of<br>her soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish. Several times she<br>repeated the same thing twice.<br><br>Dessalles’ voice was heard outside the door asking whether little<br>Nicholas might come in to say good night.<br><br>“Well, that’s all—everything,” said Natásha.<br><br>She got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to the door<br>which was hidden by curtains, struck her head against it, and rushed<br>from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow.<br><br>Pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not<br>understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.<br><br>Princess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention<br>to her nephew who had entered the room.<br><br>At that moment of emotional tenderness young Nicholas’ face, which<br>resembled his father’s, affected Pierre so much that when he had kissed<br>the boy he got up quickly, took out his handkerchief, and went to the<br>window. He wished to take leave of Princess Mary, but she would not let<br>him go.<br><br>“No, Natásha and I sometimes don’t go to sleep till after two, so please<br>don’t go. I will order supper. Go downstairs, we will come immediately.”<br><br>Before Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him: “This is the first<br>time she has talked of him like that.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVII<br><br>Pierre was shown into the large, brightly lit dining room; a few minutes<br>later he heard footsteps and Princess Mary entered with Natásha. Natásha<br>was calm, though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her<br>face. They all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness<br>which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk. It is<br>impossible to go back to the same conversation, to talk of trifles is<br>awkward, and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like<br>affectation. They went silently to table. The footmen drew back the<br>chairs and pushed them up again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin<br>and, resolving to break the silence, looked at Natásha and at Princess<br>Mary. They had evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of<br>both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life<br>also has joy.<br><br>“Do you take vodka, Count?” asked Princess Mary, and those words<br>suddenly banished the shadows of the past. “Now tell us about yourself,”<br>said she. “One hears such improbable wonders about you.”<br><br>“Yes,” replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him.<br>“They even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of! Mary Abrámovna<br>invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened, or ought<br>to have happened, to me. Stepán Stepánych also instructed me how I ought<br>to tell of my experiences. In general I have noticed that it is very<br>easy to be an interesting man (I am an interesting man now); people<br>invite me out and tell me all about myself.”<br><br>Natásha smiled and was on the point of speaking.<br><br>“We have been told,” Princess Mary interrupted her, “that you lost two<br>millions in Moscow. Is that true?”<br><br>“But I am three times as rich as before,” returned Pierre.<br><br>Though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wife’s<br>debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that he had<br>become three times as rich as before.<br><br>“What I have certainly gained is freedom,” he began seriously, but did<br>not continue, noticing that this theme was too egotistic.<br><br>“And are you building?”<br><br>“Yes. Savélich says I must!”<br><br>“Tell me, you did not know of the countess’ death when you decided to<br>remain in Moscow?” asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed, noticing<br>that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed to his<br>words a meaning he had perhaps not intended.<br><br>“No,” answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning<br>Princess Mary had given to his words. “I heard of it in Orël and you<br>cannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,” he<br>added quickly, glancing at Natásha and noticing on her face curiosity as<br>to how he would speak of his wife, “but her death shocked me terribly.<br>When two people quarrel they are always both in fault, and one’s own<br>guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer<br>alive. And then such a death... without friends and without consolation!<br>I am very, very sorry for her,” he concluded, and was pleased to notice<br>a look of glad approval on Natásha’s face.<br><br>“Yes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor,” said Princess<br>Mary.<br><br>Pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look<br>at Natásha. When he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold,<br>stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.<br><br>“And did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been told?”<br>said Princess Mary.<br><br>Pierre laughed.<br><br>“No, not once! Everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner<br>means being Napoleon’s guest. Not only did I never see him but I heard<br>nothing about him—I was in much lower company!”<br><br>Supper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his<br>captivity was gradually led on to do so.<br><br>“But it’s true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?” Natásha<br>asked with a slight smile. “I guessed it then when we met at the<br>Súkharev tower, do you remember?”<br><br>Pierre admitted that it was true, and from that was gradually led by<br>Princess Mary’s questions and especially by Natásha’s into giving a<br>detailed account of his adventures.<br><br>At first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with<br>him toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he came<br>to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was<br>unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed<br>emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he<br>has lived through.<br><br>Princess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at<br>Natásha. In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his goodness.<br>Natásha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face constantly<br>changing with the narrative, watched Pierre with an attention that never<br>wandered—evidently herself experiencing all that he described. Not only<br>her look, but her exclamations and the brief questions she put, showed<br>Pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey. It was clear<br>that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to,<br>but could not, express in words. The account Pierre gave of the incident<br>with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was<br>this: “It was an awful sight—children abandoned, some in the flames...<br>One was snatched out before my eyes... and there were women who had<br>their things snatched off and their earrings torn out...” he flushed and<br>grew confused. “Then a patrol arrived and all the men—all those who were<br>not looting, that is—were arrested, and I among them.”<br><br>“I am sure you’re not telling us everything; I am sure you did<br>something...” said Natásha and pausing added, “something fine?”<br><br>Pierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass<br>over the horrible details, but Natásha insisted that he should not omit<br>anything.<br><br>Pierre began to tell about Karatáev, but paused. By this time he had<br>risen from the table and was pacing the room, Natásha following him with<br>her eyes. Then he added:<br><br>“No, you can’t understand what I learned from that illiterate man—that<br>simple fellow.”<br><br>“Yes, yes, go on!” said Natásha. “Where is he?”<br><br>“They killed him almost before my eyes.”<br><br>And Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of the last<br>days of their retreat, of Karatáev’s illness and his death.<br><br>He told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. He now, as<br>it were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now that he was<br>telling it all to Natásha he experienced that pleasure which a man has<br>when women listen to him—not clever women who when listening either try<br>to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity<br>offers to retell it, or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their<br>own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their<br>little mental workshop—but the pleasure given by real women gifted with<br>a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself.<br>Natásha without knowing it was all attention: she did not lose a word,<br>no single quiver in Pierre’s voice, no look, no twitch of a muscle in<br>his face, nor a single gesture. She caught the unfinished word in its<br>flight and took it straight into her open heart, divining the secret<br>meaning of all Pierre’s mental travail.<br><br>Princess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, but she<br>now saw something else that absorbed all her attention. She saw the<br>possibility of love and happiness between Natásha and Pierre, and the<br>first thought of this filled her heart with gladness.<br><br>It was three o’clock in the morning. The footmen came in with sad and<br>stern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed them.<br><br>Pierre finished his story. Natásha continued to look at him intently<br>with bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to understand<br>something more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre in shamefaced<br>and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to think what<br>to say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess Mary was silent. It<br>occurred to none of them that it was three o’clock and time to go to<br>bed.<br><br>“People speak of misfortunes and sufferings,” remarked Pierre, “but if<br>at this moment I were asked: ‘Would you rather be what you were before<br>you were taken prisoner, or go through all this again?’ then for<br>heaven’s sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh! We imagine<br>that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, but it is<br>only then that what is new and good begins. While there is life there is<br>happiness. There is much, much before us. I say this to you,” he added,<br>turning to Natásha.<br><br>“Yes, yes,” she said, answering something quite different. “I too should<br>wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning.”<br><br>Pierre looked intently at her.<br><br>“Yes, and nothing more,” said Natásha.<br><br>“It’s not true, not true!” cried Pierre. “I am not to blame for being<br>alive and wishing to live—nor you either.”<br><br>Suddenly Natásha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and<br>began to cry.<br><br>“What is it, Natásha?” said Princess Mary.<br><br>“Nothing, nothing.” She smiled at Pierre through her tears. “Good night!<br>It is time for bed.”<br><br>Pierre rose and took his leave.<br><br><br>Princess Mary and Natásha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked of<br>what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her opinion of<br>Pierre nor did Natásha speak of him.<br><br>“Well, good night, Mary!” said Natásha. “Do you know, I am often afraid<br>that by not speaking of him” (she meant Prince Andrew) “for fear of not<br>doing justice to our feelings, we forget him.”<br><br>Princess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of<br>Natásha’s remark, but she did not express agreement in words.<br><br>“Is it possible to forget?” said she.<br><br>“It did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and<br>painful, but good, very good!” said Natásha. “I am sure he really loved<br>him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?” she added, suddenly<br>blushing.<br><br>“To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!” said Princess<br>Mary.<br><br>“Do you know, Mary...” Natásha suddenly said with a mischievous smile<br>such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, “he has<br>somehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh—as if he had just come out of<br>a Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. Isn’t it true?”<br><br>“Yes,” replied Princess Mary. “He has greatly improved.”<br><br>“With a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as if he<br>had come straight from the bath... Papa used to...”<br><br>“I understand why he” (Prince Andrew) “liked no one so much as him,”<br>said Princess Mary.<br><br>“Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when they<br>are quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike him—in<br>everything.”<br><br>“Yes, but he’s wonderful.”<br><br>“Well, good night,” said Natásha.<br><br>And the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as<br>if it had been forgotten there.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVIII<br><br>It was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. He paced<br>up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem<br>and frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, and now<br>smiling happily.<br><br>He was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Natásha, and of their love, at one<br>moment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that feeling.<br>It was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the<br>room.<br><br>“Well, what’s to be done if it cannot be avoided? What’s to be done?<br>Evidently it has to be so,” said he to himself, and hastily undressing<br>he got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or<br>indecision.<br><br>“Strange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do everything<br>that she and I may be man and wife,” he told himself.<br><br>A few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the<br>Friday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Savélich came to ask him about<br>packing for the journey.<br><br>“What, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?”<br>he asked involuntarily, though only to himself. “Oh, yes, long ago<br>before this happened I did for some reason mean to go to Petersburg,”<br>he reflected. “Why? But perhaps I shall go. What a good fellow he is and<br>how attentive, and how he remembers everything,” he thought, looking at<br>Savélich’s old face, “and what a pleasant smile he has!”<br><br>“Well, Savélich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?” Pierre<br>asked him.<br><br>“What’s the good of freedom to me, your excellency? We lived under the<br>late count—the kingdom of heaven be his!—and we have lived under you<br>too, without ever being wronged.”<br><br>“And your children?”<br><br>“The children will live just the same. With such masters one can live.”<br><br>“But what about my heirs?” said Pierre. “Supposing I suddenly marry...<br>it might happen,” he added with an involuntary smile.<br><br>“If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good thing.”<br><br>“How easy he thinks it,” thought Pierre. “He doesn’t know how terrible<br>it is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is terrible!”<br><br>“So what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?” asked Savélich.<br><br>“No, I’ll put it off for a bit. I’ll tell you later. You must forgive<br>the trouble I have put you to,” said Pierre, and seeing Savélich smile,<br>he thought: “But how strange it is that he should not know that now<br>there is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be settled first of<br>all! But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. Shall<br>I have a talk with him and see what he thinks?” Pierre reflected. “No,<br>another time.”<br><br>At breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had been to<br>see Princess Mary the day before and had there met—“Whom do you think?<br>Natásha Rostóva!”<br><br>The princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he<br>had seen Anna Semënovna.<br><br>“Do you know her?” asked Pierre.<br><br>“I have seen the princess,” she replied. “I heard that they were<br>arranging a match for her with young Rostóv. It would be a very good<br>thing for the Rostóvs, they are said to be utterly ruined.”<br><br>“No; I mean do you know Natásha Rostóva?”<br><br>“I heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a great pity.”<br><br>“No, she either doesn’t understand or is pretending,” thought Pierre.<br>“Better not say anything to her either.”<br><br>The princess too had prepared provisions for Pierre’s journey.<br><br>“How kind they all are,” thought Pierre. “What is surprising is that<br>they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of<br>interest to them. And all for me!”<br><br>On the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him to send<br>a representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things that were to be<br>returned to their owners that day.<br><br>“And this man too,” thought Pierre, looking into the face of the Chief<br>of Police. “What a fine, good-looking officer and how kind. Fancy<br>bothering about such trifles now! And they actually say he is not honest<br>and takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn’t he take bribes?<br>That’s the way he was brought up, and everybody does it. But what a<br>kind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me.”<br><br>Pierre went to Princess Mary’s to dinner.<br><br>As he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned<br>down, he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The picturesqueness<br>of the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters<br>of the town, stretching out and concealing one another, reminded him of<br>the Rhine and the Colosseum. The cabmen he met and their passengers,<br>the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes, the women<br>hawkers, and the shopkeepers, all looked at him with cheerful beaming<br>eyes that seemed to say: “Ah, there he is! Let’s see what will come of<br>it!”<br><br>At the entrance to Princess Mary’s house Pierre felt doubtful whether<br>he had really been there the night before and really seen Natásha and<br>talked to her. “Perhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find<br>no one there.” But he had hardly entered the room before he felt her<br>presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom. She<br>was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the<br>same way as the day before, yet she was quite different. Had she been<br>like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have<br>failed to recognize her.<br><br>She was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince<br>Andrew’s fiancée. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on<br>her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.<br><br>Pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there, but<br>Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her.<br><br>Next day he came early, dined, and stayed the whole evening. Though<br>Princess Mary and Natásha were evidently glad to see their visitor and<br>though all Pierre’s interest was now centered in that house, by the<br>evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from<br>one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long<br>that Princess Mary and Natásha exchanged glances, evidently wondering<br>when he would go. Pierre noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy<br>and embarrassed, but sat on because he simply could not get up and take<br>his leave.<br><br>Princess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining of<br>a headache began to say good night.<br><br>“So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?” she asked.<br><br>“No, I am not going,” Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone and as<br>though offended. “Yes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrow—but I won’t say<br>good-by yet. I will call round in case you have any commissions for me,”<br>said he, standing before Princess Mary and turning red, but not taking<br>his departure.<br><br>Natásha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other hand<br>instead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly and<br>intently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she<br>had plainly shown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and<br>long-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.<br><br>When Natásha left the room Pierre’s confusion and awkwardness<br>immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement. He quickly<br>moved an armchair toward Princess Mary.<br><br>“Yes, I wanted to tell you,” said he, answering her look as if she had<br>spoken. “Princess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess, my<br>dear friend, listen! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of her, I<br>know it’s impossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a brother to<br>her. No, not that, I don’t, I can’t...”<br><br>He paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands.<br><br>“Well,” he went on with an evident effort at self-control and coherence.<br>“I don’t know when I began to love her, but I have loved her and her<br>alone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life without<br>her. I cannot propose to her at present, but the thought that<br>perhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that<br>possibility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope?<br>Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!” he added after a pause, and<br>touched her hand as she did not reply.<br><br>“I am thinking of what you have told me,” answered Princess Mary.<br>“This is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love at<br>present...”<br><br>Princess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love was<br>impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change<br>in Natásha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre<br>spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for.<br><br>“To speak to her now wouldn’t do,” said the princess all the same.<br><br>“But what am I to do?”<br><br>“Leave it to me,” said Princess Mary. “I know...”<br><br>Pierre was looking into Princess Mary’s eyes.<br><br>“Well?... Well?...” he said.<br><br>“I know that she loves... will love you,” Princess Mary corrected<br>herself.<br><br>Before her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened<br>expression seized Princess Mary’s hand.<br><br>“What makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?”<br><br>“Yes, I think so,” said Princess Mary with a smile. “Write to her<br>parents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it to<br>happen and my heart tells me it will.”<br><br>“No, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can’t be.... How happy I am!<br>No, it can’t be!” Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Mary’s hands.<br><br>“Go to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,” she<br>said.<br><br>“To Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I’ll go. But I may come again<br>tomorrow?”<br><br>Next day Pierre came to say good-by. Natásha was less animated than<br>she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre<br>sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she<br>existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. “Is it possible?<br>No, it can’t be,” he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that<br>filled his soul with joy.<br><br>When on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could not help<br>holding it a little longer in his own.<br><br>“Is it possible that this hand, that face, those eyes, all this treasure<br>of feminine charm so strange to me now, is it possible that it will one<br>day be mine forever, as familiar to me as I am to myself?... No, that’s<br>impossible!...”<br><br>“Good-by, Count,” she said aloud. “I shall look forward very much to<br>your return,” she added in a whisper.<br><br>And these simple words, her look, and the expression on her face which<br>accompanied them, formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible<br>memories, interpretations, and happy meditations for Pierre. “‘I shall<br>look forward very much to your return....’ Yes, yes, how did she say it?<br>Yes, ‘I shall look forward very much to your return.’ Oh, how happy I<br>am! What is happening to me? How happy I am!” said Pierre to himself.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIX<br><br>There was nothing in Pierre’s soul now at all like what had troubled it<br>during his courtship of Hélène.<br><br>He did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words<br>he had spoken, or say: “Oh, why did I not say that?” and, “Whatever made<br>me say ‘Je vous aime’?” On the contrary, he now repeated in imagination<br>every word that he or Natásha had spoken and pictured every detail of<br>her face and smile, and did not wish to diminish or add anything, but<br>only to repeat it again and again. There was now not a shadow of doubt<br>in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong.<br>Only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind: “Wasn’t it all<br>a dream? Isn’t Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too conceited and<br>self-confident? I believe all this—and suddenly Princess Mary will tell<br>her, and she will be sure to smile and say: ‘How strange! He must be<br>deluding himself. Doesn’t he know that he is a man, just a man, while<br>I...? I am something altogether different and higher.’”<br><br>That was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now make any<br>plans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only<br>he could attain it, it would be the end of all things. Everything ended<br>with that.<br><br>A joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself incapable,<br>possessed him. The whole meaning of life—not for him alone but for the<br>whole world—seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of<br>being loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with<br>one thing only—his future happiness. Sometimes it seemed to him that<br>other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to<br>hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests. In<br>every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness. He often<br>surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which<br>seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them. And when<br>he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied<br>them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them<br>that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of<br>attention.<br><br>When it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service,<br>or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the<br>assumption that everybody’s welfare depended on this or that issue<br>of events, he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise<br>people by his strange comments. But at this time he saw everybody—both<br>those who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning of life (that<br>is, what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who evidently did not<br>understand it—in the bright light of the emotion that shone within<br>himself, and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met<br>everything that was good and worthy of being loved.<br><br>When dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife, her memory<br>aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he<br>now knew. Prince Vasíli, who having obtained a new post and some<br>fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time, seemed to him a<br>pathetic, kindly old man much to be pitied.<br><br>Often in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity. All<br>the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true<br>for him always. He not only did not renounce them subsequently, but when<br>he was in doubt or inwardly at variance, he referred to the views he had<br>held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct.<br><br>“I may have appeared strange and queer then,” he thought, “but I was<br>not so mad as I seemed. On the contrary I was then wiser and had<br>more insight than at any other time, and understood all that is worth<br>understanding in life, because... because I was happy.”<br><br>Pierre’s insanity consisted in not waiting, as he used to do, to<br>discover personal attributes which he termed “good qualities” in people<br>before loving them; his heart was now overflowing with love, and by<br>loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving<br>them.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XX<br><br>After Pierre’s departure that first evening, when Natásha had said to<br>Princess Mary with a gaily mocking smile: “He looks just, yes, just as<br>if he had come out of a Russian bath—in a short coat and with his hair<br>cropped,” something hidden and unknown to herself, but irrepressible,<br>awoke in Natásha’s soul.<br><br>Everything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly altered.<br>To her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the<br>surface and demanded satisfaction. From that evening she seemed to have<br>forgotten all that had happened to her. She no longer complained of her<br>position, did not say a word about the past, and no longer feared to<br>make happy plans for the future. She spoke little of Pierre, but when<br>Princess Mary mentioned him a long-extinguished light once more kindled<br>in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile.<br><br>The change that took place in Natásha at first surprised Princess Mary;<br>but when she understood its meaning it grieved her. “Can she have loved<br>my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?” she thought<br>when she reflected on the change. But when she was with Natásha she was<br>not vexed with her and did not reproach her. The reawakened power<br>of life that had seized Natásha was so evidently irrepressible and<br>unexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt that she had<br>no right to reproach her even in her heart.<br><br>Natásha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that<br>she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but bright<br>and cheerful.<br><br>When Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with<br>Pierre, Natásha met her on the threshold.<br><br>“He has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?” she repeated.<br><br>And a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for<br>her joy settled on Natásha’s face.<br><br>“I wanted to listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me.”<br><br>Understandable and touching as the look with which Natásha gazed at<br>her seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her agitation,<br>these words pained her for a moment. She remembered her brother and his<br>love.<br><br>“But what’s to be done? She can’t help it,” thought the princess.<br><br>And with a sad and rather stern look she told Natásha all that Pierre<br>had said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg Natásha was<br>astounded.<br><br>“To Petersburg!” she repeated as if unable to understand.<br><br>But noticing the grieved expression on Princess Mary’s face she guessed<br>the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry.<br><br>“Mary,” said she, “tell me what I should do! I am afraid of being bad.<br>Whatever you tell me, I will do. Tell me....”<br><br>“You love him?”<br><br>“Yes,” whispered Natásha.<br><br>“Then why are you crying? I am happy for your sake,” said Princess Mary,<br>who because of those tears quite forgave Natásha’s joy.<br><br>“It won’t be just yet—someday. Think what fun it will be when I am his<br>wife and you marry Nicholas!”<br><br>“Natásha, I have asked you not to speak of that. Let us talk about you.”<br><br>They were silent awhile.<br><br>“But why go to Petersburg?” Natásha suddenly asked, and hastily replied<br>to her own question. “But no, no, he must... Yes, Mary, He must....”<br><br><br><br><br><br>FIRST EPILOGUE: 1813 - 20<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>Seven years had passed. The storm-tossed sea of European history had<br>subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the<br>mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of<br>their motion are unknown to us) continued to operate.<br><br>Though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, the movement<br>of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time. Various groups<br>of people formed and dissolved, the coming formation and dissolution of<br>kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation.<br><br>The sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as<br>previously. It was seething in its depths. Historic figures were not<br>borne by the waves from one shore to another as before. They now seemed<br>to rotate on one spot. The historical figures at the head of armies,<br>who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars,<br>campaigns, and battles, now reflected the restless movement by political<br>and diplomatic combinations, laws, and treaties.<br><br>The historians call this activity of the historical figures “the<br>reaction.”<br><br>In dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical<br>personages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as the<br>reaction. All the well-known people of that period, from Alexander and<br>Napoleon to Madame de Staël, Photius, Schelling, Fichte, Chateaubriand,<br>and the rest, pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or<br>condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction.<br><br>According to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in Russia<br>also, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the same man who according<br>to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement<br>of his reign, being the savior of Russia.<br><br>There is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist to<br>learned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander for<br>things he did wrong at this period of his reign.<br><br>“He ought to have acted in this way and in that way. In this case he did<br>well and in that case badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning of<br>his reign and during 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution<br>to Poland, forming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power to Arakchéev,<br>favoring Golítsyn and mysticism, and afterwards Shishkóv and Photius.<br>He also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and<br>disbanding the Semënov regiment.”<br><br>It would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the<br>historians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for<br>humanity.<br><br>What do these reproaches mean?<br><br>Do not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander I<br>(the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with<br>Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813)<br>flow from the same sources—the circumstances of his birth, education,<br>and life—that made his personality what it was and from which the<br>actions for which they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the restoration of<br>Poland, and the reaction of 1820 and later) also flowed?<br><br>In what does the substance of those reproaches lie?<br><br>It lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I,<br>standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the<br>blinding light of history focused upon him; a character exposed to those<br>strongest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception<br>inseparable from power; a character who at every moment of his life<br>felt a responsibility for all that was happening in Europe; and not<br>a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal<br>habits, passions, and impulses toward goodness, beauty, and truth—that<br>this character—though not lacking in virtue (the historians do not<br>accuse him of that)—had not the same conception of the welfare of<br>humanity fifty years ago as a present-day professor who from his<br>youth upwards has been occupied with learning: that is, with books and<br>lectures and with taking notes from them.<br><br>But even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexander I was mistaken in<br>his view of what was good for the people, we must inevitably assume that<br>the historian who judges Alexander will also after the lapse of some<br>time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity.<br>This assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because, watching<br>the movement of history, we see that every year and with each new<br>writer, opinion as to what is good for mankind changes; so that what<br>once seemed good, ten years later seems bad, and vice versa. And what is<br>more, we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to<br>what is bad and what is good in history: some people regard giving a<br>constitution to Poland and forming the Holy Alliance as praiseworthy in<br>Alexander, while others regard it as blameworthy.<br><br>The activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful or<br>harmful, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful.<br>If that activity displeases somebody, this is only because it does<br>not agree with his limited understanding of what is good. Whether the<br>preservation of my father’s house in Moscow, or the glory of the Russian<br>arms, or the prosperity of the Petersburg and other universities, or the<br>freedom of Poland or the greatness of Russia, or the balance of power in<br>Europe, or a certain kind of European culture called “progress” appear<br>to me to be good or bad, I must admit that besides these things the<br>action of every historic character has other more general purposes<br>inaccessible to me.<br><br>But let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all<br>contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by<br>which to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexander<br>could have done everything differently; let us say that with guidance<br>from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the<br>movement of humanity, he might have arranged matters according to<br>the program his present accusers would have given him—of nationality,<br>freedom, equality, and progress (these, I think, cover the ground). Let<br>us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated,<br>and that Alexander had acted on it. What would then have become of the<br>activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in<br>the government—an activity that in the opinion of the historians was<br>good and beneficent? Their activity would not have existed: there would<br>have been no life, there would have been nothing.<br><br>If we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the possibility of<br>life is destroyed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>If we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the<br>attainment of certain ends—the greatness of Russia or of France,<br>the balance of power in Europe, the diffusion of the ideas of the<br>Revolution, general progress, or anything else—then it is impossible<br>to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of<br>chance and genius.<br><br>If the aim of the European wars at the beginning of the nineteenth<br>century had been the aggrandizement of Russia, that aim might have been<br>accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion. If<br>the aim was the aggrandizement of France, that might have been attained<br>without the Revolution and without the Empire. If the aim was the<br>dissemination of ideas, the printing press could have accomplished that<br>much better than warfare. If the aim was the progress of civilization,<br>it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization<br>more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives.<br><br>Why did it happen in this and not in some other way?<br><br>Because it happened so! “Chance created the situation; genius utilized<br>it,” says history.<br><br>But what is chance? What is genius?<br><br>The words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and<br>therefore cannot be defined. Those words only denote a certain stage of<br>understanding of phenomena. I do not know why a certain event occurs; I<br>think that I cannot know it; so I do not try to know it and I talk about<br>chance. I see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary<br>human agencies; I do not understand why this occurs and I talk of<br>genius.<br><br>To a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a<br>special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others<br>must seem to be a genius. And it must appear an astonishing conjunction<br>of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram,<br>who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a<br>special enclosure where there are oats—that this very ram, swelling with<br>fat, is killed for meat.<br><br>But the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them<br>happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; they need only<br>admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken,<br>and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened<br>to the ram that was fattened. Even if they do not know for what purpose<br>they are fattened, they will at least know that all that happened to the<br>ram did not happen accidentally, and will no longer need the conceptions<br>of chance or genius.<br><br>Only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately<br>intelligible to us, and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our<br>ken, may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of<br>historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce<br>(incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities), and then the words<br>chance and genius become superfluous.<br><br>We need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European<br>convulsions and that we know only the facts—that is, the murders, first<br>in France, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria, in Spain,<br>and in Russia—and that the movements from the west to the east and from<br>the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events, and<br>not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in<br>Napoleon and Alexander, but we shall be unable to consider them to<br>be anything but like other men, and we shall not be obliged to have<br>recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made<br>these people what they were, but it will be clear that all those small<br>events were inevitable.<br><br>By discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose, we shall<br>clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for<br>any single plant better suited to it than those it produces, so it is<br>impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the<br>smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill, than Napoleon and<br>Alexander with all their antecedents.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>The fundamental and essential significance of the European events of the<br>beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of<br>the European peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west.<br>The commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east.<br>For the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement<br>to Moscow it was necessary: (1) that they should form themselves into<br>a military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike<br>military group of the east, (2) that they should abandon all established<br>traditions and customs, and (3) that during their military movement they<br>should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them<br>the deceptions, robberies, and murders which would have to be committed<br>during that movement.<br><br>And beginning with the French Revolution the old inadequately large<br>group was destroyed, as well as the old habits and traditions, and step<br>by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and<br>traditions, and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the<br>coming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done.<br><br>A man without convictions, without habits, without traditions, without<br>a name, and not even a Frenchman, emerges—by what seem the strangest<br>chances—from among all the seething French parties, and without joining<br>any one of them is borne forward to a prominent position.<br><br>The ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and insignificance of<br>his opponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling and<br>self-confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the<br>army. The brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to Italy,<br>his opponents’ reluctance to fight, and his own childish audacity and<br>self-confidence secure him military fame. Innumerable so-called chances<br>accompany him everywhere. The disfavor into which he falls with the<br>rulers of France turns to his advantage. His attempts to avoid his<br>predestined path are unsuccessful: he is not received into the Russian<br>service, and the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes to nothing. During<br>the war in Italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and<br>each time is saved in an unexpected manner. Owing to various diplomatic<br>considerations the Russian armies—just those which might have destroyed<br>his prestige—do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there.<br><br>On his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris in a process<br>of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped<br>out and destroyed. And by chance an escape from this dangerous position<br>presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition<br>to Africa. Again so-called chance accompanies him. Impregnable Malta<br>surrenders without a shot; his most reckless schemes are crowned with<br>success. The enemy’s fleet, which subsequently did not let a single boat<br>pass, allows his entire army to elude it. In Africa a whole series of<br>outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants. And the<br>men who commit these crimes, especially their leader, assure themselves<br>that this is admirable, this is glory—it resembles Caesar and Alexander<br>the Great and is therefore good.<br><br>This ideal of glory and grandeur—which consists not merely in<br>considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every<br>crime one commits, ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural<br>significance—that ideal, destined to guide this man and his associates,<br>had scope for its development in Africa. Whatever he does succeeds. The<br>plague does not touch him. The cruelty of murdering prisoners is not<br>imputed to him as a fault. His childishly rash, uncalled-for, and<br>ignoble departure from Africa, leaving his comrades in distress, is<br>set down to his credit, and again the enemy’s fleet twice lets him slip<br>past. When, intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully,<br>he reaches Paris, the dissolution of the republican government, which a<br>year earlier might have ruined him, has reached its extreme limit, and<br>his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can<br>only serve to exalt him—and though he himself has no plan, he is quite<br>ready for his new rôle.<br><br>He had no plan, he was afraid of everything, but the parties snatched at<br>him and demanded his participation.<br><br>He alone—with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in Italy and<br>Egypt, his insane self-adulation, his boldness in crime and frankness in<br>lying—he alone could justify what had to be done.<br><br>He is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost apart from<br>his will and despite his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all his<br>mistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and<br>the conspiracy is crowned with success.<br><br>He is pushed into a meeting of the legislature. In alarm he wishes to<br>flee, considering himself lost. He pretends to fall into a swoon and<br>says senseless things that should have ruined him. But the once proud<br>and shrewd rulers of France, feeling that their part is played out, are<br>even more bewildered than he, and do not say the words they should have<br>said to destroy him and retain their power.<br><br>Chance, millions of chances, give him power, and all men as if by<br>agreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms the characters<br>of the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms the character<br>of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government; chance contrives<br>a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his<br>power. Chance puts the Duc d’Enghien in his hands and unexpectedly<br>causes him to kill him—thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than<br>in any other way that he had the right, since he had the might.<br>Chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an<br>expedition against England (which would inevitably have ruined him) he<br>never carries out that intention, but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and<br>the Austrians, who surrender without a battle. Chance and genius give<br>him the victory at Austerlitz; and by chance all men, not only the<br>French but all Europe—except England which does not take part in the<br>events about to happen—despite their former horror and detestation of<br>his crimes, now recognize his authority, the title he has given<br>himself, and his ideal of grandeur and glory, which seems excellent and<br>reasonable to them all.<br><br>As if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement, the<br>western forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806, 1807,<br>and 1809, gaining strength and growing. In 1811 the group of people that<br>had formed in France unites into one group with the peoples of Central<br>Europe. The strength of the justification of the man who stands at the<br>head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group. During<br>the ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all<br>the crowned heads of Europe. The discredited rulers of the world can<br>oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Napoleonic ideal of<br>glory and grandeur. One after another they hasten to display their<br>insignificance before him. The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek<br>the great man’s mercy; the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that<br>this man receives a daughter of the Caesars into his bed; the Pope, the<br>guardian of all that the nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for the<br>aggrandizement of the great man. It is not Napoleon who prepares himself<br>for the accomplishment of his role, so much as all those round him who<br>prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is<br>happening and has to happen. There is no step, no crime or petty fraud<br>he commits, which in the mouths of those around him is not at once<br>represented as a great deed. The most suitable fête the Germans can<br>devise for him is a celebration of Jena and Auerstädt. Not only is he<br>great, but so are his ancestors, his brothers, his stepsons, and his<br>brothers-in-law. Everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his<br>reason and to prepare him for his terrible part. And when he is ready so<br>too are the forces.<br><br>The invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal—Moscow. That<br>city is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing<br>armies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to Wagram. But<br>suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had<br>so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the<br>predestined goal, an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur—from<br>the cold in his head at Borodinó to the sparks which set Moscow on<br>fire, and the frosts—and instead of genius, stupidity and immeasurable<br>baseness become evident.<br><br>The invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances are now<br>not for Napoleon but always against him.<br><br>A countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a<br>remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east.<br>Attempted drives from east to west—similar to the contrary movements of<br>1805, 1807, and 1809—precede the great westward movement; there is the<br>same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion<br>of the people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitation<br>midway, and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached.<br><br>Paris, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government and army<br>are destroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his<br>actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable chance<br>occurs. The allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as the cause of<br>their sufferings. Deprived of power and authority, his crimes and his<br>craft exposed, he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten<br>years previously and one year later—an outlawed brigand. But by some<br>strange chance no one perceives this. His part is not yet ended. The man<br>who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand<br>is sent to an island two days’ sail from France, which for some reason<br>is presented to him as his dominion, and guards are given to him and<br>millions of money are paid him.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>The flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels. The<br>waves of the great movement abate, and on the calm surface eddies are<br>formed in which float the diplomatists, who imagine that they have<br>caused the floods to abate.<br><br>But the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed. The diplomatists<br>think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure<br>of natural forces; they anticipate war between their sovereigns; the<br>position seems to them insoluble. But the wave they feel to be rising<br>does not come from the quarter they expect. It rises again from the same<br>point as before—Paris. The last backwash of the movement from the west<br>occurs: a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable<br>diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of<br>history.<br><br>The man who had devastated France returns to France alone, without any<br>conspiracy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, but by<br>strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they<br>cursed the day before and will curse again a month later.<br><br>This man is still needed to justify the final collective act.<br><br>That act is performed.<br><br>The last rôle is played. The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his<br>powder and paint: he will not be wanted any more.<br><br>And some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself<br>in solitude on his island, justifying his actions by intrigues and lies<br>when the justification is no longer needed, and displaying to the whole<br>world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an<br>unseen hand directed his actions.<br><br>The manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor<br>shows him to us.<br><br>“See what you believed in!

And all this was found in Alexander I; all this had been<br>prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life: his education,<br>his early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded him, and by<br>Austerlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.<br><br>During the national war he was inactive because he was not needed. But<br>as soon as the necessity for a general European war presented itself he<br>appeared in his place at the given moment and, uniting the nations of<br>Europe, led them to the goal.<br><br>The goal is reached. After the final war of 1815 Alexander possesses all<br>possible power. How does he use it?<br><br>Alexander I—the pacifier of Europe, the man who from his early years<br>had striven only for his people’s welfare, the originator of the liberal<br>innovations in his fatherland—now that he seemed to possess the utmost<br>power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the<br>welfare of his peoples—at the time when Napoleon in exile was drawing<br>up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy<br>had he retained power—Alexander I, having fulfilled his mission and<br>feeling the hand of God upon him, suddenly recognizes the insignificance<br>of that supposed power, turns away from it, and gives it into the hands<br>of contemptible men whom he despises, saying only:<br><br>“Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Name!... I too am a man like the<br>rest of you. Let me live like a man and think of my soul and of God.”<br><br>As the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself, and<br>yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to<br>comprehend, so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet<br>has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man.<br><br>A bee settling on a flower has stung a child. And the child is afraid<br>of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people. A poet admires the<br>bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the<br>fragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen from<br>flowers and carry it to the hive, says that it exists to gather honey.<br>Another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely<br>says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear<br>a queen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices<br>that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil<br>fertilizes the latter, and sees in this the purpose of the bee’s<br>existence. Another, observing the migration of plants, notices that the<br>bee helps in this work, and may say that in this lies the purpose of the<br>bee. But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first,<br>the second, or any of the processes the human mind can discern. The<br>higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes,<br>the more obvious it becomes, that the ultimate purpose is beyond our<br>comprehension.<br><br>All that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to<br>other manifestations of life. And so it is with the purpose of historic<br>characters and nations.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>Natásha’s wedding to Bezúkhov, which took place in 1813, was the last<br>happy event in the family of the old Rostóvs. Count Ilyá Rostóv died<br>that same year and, as always happens, after the father’s death the<br>family group broke up.<br><br>The events of the previous year: the burning of Moscow and the flight<br>from it, the death of Prince Andrew, Natásha’s despair, Pétya’s death,<br>and the old countess’ grief fell blow after blow on the old count’s<br>head. He seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these<br>events, and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and<br>inviting further blows which would finish him. He seemed now frightened<br>and distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising.<br><br>The arrangements for Natásha’s marriage occupied him for a while. He<br>ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful, but<br>his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be: on the contrary it<br>evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him.<br><br>When Pierre and his wife had left, he grew very quiet and began to<br>complain of depression. A few days later he fell ill and took to his<br>bed. He realized from the first that he would not get up again, despite<br>the doctor’s encouragement. The countess passed a fortnight in an<br>armchair by his pillow without undressing. Every time she gave him<br>his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand. On his last day,<br>sobbing, he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having<br>dissipated their property—that being the chief fault of which he was<br>conscious. After receiving communion and unction he quietly died; and<br>next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects<br>to the deceased filled the house rented by the Rostóvs. All these<br>acquaintances, who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so<br>often laughed at him, now said, with a common feeling of self-reproach<br>and emotion, as if justifying themselves: “Well, whatever he may have<br>been he was a most worthy man. You don’t meet such men nowadays.... And<br>which of us has not weaknesses of his own?”<br><br>It was just when the count’s affairs had become so involved that it was<br>impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he<br>unexpectedly died.<br><br>Nicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when the news of his<br>father’s death reached him. He at once resigned his commission, and<br>without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to<br>Moscow. The state of the count’s affairs became quite obvious a month<br>after his death, surprising everyone by the immense total of small<br>debts the existence of which no one had suspected. The debts amounted to<br>double the value of the property.<br><br>Friends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance. But<br>he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father’s memory, which he<br>held sacred, and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the<br>inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts.<br><br>The creditors who had so long been silent, restrained by a vague<br>but powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the count’s<br>careless good nature, all proceeded to enforce their claims at once. As<br>always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get<br>paid first, and those who like Mítenka held promissory notes given them<br>as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors. Nicholas was<br>allowed no respite and no peace, and those who had seemed to pity<br>the old man—the cause of their losses (if they were losses)—now<br>remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the<br>debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them.<br><br>Not one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate was sold by<br>auction for half its value, and half the debts still remained<br>unpaid. Nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his<br>brother-in-law Bezúkhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due<br>for value received. And to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder, as<br>the creditors threatened, he re-entered the government service.<br><br>He could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at<br>the next vacancy, for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on<br>life; and so despite his reluctance to remain in Moscow among people who<br>had known him before, and despite his abhorrence of the civil service,<br>he accepted a post in Moscow in that service, doffed the uniform of<br>which he was so fond, and moved with his mother and Sónya to a small<br>house on the Sívtsev Vrazhók.<br><br>Natásha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time and had no<br>clear idea of Nicholas’ circumstances. Having borrowed money from his<br>brother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him.<br>His position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve<br>hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and Sónya,<br>but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty. The<br>countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she<br>had been used to from childhood and, unable to realize how hard it was<br>for her son, kept demanding now a carriage (which they did not keep) to<br>send for a friend, now some expensive article of food for herself, or<br>wine for her son, or money to buy a present as a surprise for Natásha or<br>Sónya, or for Nicholas himself.<br><br>Sónya kept house, attended on her aunt, read to her, put up with her<br>whims and secret ill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal their poverty<br>from the old countess. Nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted<br>to Sónya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her<br>patience and devotion, but tried to keep aloof from her.<br><br>He seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect, and<br>because there was nothing to reproach her with. She had all that people<br>are valued for, but little that could have made him love her. He felt<br>that the more he valued her the less he loved her. He had taken her at<br>her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all<br>that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in<br>any case be renewed.<br><br>Nicholas’ position became worse and worse. The idea of putting something<br>aside out of his salary proved a dream. Not only did he not save<br>anything, but to comply with his mother’s demands he even incurred some<br>small debts. He could see no way out of this situation. The idea of<br>marrying some rich woman, which was suggested to him by his female<br>relations, was repugnant to him. The other way out—his mother’s<br>death—never entered his head. He wished for nothing and hoped<br>for nothing, and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern<br>satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position. He tried<br>to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive<br>offers of assistance; he avoided all distraction and recreation, and<br>even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother, pace silently<br>up and down the room, and smoke one pipe after another. He seemed<br>carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled<br>him to endure his position.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>At the beginning of winter Princess Mary came to Moscow. From reports<br>current in town she learned how the Rostóvs were situated, and how “the<br>son has sacrificed himself for his mother,” as people were saying.<br><br>“I never expected anything else of him,” said Princess Mary to herself,<br>feeling a joyous sense of her love for him. Remembering her friendly<br>relations with all the Rostóvs which had made her almost a member of the<br>family, she thought it her duty to go to see them. But remembering her<br>relations with Nicholas in Vorónezh she was shy about doing so. Making<br>a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her<br>arrival in Moscow.<br><br>Nicholas was the first to meet her, as the countess’ room could only be<br>reached through his. But instead of being greeted with pleasure as she<br>had expected, at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold, stiff,<br>proud expression she had not seen on it before. He inquired about her<br>health, led the way to his mother, and having sat there for five minutes<br>left the room.<br><br>When the princess came out of the countess’ room Nicholas met her again,<br>and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom.<br>To her remarks about his mother’s health he made no reply. “What’s that<br>to you? Leave me in peace,” his looks seemed to say.<br><br>“Why does she come prowling here? What does she want? I can’t bear these<br>ladies and all these civilities!” said he aloud in Sónya’s presence,<br>evidently unable to repress his vexation, after the princess’ carriage<br>had disappeared.<br><br>“Oh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?” cried Sónya, hardly able to<br>conceal her delight. “She is so kind and Mamma is so fond of her!”<br><br>Nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any<br>more. But after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a<br>day.<br><br>She sang her praises, insisted that her son must call on her, expressed<br>a wish to see her often, but yet always became ill-humored when she<br>began to talk about her.<br><br>Nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess,<br>but his silence irritated her.<br><br>“She is a very admirable and excellent young woman,” said she, “and you<br>must go and call on her. You would at least be seeing somebody, and I<br>think it must be dull for you only seeing us.”<br><br>“But I don’t in the least want to, Mamma.”<br><br>“You used to want to, and now you don’t. Really I don’t understand you,<br>my dear. One day you are dull, and the next you refuse to see anyone.”<br><br>“But I never said I was dull.”<br><br>“Why, you said yourself you don’t want even to see her. She is a very<br>admirable young woman and you always liked her, but now suddenly you<br>have got some notion or other in your head. You hide everything from<br>me.”<br><br>“Not at all, Mamma.”<br><br>“If I were asking you to do something disagreeable now—but I only ask<br>you to return a call. One would think mere politeness required it....<br>Well, I have asked you, and now I won’t interfere any more since you<br>have secrets from your mother.”<br><br>“Well, then, I’ll go if you wish it.”<br><br>“It doesn’t matter to me. I only wish it for your sake.”<br><br>Nicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a<br>patience, trying to divert his mother’s attention to another topic.<br><br>The same conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and the<br>day after that.<br><br>After her visit to the Rostóvs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by<br>Nicholas, Princess Mary confessed to herself that she had been right in<br>not wishing to be the first to call.<br><br>“I expected nothing else,” she told herself, calling her pride to her<br>aid. “I have nothing to do with him and I only wanted to see the<br>old lady, who was always kind to me and to whom I am under many<br>obligations.”<br><br>But she could not pacify herself with these reflections; a feeling akin<br>to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit. Though she had<br>firmly resolved not to call on the Rostóvs again and to forget the whole<br>matter, she felt herself all the time in an awkward position. And when<br>she asked herself what distressed her, she had to admit that it was her<br>relation to Rostóv. His cold, polite manner did not express his feeling<br>for her (she knew that) but it concealed something, and until she could<br>discover what that something was, she felt that she could not be at<br>ease.<br><br>One day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her<br>nephew’s lessons, she was informed that Rostóv had called. With a firm<br>resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation, she sent<br>for Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.<br><br>Her first glance at Nicholas’ face told her that he had only come to<br>fulfill the demands of politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain<br>the tone in which he addressed her.<br><br>They spoke of the countess’ health, of their mutual friends, of the<br>latest war news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety had<br>elapsed after which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to say good-by.<br><br>With Mademoiselle Bourienne’s help the princess had maintained the<br>conversation very well, but at the very last moment, just when he rose,<br>she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, and her<br>mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little<br>happiness in life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat still, her<br>luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her, not noticing that he had risen.<br><br>Nicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice her<br>abstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then<br>again looked at the princess. She still sat motionless with a look of<br>suffering on her gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was<br>vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face<br>expressed. He wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could<br>think of nothing to say.<br><br>“Good-by, Princess!” said he.<br><br>She started, flushed, and sighed deeply.<br><br>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” she said as if waking up. “Are you going<br>already, Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion for the<br>countess!”<br><br>“Wait a moment, I’ll fetch it,” said Mademoiselle Bourienne, and she<br>left the room.<br><br>They both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another.<br><br>“Yes, Princess,” said Nicholas at last with a sad smile, “it doesn’t<br>seem long ago since we first met at Boguchárovo, but how much water<br>has flowed since then! In what distress we all seemed to be then, yet<br>I would give much to bring back that time... but there’s no bringing it<br>back.”<br><br>Princess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones<br>as he said this. She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of<br>his words which would explain his feeling for her.<br><br>“Yes, yes,” said she, “but you have no reason to regret the past, Count.<br>As I understand your present life, I think you will always recall it<br>with satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills it now...”<br><br>“I cannot accept your praise,” he interrupted her hurriedly. “On the<br>contrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at all an<br>interesting or cheerful subject.”<br><br>His face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression. But the<br>princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved, and it<br>was to him that she now spoke.<br><br>“I thought you would allow me to tell you this,” she said. “I had come<br>so near to you... and to all your family that I thought you would not<br>consider my sympathy misplaced, but I was mistaken,” and suddenly her<br>voice trembled. “I don’t know why,” she continued, recovering herself,<br>“but you used to be different, and...”<br><br>“There are a thousand reasons why,” laying special emphasis on the why.<br>“Thank you, Princess,” he added softly. “Sometimes it is hard.”<br><br>“So that’s why! That’s why!” a voice whispered in Princess Mary’s soul.<br>“No, it was not only that gay, kind, and frank look, not only that<br>handsome exterior, that I loved in him. I divined his noble, resolute,<br>self-sacrificing spirit too,” she said to herself. “Yes, he is poor now<br>and I am rich.... Yes, that’s the only reason.... Yes, were it not for<br>that...” And remembering his former tenderness, and looking now at his<br>kind, sorrowful face, she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness.<br><br>“But why, Count, why?” she almost cried, unconsciously moving closer to<br>him. “Why? Tell me. You must tell me!”<br><br>He was silent.<br><br>“I don’t understand your why, Count,” she continued, “but it’s hard for<br>me... I confess it. For some reason you wish to deprive me of our former<br>friendship. And that hurts me.” There were tears in her eyes and in her<br>voice. “I have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard<br>for me to bear.... Excuse me, good-by!” and suddenly she began to cry<br>and was hurrying from the room.<br><br>“Princess, for God’s sake!” he exclaimed, trying to stop her.<br>“Princess!”<br><br>She turned round. For a few seconds they gazed silently into one<br>another’s eyes—and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly became<br>possible, inevitable, and very near.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>In the winter of 1813 Nicholas married Princess Mary and moved to Bald<br>Hills with his wife, his mother, and Sónya.<br><br>Within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without<br>selling any of his wife’s property, and having received a small<br>inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre as well.<br><br>In another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs that he<br>was able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negotiating<br>to buy back Otrádnoe—that being his pet dream.<br><br>Having started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it<br>that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas was<br>a plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones<br>then coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate<br>management, disliked factories, the raising of expensive products,<br>and the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any<br>particular part of the work on his estate. He always had before his<br>mind’s eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it. The<br>chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen<br>in the air, nor manures, nor special plows, but that most important<br>agent by which nitrogen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made<br>effective—the peasant laborer. When Nicholas first began farming<br>and began to understand its different branches, it was the serf who<br>especially attracted his attention. The peasant seemed to him not merely<br>a tool, but also a judge of farming and an end in himself. At first<br>he watched the serfs, trying to understand their aims and what they<br>considered good and bad, and only pretended to direct them and give<br>orders while in reality learning from them their methods, their manner<br>of speech, and their judgment of what was good and bad. Only when he<br>had understood the peasants’ tastes and aspirations, had learned to talk<br>their language, to grasp the hidden meaning of their words, and felt<br>akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs, that is, to<br>perform toward them the duties demanded of him. And Nicholas’ management<br>produced very brilliant results.<br><br>Guided by some gift of insight, on taking up the management of the<br>estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and<br>delegate, the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they<br>had the right to choose, and these posts never changed hands. Before<br>analyzing the properties of manure, before entering into the debit and<br>credit (as he ironically called it), he found out how many cattle the<br>peasants had and increased the number by all possible means. He kept the<br>peasant families together in the largest groups possible, not allowing<br>the family groups to divide into separate households. He was hard alike<br>on the lazy, the depraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled<br>from the commune.<br><br>He was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants’ hay<br>and corn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown<br>and harvested so early and so well, or got so good a return, as did<br>Nicholas.<br><br>He disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs—the “drones”<br>as he called them—and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity. When<br>a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf, especially if one<br>had to be punished, he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in<br>the house; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted<br>instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation. He<br>never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that his<br>every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions.<br><br>He did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to<br>make things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined<br>to do so. He could not have said by what standard he judged what he<br>should or should not do, but the standard was quite firm and definite in<br>his own mind.<br><br>Often, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, he would<br>say: “What can one do with our Russian peasants?” and imagined that he<br>could not bear them.<br><br>Yet he loved “our Russian peasants” and their way of life with his whole<br>soul, and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one<br>way and manner of farming which produced good results.<br><br>Countess Mary was jealous of this passion of her husband’s and regretted<br>that she could not share it; but she could not understand the joys and<br>vexations he derived from that world, to her so remote and alien. She<br>could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy<br>when, after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the<br>fields or on the threshing floor, he returned from the sowing or mowing<br>or reaping to have tea with her. She did not understand why he spoke<br>with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and<br>well-to-do peasant Matthew Ermíshin, who with his family had carted<br>corn all night; or of the fact that his (Nicholas’) sheaves were already<br>stacked before anyone else had his harvest in. She did not understand<br>why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his<br>mustache and winked so joyfully, when warm steady rain began to fall<br>on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats, or why when the wind<br>carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return<br>from the barn, flushed, sunburned, and perspiring, with a smell of<br>wormwood and gentian in his hair and, gleefully rubbing his hands, would<br>say: “Well, one more day and my grain and the peasants’ will all be<br>under cover.”<br><br>Still less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always ready to<br>anticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate when she brought<br>him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her<br>to be excused some work; why he, that kind Nicholas, should obstinately<br>refuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her<br>business. She felt he had a world apart, which he loved passionately and<br>which had laws she had not fathomed.<br><br>Sometimes when, trying to understand him, she spoke of the good work he<br>was doing for his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: “Not in the least;<br>it never entered my head and I wouldn’t do that for their good! That’s<br>all poetry and old wives’ talk—all that doing good to one’s neighbor!<br>What I want is that our children should not have to go begging. I must<br>put our affairs in order while I am alive, that’s all. And to do that,<br>order and strictness are essential.... That’s all about it!” said he,<br>clenching his vigorous fist. “And fairness, of course,” he added, “for<br>if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse, he<br>can do no good either for himself or for me.”<br><br>And all Nicholas did was fruitful—probably just because he refused to<br>allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtue’s<br>sake. His means increased rapidly; serfs from neighboring estates came<br>to beg him to buy them, and long after his death the memory of his<br>administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs. “He was a<br>master... the peasants’ affairs first and then his own. Of course he was<br>not to be trifled with either—in a word, he was a real master!”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>One matter connected with his management sometimes worried Nicholas, and<br>that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making<br>free use of his fists. At first he saw nothing reprehensible in<br>this, but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of<br>punishment suddenly changed.<br><br>Once in summer he had sent for the village elder from Boguchárovo, a<br>man who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused of<br>dishonesty and various irregularities. Nicholas went out into the porch<br>to question him, and immediately after the elder had given a few replies<br>the sound of cries and blows were heard. On returning to lunch Nicholas<br>went up to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery<br>frame, and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that<br>morning. Among other things he spoke of the Boguchárovo elder. Countess<br>Mary turned red and then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and<br>lips compressed and gave her husband no reply.<br><br>“Such an insolent scoundrel!” he cried, growing hot again at the mere<br>recollection of him. “If he had told me he was drunk and did not see...<br>But what is the matter with you, Mary?” he suddenly asked.<br><br>Countess Mary raised her head and tried to speak, but hastily looked<br>down again and her lips puckered.<br><br>“Why, whatever is the matter, my dearest?”<br><br>The looks of the plain Countess Mary always improved when she was in<br>tears. She never cried from pain or vexation, but always from sorrow or<br>pity, and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm.<br><br>The moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself<br>and began to cry.<br><br>“Nicholas, I saw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!” and<br>she covered her face with her hands.<br><br>Nicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, left her side, and paced up<br>and down the room. He understood what she was weeping about, but could<br>not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded<br>from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong. “Is it just<br>sentimentality, old wives’ tales, or is she right?” he asked himself.<br>Before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with<br>love and pain, and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he<br>had long been sinning against himself.<br><br>“Mary,” he said softly, going up to her, “it will never happen again;<br>I give you my word. Never,” he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy<br>asking for forgiveness.<br><br>The tears flowed faster still from the countess’ eyes. She took his hand<br>and kissed it.<br><br>“Nicholas, when did you break your cameo?” she asked to change the<br>subject, looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of<br>Laocoön’s head.<br><br>“Today—it was the same affair. Oh, Mary, don’t remind me of it!” and<br>again he flushed. “I give you my word of honor it shan’t occur again,<br>and let this always be a reminder to me,” and he pointed to the broken<br>ring.<br><br>After that, when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the<br>blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench, Nicholas would<br>turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the<br>man who was making him angry. But he did forget himself once or twice<br>within a twelvemonth, and then he would go and confess to his wife, and<br>would again promise that this should really be the very last time.<br><br>“Mary, you must despise me!” he would say. “I deserve it.”<br><br>“You should go, go away at once, if you don’t feel strong enough to<br>control yourself,” she would reply sadly, trying to comfort her husband.<br><br>Among the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not liked.<br>He did not concern himself with the interests of his own class, and<br>consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid. The<br>whole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was busy with the work<br>on his farm. In autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same<br>business-like seriousness—leaving home for a month, or even two, with<br>his hunt. In winter he visited his other villages or spent his time<br>reading. The books he read were chiefly historical, and on these he<br>spent a certain sum every year. He was collecting, as he said, a serious<br>library, and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought.<br>He would sit in his study with a grave air, reading—a task he first<br>imposed upon himself as a duty, but which afterwards became a habit<br>affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of<br>being occupied with serious matters. In winter, except for business<br>excursions, he spent most of his time at home making himself one with<br>his family and entering into all the details of his children’s relations<br>with their mother. The harmony between him and his wife grew closer and<br>closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her.<br><br>From the time of his marriage Sónya had lived in his house. Before<br>that, Nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and<br>Sónya, blaming himself and commending her. He had asked Princess Mary to<br>be gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly realized the wrong he<br>had done Sónya, felt herself to blame toward her, and imagined that her<br>wealth had influenced Nicholas’ choice. She could not find fault with<br>Sónya in any way and tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill-will<br>toward her which she could not overcome.<br><br>Once she had a talk with her friend Natásha about Sónya and about her<br>own injustice toward her.<br><br>“You know,” said Natásha, “you have read the Gospels a great deal—there<br>is a passage in them that just fits Sónya.”<br><br>“What?” asked Countess Mary, surprised.<br><br>“‘To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be<br>taken away.’ You remember? She is one that hath not; why, I don’t know.<br>Perhaps she lacks egotism, I don’t know, but from her is taken away, and<br>everything has been taken away. Sometimes I am dreadfully sorry for her.<br>Formerly I very much wanted Nicholas to marry her, but I always had<br>a sort of presentiment that it would not come off. She is a sterile<br>flower, you know—like some strawberry blossoms. Sometimes I am sorry for<br>her, and sometimes I think she doesn’t feel it as you or I would.”<br><br>Though Countess Mary told Natásha that those words in the Gospel must be<br>understood differently, yet looking at Sónya she agreed with Natásha’s<br>explanation. It really seemed that Sónya did not feel her position<br>trying, and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower.<br>She seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a<br>whole. Like a cat, she had attached herself not to the people but to the<br>home. She waited on the old countess, petted and spoiled the children,<br>was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift,<br>and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient<br>gratitude.<br><br>The country seat at Bald Hills had been rebuilt, though not on the same<br>scale as under the old prince.<br><br>The buildings, begun under straitened circumstances, were more than<br>simple. The immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood,<br>plastered only inside. It had bare deal floors and was furnished with<br>very simple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by their own<br>serf carpenters out of their own birchwood. The house was spacious<br>and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors. Whole<br>families of the Rostóvs’ and Bolkónskis’ relations sometimes came to<br>Bald Hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for<br>months. Besides that, four times a year, on the name days and birthdays<br>of the hosts, as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day<br>or two. The rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its<br>ordinary occupations, and its breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers,<br>provided out of the produce of the estate.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>It was the eve of St. Nicholas, the fifth of December, 1820. Natásha had<br>been staying at her brother’s with her husband and children since early<br>autumn. Pierre had gone to Petersburg on business of his own for three<br>weeks as he said, but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was<br>expected back every minute.<br><br>Besides the Bezúkhov family, Nicholas’ old friend the retired General<br>Vasíli Dmítrich Denísov was staying with the Rostóvs this fifth of<br>December.<br><br>On the sixth, which was his name day when the house would be full of<br>visitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for<br>a tail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointed toes, and drive to<br>the new church he had built, and then receive visitors who would come to<br>congratulate him, offer them refreshments, and talk about the elections<br>of the nobility; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve<br>of that day in his usual way. He examined the bailiff’s accounts of<br>the village in Ryazán which belonged to his wife’s nephew, wrote two<br>business letters, and walked over to the granaries, cattle yards and<br>stables before dinner. Having taken precautions against the general<br>drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saint’s<br>day, he returned to dinner, and without having time for a private talk<br>with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons, at<br>which the whole household had assembled. At that table were his mother,<br>his mother’s old lady companion Belóva, his wife, their three children<br>with their governess and tutor, his wife’s nephew with his tutor, Sónya,<br>Denísov, Natásha, her three children, their governess, and old Michael<br>Ivánovich, the late prince’s architect, who was living on in retirement<br>at Bald Hills.<br><br>Countess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her husband took<br>his place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after taking<br>up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing<br>before him, that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the case when<br>he came in to dinner straight from the farm—especially before the soup.<br>Countess Mary well knew that mood of his, and when she herself was in<br>a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then<br>began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his<br>ill-humor. But today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should<br>be angry with her without any reason, and she felt unhappy. She asked<br>him where he had been. He replied. She again inquired whether<br>everything was going well on the farm. Her unnatural tone made him wince<br>unpleasantly and he replied hastily.<br><br>“Then I’m not mistaken,” thought Countess Mary. “Why is he cross with<br>me?” She concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished<br>to end the conversation. She knew her remarks sounded unnatural, but<br>could not refrain from asking some more questions.<br><br>Thanks to Denísov the conversation at table soon became general and<br>lively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left the table<br>and went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary held out her<br>hand and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was angry with her.<br><br>“You always have such strange fancies! I didn’t even think of being<br>angry,” he replied.<br><br>But the word always seemed to her to imply: “Yes, I am angry but I won’t<br>tell you why.”<br><br>Nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even Sónya and the<br>old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree,<br>could find nothing to reproach them with; but even they had their<br>moments of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just after they<br>had been happiest together, they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement<br>and hostility, which occurred most frequently during Countess Mary’s<br>pregnancies, and this was such a time.<br><br>“Well, messieurs et mesdames,” said Nicholas loudly and with apparent<br>cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to<br>vex her), “I have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorrow I<br>shall have to suffer, so today I’ll go and rest.”<br><br>And without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and<br>lay down on the sofa.<br><br>“That’s always the way,” thought Countess Mary. “He talks to everyone<br>except me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially when I<br>am in this condition.” She looked down at her expanded figure and in the<br>glass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes now looked<br>larger than ever.<br><br>And everything annoyed her—Denísov’s shouting and laughter, Natásha’s<br>talk, and especially a quick glance Sónya gave her.<br><br>Sónya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feeling<br>irritated.<br><br>Having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of<br>what they were saying, she softly left the room and went to the nursery.<br><br>The children were playing at “going to Moscow” in a carriage made of<br>chairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down and played with<br>them a little, but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable<br>crossness worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with<br>difficulty, went to the small sitting room.<br><br>“Perhaps he is not asleep; I’ll have an explanation with him,” she<br>said to herself. Little Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his mother,<br>followed her on tiptoe. She did not notice him.<br><br>“Mary, dear, I think he is asleep—he was so tired,” said Sónya, meeting<br>her in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that she<br>crossed her path everywhere). “Andrew may wake him.”<br><br>Countess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt that<br>Sónya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with evident<br>difficulty refrained from saying something harsh. She made no reply, but<br>to avoid obeying Sónya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quietly and went<br>to the door. Sónya went away by another door. From the room in which<br>Nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing, every<br>slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife. As she listened to it<br>she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his<br>whole face, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night<br>when he slept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. And at<br>that moment little Andrew shouted from outside the door: “Papa! Mamma’s<br>standing here!” Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs<br>to the boy. He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to<br>Countess Mary. She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through<br>the door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and<br>his voice said crossly:<br><br>“I can’t get a moment’s peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you bring<br>him here?”<br><br>“I only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me....”<br><br>Nicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the<br>door and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little<br>black-eyed three-year-old Natásha, her father’s pet, having learned from<br>her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran<br>to her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly<br>opened the creaking door, went up to the sofa with energetic steps of<br>her sturdy little legs, and having examined the position of her father,<br>who was asleep with his back to her, rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand<br>which lay under his head. Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his<br>face.<br><br>“Natásha, Natásha!” came Countess Mary’s frightened whisper from the<br>door. “Papa wants to sleep.”<br><br>“No, Mamma, he doesn’t want to sleep,” said little Natásha with<br>conviction. “He’s laughing.”<br><br>Nicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in his arms.<br><br>“Come in, Mary,” he said to his wife.<br><br>She went in and sat down by her husband.<br><br>“I did not notice him following me,” she said timidly. “I just looked<br>in.”<br><br>Holding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glanced at his wife and,<br>seeing her guilty expression, put his other arm around her and kissed<br>her hair.<br><br>“May I kiss Mamma?” he asked Natásha.<br><br>Natásha smiled bashfully.<br><br>“Again!” she commanded, pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot<br>where Nicholas had placed the kiss.<br><br>“I don’t know why you think I am cross,” said Nicholas, replying to the<br>question he knew was in his wife’s mind.<br><br>“You have no idea how unhappy, how lonely, I feel when you are like<br>that. It always seems to me...”<br><br>“Mary, don’t talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!” he<br>said gaily.<br><br>“It seems to be that you can’t love me, that I am so plain... always...<br>and now... in this cond...”<br><br>“Oh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, it’s love that<br>makes us see beauty. It is only Malvínas and women of that kind who are<br>loved for their beauty. But do I love my wife? I don’t love her, but...<br>I don’t know how to put it. Without you, or when something comes between<br>us like this, I seem lost and can’t do anything. Now do I love my<br>finger? I don’t love it, but just try to cut it off!”<br><br>“I’m not like that myself, but I understand. So you’re not angry with<br>me?”<br><br>“Awfully angry!” he said, smiling and getting up. And smoothing his hair<br>he began to pace the room.<br><br>“Do you know, Mary, what I’ve been thinking?” he began, immediately<br>thinking aloud in his wife’s presence now that they had made it up.<br><br>He did not ask if she was ready to listen to him. He did not care. A<br>thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also. And he told<br>her of his intention to persuade Pierre to stay with them till spring.<br><br>Countess Mary listened till he had finished, made some remark, and in<br>her turn began thinking aloud. Her thoughts were about the children.<br><br>“You can see the woman in her already,” she said in French, pointing to<br>little Natásha. “You reproach us women with being illogical. Here is our<br>logic. I say: ‘Papa wants to sleep!’ but she says, ‘No, he’s laughing.’<br>And she was right,” said Countess Mary with a happy smile.<br><br>“Yes, yes.” And Nicholas, taking his little daughter in his strong hand,<br>lifted her high, placed her on his shoulder, held her by the legs, and<br>paced the room with her. There was an expression of carefree happiness<br>on the faces of both father and daughter.<br><br>“But you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of this one,” his wife<br>whispered in French.<br><br>“Yes, but what am I to do?... I try not to show...”<br><br>At that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in<br>the hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.<br><br>“Somebody has come.”<br><br>“I am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see,” said Countess Mary and left<br>the room.<br><br>In her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a<br>gallop round the room. Out of breath, he took the laughing child quickly<br>from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart. His capers reminded<br>him of dancing, and looking at the child’s round happy little face he<br>thought of what she would be like when he was an old man, taking her<br>into society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had<br>danced Daniel Cooper with his daughter.<br><br>“It is he, it is he, Nicholas!” said Countess Mary, re-entering the room<br>a few minutes later. “Now our Natásha has come to life. You should have<br>seen her ecstasy, and how he caught it for having stayed away so long.<br>Well, come along now, quick, quick! It’s time you two were parted,” she<br>added, looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father.<br><br>Nicholas went out holding the child by the hand.<br><br>Countess Mary remained in the sitting room.<br><br>“I should never, never have believed that one could be so happy,” she<br>whispered to herself. A smile lit up her face but at the same time she<br>sighed, and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she<br>felt, through her happiness, that there is another sort of happiness<br>unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that<br>instant.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>Natásha had married in the early spring of 1813, and in 1820 already had<br>three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was<br>now nursing. She had grown stouter and broader, so that it was difficult<br>to recognize in this robust, motherly woman the slim, lively Natásha of<br>former days. Her features were more defined and had a calm, soft,<br>and serene expression. In her face there was none of the ever-glowing<br>animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm.<br>Now her face and body were often all that one saw, and her soul was<br>not visible at all. All that struck the eye was a strong, handsome, and<br>fertile woman. The old fire very rarely kindled in her face now. That<br>happened only when, as was the case that day, her husband returned home,<br>or a sick child was convalescent, or when she and Countess Mary spoke of<br>Prince Andrew (she never mentioned him to her husband, who she imagined<br>was jealous of Prince Andrew’s memory), or on the rare occasions when<br>something happened to induce her to sing, a practice she had quite<br>abandoned since her marriage. At the rare moments when the old fire<br>did kindle in her handsome, fully developed body she was even more<br>attractive than in former days.<br><br>Since their marriage Natásha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in<br>Petersburg, on their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, that is to<br>say, in Nicholas’ house. The young Countess Bezúkhova was not often seen<br>in society, and those who met her there were not pleased with her<br>and found her neither attractive nor amiable. Not that Natásha liked<br>solitude—she did not know whether she liked it or not, she even thought<br>that she did not—but with her pregnancies, her confinements, the nursing<br>of her children, and sharing every moment of her husband’s life, she had<br>demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society.<br>All who had known Natásha before her marriage wondered at the change<br>in her as at something extraordinary. Only the old countess with her<br>maternal instinct had realized that all Natásha’s outbursts had been due<br>to her need of children and a husband—as she herself had once exclaimed<br>at Otrádnoe not so much in fun as in earnest—and her mother was now<br>surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood<br>Natásha, and she kept saying that she had always known that Natásha<br>would make an exemplary wife and mother.<br><br>“Only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all<br>bounds,” said the countess, “so that it even becomes absurd.”<br><br>Natásha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk,<br>especially by the French, which says that a girl should not let herself<br>go when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments, should be<br>even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried, and<br>should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her<br>husband. Natásha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery,<br>of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part. She gave it up<br>just because it was so powerfully seductive. She took no pains with<br>her manners or with delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or to show<br>herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes, or to avoid<br>inconveniencing him by being too exacting. She acted in contradiction<br>to all those rules. She felt that the allurements instinct had formerly<br>taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of<br>her husband, to whom she had from the first moment given herself up<br>entirely—that is, with her whole soul, leaving no corner of it hidden<br>from him. She felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained<br>by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her, but by something<br>else—indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul.<br><br>To fluff out her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing romantic<br>songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn<br>herself to attract herself. To adorn herself for others might perhaps<br>have been agreeable—she did not know—but she had no time at all for it.<br>The chief reason for devoting no time either to singing, to dress, or<br>to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these<br>things.<br><br>We know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in<br>a subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so<br>trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one’s entire<br>attention is devoted to it.<br><br>The subject which wholly engrossed Natásha’s attention was her family:<br>that is, her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong<br>entirely to her and to the home, and the children whom she had to bear,<br>bring into the world, nurse, and bring up.<br><br>And the deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her whole<br>soul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the larger<br>did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers<br>appear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet<br>was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary.<br><br>There were then as now conversations and discussions about women’s<br>rights, the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights,<br>though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now; but<br>these topics were not merely uninteresting to Natásha, she positively<br>did not understand them.<br><br>These questions, then as now, existed only for those who see nothing in<br>marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another, that is,<br>only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance, which<br>lies in the family.<br><br>Discussions and questions of that kind, which are like the question of<br>how to get the greatest gratification from one’s dinner, did not then<br>and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the<br>nourishment it affords; and the purpose of marriage is the family.<br><br>If the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body, a man who eats two<br>dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his<br>purpose, for his stomach will not digest the two dinners.<br><br>If the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who wishes to have<br>many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but in that<br>case will not have a family.<br><br>If the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the<br>family, the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one<br>can digest, and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for<br>the family—that is, one wife or one husband. Natásha needed a husband. A<br>husband was given her and he gave her a family. And she not only saw no<br>need of any other or better husband, but as all the powers of her soul<br>were intent on serving that husband and family, she could not imagine<br>and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were<br>different.<br><br>Natásha did not care for society in general, but prized the more the<br>society of her relatives—Countess Mary, and her brother, her mother, and<br>Sónya. She valued the company of those to whom she could come striding<br>disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, and with joyful face<br>show a yellow instead of a green stain on baby’s napkin, and from whom<br>she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better.<br><br>To such an extent had Natásha let herself go that the way she dressed<br>and did her hair, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousy—she was jealous<br>of Sónya, of the governess, and of every woman, pretty or plain—were<br>habitual subjects of jest to those about her. The general opinion was<br>that Pierre was under his wife’s thumb, which was really true. From the<br>very first days of their married life Natásha had announced her demands.<br>Pierre was greatly surprised by his wife’s view, to him a perfectly<br>novel one, that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the<br>family. His wife’s demands astonished him, but they also flattered him,<br>and he submitted to them.<br><br>Pierre’s subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not<br>flirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman; did<br>not dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money on a<br>whim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time, except on<br>business—in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits, which<br>she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great<br>importance. To make up for this, at home Pierre had the right to<br>regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose. At<br>home Natásha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband,<br>and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied—that is, was<br>reading or writing in his study. Pierre had but to show a partiality for<br>anything to get just what he liked done always. He had only to express a<br>wish and Natásha would jump up and run to fulfill it.<br><br>The entire household was governed according to Pierre’s supposed orders,<br>that is, by his wishes which Natásha tried to guess. Their way of<br>life and place of residence, their acquaintances and ties, Natásha’s<br>occupations, the children’s upbringing, were all selected not merely<br>with regard to Pierre’s expressed wishes, but to what Natásha from the<br>thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be. And she<br>deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly, and having once<br>arrived at them clung to them tenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to<br>change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons.<br><br>Thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their<br>first child who was delicate, when they had to change the wet nurse<br>three times and Natásha fell ill from despair, Pierre one day told her<br>of Rousseau’s view, with which he quite agreed, that to have a wet<br>nurse is unnatural and harmful. When her next baby was born, despite<br>the opposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her husband<br>himself—who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself,<br>a thing then unheard of and considered injurious—she insisted on having<br>her own way, and after that nursed all her babies herself.<br><br>It very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife<br>would have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his surprise and<br>delight would find in his wife’s ideas and actions the very thought<br>against which she had argued, but divested of everything superfluous<br>that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his<br>opinion.<br><br>After seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm<br>consciousness that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because he saw<br>himself reflected in his wife. He felt the good and bad within himself<br>inextricably mingled and overlapping. But only what was really good in<br>him was reflected in his wife, all that was not quite good was rejected.<br>And this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and<br>mysterious reflection.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>Two months previously when Pierre was already staying with the Rostóvs<br>he had received a letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to come<br>to Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being<br>discussed there by a society of which Pierre was one of the principal<br>founders.<br><br>On reading that letter (she always read her husband’s letters) Natásha<br>herself suggested that he should go to Petersburg, though she would feel<br>his absence very acutely. She attributed immense importance to all<br>her husband’s intellectual and abstract interests though she did not<br>understand them, and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such<br>matters. To Pierre’s timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she<br>replied by asking him to go, but to fix a definite date for his return.<br>He was given four weeks’ leave of absence.<br><br>Ever since that leave of absence had expired, more than a fortnight<br>before, Natásha had been in a constant state of alarm, depression, and<br>irritability.<br><br>Denísov, now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with<br>the present state of affairs, had arrived during that fortnight. He<br>looked at Natásha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a<br>person once dear. A dull, dejected look, random replies, and talk about<br>the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress.<br><br>Natásha was sad and irritable all that time, especially when her mother,<br>her brother, Sónya, or Countess Mary in their efforts to console her<br>tried to excuse Pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning.<br><br>“It’s all nonsense, all rubbish—those discussions which lead to nothing<br>and all those idiotic societies!” Natásha declared of the very affairs<br>in the immense importance of which she firmly believed.<br><br>And she would go to the nursery to nurse Pétya, her only boy. No one<br>else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this<br>little three-month-old creature when he lay at her breast and she was<br>conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little<br>nose. That creature said: “You are angry, you are jealous, you would<br>like to pay him out, you are afraid—but here am I! And I am he...” and<br>that was unanswerable. It was more than true.<br><br>During that fortnight of anxiety Natásha resorted to the baby for<br>comfort so often, and fussed over him so much, that she overfed him and<br>he fell ill. She was terrified by his illness, and yet that was just<br>what she needed. While attending to him she bore the anxiety about her<br>husband more easily.<br><br>She was nursing her boy when the sound of Pierre’s sleigh was heard<br>at the front door, and the old nurse—knowing how to please her<br>mistress—entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming<br>face.<br><br>“Has he come?” Natásha asked quickly in a whisper, afraid to move lest<br>she should rouse the dozing baby.<br><br>“He’s come, ma’am,” whispered the nurse.<br><br>The blood rushed to Natásha’s face and her feet involuntarily moved, but<br>she could not jump up and run out. The baby again opened his eyes and<br>looked at her. “You’re here?” he seemed to be saying, and again lazily<br>smacked his lips.<br><br>Cautiously withdrawing her breast, Natásha rocked him a little, handed<br>him to the nurse, and went with rapid steps toward the door. But at the<br>door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in<br>her joy left the child too soon, and she glanced round. The nurse with<br>raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot.<br><br>“Go, ma’am! Don’t worry, go!” she whispered, smiling, with the kind of<br>familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress.<br><br>Natásha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom.<br><br>Denísov, who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his<br>pipe, now for the first time recognized the old Natásha. A flood of<br>brilliant, joyful light poured from her transfigured face.<br><br>“He’s come!” she exclaimed as she ran past, and Denísov felt that he too<br>was delighted that Pierre, whom he did not much care for, had returned.<br><br>On reaching the vestibule Natásha saw a tall figure in a fur coat<br>unwinding his scarf. “It’s he! It’s really he! He has come!” she said<br>to herself, and rushing at him embraced him, pressed his head to her<br>breast, and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy, happy face,<br>covered with hoarfrost. “Yes, it is he, happy and contented....”<br><br>Then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had<br>experienced for the last fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her<br>face vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed Pierre with a torrent of<br>reproaches and angry words.<br><br>“Yes, it’s all very well for you. You are pleased, you’ve had a good<br>time.... But what about me? You might at least have shown consideration<br>for the children. I am nursing and my milk was spoiled.... Pétya was at<br>death’s door. But you were enjoying yourself. Yes, enjoying...”<br><br>Pierre knew he was not to blame, for he could not have come sooner; he<br>knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two;<br>above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy. He wanted<br>to smile but dared not even think of doing so. He made a piteous,<br>frightened face and bent down.<br><br>“I could not, on my honor. But how is Pétya?”<br><br>“All right now. Come along! I wonder you’re not ashamed! If only you<br>could see what I was like without you, how I suffered!”<br><br>“You are well?”<br><br>“Come, come!” she said, not letting go of his arm. And they went to<br>their rooms.<br><br>When Nicholas and his wife came to look for Pierre he was in the nursery<br>holding his baby son, who was again awake, on his huge right palm and<br>dandling him. A blissful bright smile was fixed on the baby’s broad face<br>with its toothless open mouth. The storm was long since over and there<br>was bright, joyous sunshine on Natásha’s face as she gazed tenderly at<br>her husband and child.<br><br>“And have you talked everything well over with Prince Theodore?” she<br>asked.<br><br>“Yes, capitally.”<br><br>“You see, he holds it up.” (She meant the baby’s head.) “But how he did<br>frighten me... You’ve seen the princess? Is it true she’s in love with<br>that...”<br><br>“Yes, just fancy...”<br><br>At that moment Nicholas and Countess Mary came in. Pierre with the baby<br>on his hand stooped, kissed them, and replied to their inquiries. But<br>in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed, the baby<br>with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his<br>attention.<br><br>“How sweet!” said Countess Mary, looking at and playing with the baby.<br>“Now, Nicholas,” she added, turning to her husband, “I can’t understand<br>how it is you don’t see the charm of these delicious marvels.”<br><br>“I don’t and can’t,” replied Nicholas, looking coldly at the baby. “A<br>lump of flesh. Come along, Pierre!”<br><br>“And yet he’s such an affectionate father,” said Countess Mary,<br>vindicating her husband, “but only after they are a year old or so...”<br><br>“Now, Pierre nurses them splendidly,” said Natásha. “He says his hand is<br>just made for a baby’s seat. Just look!”<br><br>“Only not for this...” Pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh, and<br>shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>As in every large household, there were at Bald Hills several perfectly<br>distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole, though each<br>retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others. Every<br>event, joyful or sad, that took place in that house was important to all<br>these worlds, but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve<br>over that occurrence independently of the others.<br><br>For instance, Pierre’s return was a joyful and important event and they<br>all felt it to be so.<br><br>The servants—the most reliable judges of their masters because they<br>judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their<br>acts and way of life—were glad of Pierre’s return because they knew that<br>when he was there Count Nicholas would cease going every day to attend<br>to the estate, and would be in better spirits and temper, and also<br>because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays.<br><br>The children and their governesses were glad of Pierre’s return because<br>no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did.<br>He alone could play on the clavichord that écossaise (his only piece)<br>to which, as he said, all possible dances could be danced, and they felt<br>sure he had brought presents for them all.<br><br>Young Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, delicate and intelligent,<br>with curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted because<br>Uncle Pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and<br>passionate affection. No one had instilled into him this love for Pierre<br>whom he saw only occasionally. Countess Mary who had brought him up<br>had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him, and<br>little Nicholas did love his uncle, but loved him with just a shade of<br>contempt. Pierre, however, he adored. He did not want to be an hussar or<br>a Knight of St. George like his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learned,<br>wise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierre’s presence his face always shone<br>with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when Pierre spoke to<br>him. He did not miss a single word he uttered, and would afterwards,<br>with Dessalles or by himself, recall and reconsider the meaning of<br>everything Pierre had said. Pierre’s past life and his unhappiness prior<br>to 1812 (of which young Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from<br>some words he had overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity,<br>Platón Karatáev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for Natásha<br>(of whom the lad was also particularly fond), and especially Pierre’s<br>friendship with the father whom Nicholas could not remember—all this<br>made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint.<br><br>From broken remarks about Natásha and his father, from the emotion with<br>which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, reverent<br>tenderness with which Natásha spoke of him, the boy, who was only just<br>beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had<br>loved Natásha and when dying had left her to his friend. But the father<br>whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not<br>be pictured, and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and<br>tears of sadness and rapture. So the boy also was happy that Pierre had<br>arrived.<br><br>The guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite<br>any company he was in.<br><br>The grown-up members of the family, not to mention his wife, were<br>pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly<br>and peacefully.<br><br>The old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them, and<br>especially that Natásha would now be herself again.<br><br>Pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made<br>haste to satisfy all their expectations.<br><br>Though the most absent-minded and forgetful of men, Pierre, with the aid<br>of a list his wife drew up, had now bought everything, not forgetting<br>his mother—and brother-in-law’s commissions, nor the dress material for<br>a present to Belóva, nor toys for his wife’s nephews. In the early days<br>of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect<br>him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy, and he<br>had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he<br>forgot everything. But in time he grew used to this demand. Knowing that<br>Natásha asked nothing for herself, and gave him commissions for others<br>only when he himself had offered to undertake them, he now found an<br>unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for<br>everyone in the house, and never forgot anything. If he now incurred<br>Natásha’s censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive<br>things. To her other defects (as most people thought them, but which<br>to Pierre were qualities) of untidiness and neglect of herself, she now<br>added stinginess.<br><br>From the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing<br>entailing heavy expenditure, he had noticed to his surprise that he<br>spent only half as much as before, and that his affairs—which had been<br>in disorder of late, chiefly because of his first wife’s debts—had begun<br>to improve.<br><br>Life was cheaper because it was circumscribed: that most expensive<br>luxury, the kind of life that can be changed at any moment, was no<br>longer his nor did he wish for it. He felt that his way of life had now<br>been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in<br>his power, and so that way of life proved economical.<br><br>With a merry, smiling face Pierre was sorting his purchases.<br><br>“What do you think of this?” said he, unrolling a piece of stuff like a<br>shopman.<br><br>Natásha, who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her<br>lap, turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he<br>showed her.<br><br>“That’s for Belóva? Excellent!” She felt the quality of the material.<br>“It was a ruble an arshin, I suppose?”<br><br>Pierre told her the price.<br><br>“Too dear!” Natásha remarked. “How pleased the children will be and<br>Mamma too! Only you need not have bought me this,” she added, unable to<br>suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls,<br>of a kind then just coming into fashion.<br><br>“Adèle tempted me: she kept on telling me to buy it,” returned Pierre.<br><br>“When am I to wear it?” and Natásha stuck it in her coil of hair. “When<br>I take little Másha into society? Perhaps they will be fashionable again<br>by then. Well, let’s go now.”<br><br>And collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to<br>the old countess’ rooms.<br><br>The countess was sitting with her companion Belóva, playing<br>grand-patience as usual, when Pierre and Natásha came into the drawing<br>room with parcels under their arms.<br><br>The countess was now over sixty, was quite gray, and wore a cap with a<br>frill that surrounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her upper lip<br>had sunk in, and her eyes were dim.<br><br>After the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession, she<br>felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left<br>without aim or object for her existence. She ate, drank, slept, or kept<br>awake, but did not live. Life gave her no new impressions. She wanted<br>nothing from life but tranquillity, and that tranquillity only death<br>could give her. But until death came she had to go on living, that is,<br>to use her vital forces. A peculiarity one sees in very young children<br>and very old people was particularly evident in her. Her life had<br>no external aims—only a need to exercise her various functions and<br>inclinations was apparent. She had to eat, sleep, think, speak, weep,<br>work, give vent to her anger, and so on, merely because she had a<br>stomach, a brain, muscles, nerves, and a liver. She did these things not<br>under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do,<br>when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their<br>functions remains unnoticed. She talked only because she physically<br>needed to exercise her tongue and lungs. She cried as a child does,<br>because her nose had to be cleared, and so on. What for people in their<br>full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext.<br><br>Thus in the morning—especially if she had eaten anything rich the day<br>before—she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest<br>pretext Belóva’s deafness.<br><br>She would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end<br>of the room.<br><br>“It seems a little warmer today, my dear,” she would murmur.<br><br>And when Belóva replied: “Oh yes, they’ve come,” she would mutter<br>angrily: “O Lord! How stupid and deaf she is!”<br><br>Another pretext would be her snuff, which would seem too dry or too damp<br>or not rubbed fine enough. After these fits of irritability her face<br>would grow yellow, and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when Belóva<br>would again be deaf, the snuff damp, and the countess’ face yellow. Just<br>as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise<br>her still-existing faculty of thinking—and the pretext for that was a<br>game of patience. When she needed to cry, the deceased count would be<br>the pretext. When she wanted to be agitated, Nicholas and his health<br>would be the pretext, and when she felt a need to speak spitefully, the<br>pretext would be Countess Mary. When her vocal organs needed exercise,<br>which was usually toward seven o’clock when she had had an after-dinner<br>rest in a darkened room, the pretext would be the retelling of the same<br>stories over and over again to the same audience.<br><br>The old lady’s condition was understood by the whole household though no<br>one ever spoke of it, and they all made every possible effort to satisfy<br>her needs. Only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile<br>between Nicholas, Pierre, Natásha, and Countess Mary was the common<br>understanding of her condition expressed.<br><br>But those glances expressed something more: they said that she had<br>played her part in life, that what they now saw was not her whole self,<br>that we must all become like her, and that they were glad to yield to<br>her, to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as<br>full of life as themselves, but now so much to be pitied. “Memento<br>mori,” said these glances.<br><br>Only the really heartless, the stupid ones of that household, and the<br>little children failed to understand this and avoided her.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIII<br><br>When Pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in<br>one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of<br>playing patience, and so—though by force of habit she greeted him with<br>the words she always used when Pierre or her son returned after an<br>absence: “High time, my dear, high time! We were all weary of waiting<br>for you. Well, thank God!” and received her presents with another<br>customary remark: “It’s not the gift that’s precious, my dear, but that<br>you give it to me, an old woman...”—yet it was evident that she was<br>not pleased by Pierre’s arrival at that moment when it diverted her<br>attention from the unfinished game.<br><br>She finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents.<br>They consisted of a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, a<br>bright-blue Sèvres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with<br>a lid, and a gold snuffbox with the count’s portrait on the lid which<br>Pierre had had done by a miniaturist in Petersburg. The countess had<br>long wished for such a box, but as she did not want to cry just then she<br>glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to<br>the box for cards.<br><br>“Thank you, my dear, you have cheered me up,” said she as she always<br>did. “But best of all you have brought yourself back—for I never saw<br>anything like it, you ought to give your wife a scolding! What are we<br>to do with her? She is like a mad woman when you are away. Doesn’t see<br>anything, doesn’t remember anything,” she went on, repeating her usual<br>phrases. “Look, Anna Timoféevna,” she added to her companion, “see what<br>a box for cards my son has brought us!”<br><br>Belóva admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material.<br><br>Though Pierre, Natásha, Nicholas, Countess Mary, and Denísov had much to<br>talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess—not<br>that anything was hidden from her, but because she had dropped so<br>far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her<br>presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to<br>repeat what they had already told her many times: that so-and-so was<br>dead and so-and-so was married, which she would again be unable to<br>remember—yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from<br>habit, and Pierre answered the countess’ questions as to whether Prince<br>Vasíli had aged and whether Countess Mary Alexéevna had sent greetings<br>and still thought of them, and other matters that interested no one and<br>to which she herself was indifferent.<br><br>Conversation of this kind, interesting to no one yet unavoidable,<br>continued all through teatime. All the grown-up members of the family<br>were assembled near the round tea table at which Sónya presided beside<br>the samovar. The children with their tutors and governesses had had<br>tea and their voices were audible from the next room. At tea all sat<br>in their accustomed places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small table<br>where his tea was handed to him; Mílka, the old gray borzoi bitch<br>(daughter of the first Mílka), with a quite gray face and large black<br>eyes that seemed more prominent than ever, lay on the armchair beside<br>him; Denísov, whose curly hair, mustache, and whiskers had turned half<br>gray, sat beside countess Mary with his general’s tunic unbuttoned;<br>Pierre sat between his wife and the old countess. He spoke of what he<br>knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand. He<br>told her of external social events and of the people who had formed<br>the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real, living, and<br>distinct group, but who were now for the most part scattered about the<br>world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they<br>had sown in earlier years. But to the old countess those contemporaries<br>of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society. Natásha saw by<br>Pierre’s animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had<br>much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess. Denísov,<br>not being a member of the family, did not understand Pierre’s caution<br>and being, as a malcontent, much interested in what was occurring in<br>Petersburg, kept urging Pierre to tell them about what had happened in<br>the Semënovsk regiment, then about Arakchéev, and then about the Bible<br>Society. Once or twice Pierre was carried away and began to speak of<br>these things, but Nicholas and Natásha always brought him back to the<br>health of Prince Iván and Countess Mary Alexéevna.<br><br>“Well, and all this idiocy—Gossner and Tatáwinova?” Denísov asked. “Is<br>that weally still going on?”<br><br>“Going on?” Pierre exclaimed. “Why more than ever! The Bible Society is<br>the whole government now!”<br><br>“What is that, mon cher ami?” asked the countess, who had finished her<br>tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal. “What<br>are you saying about the government? I don’t understand.”<br><br>“Well, you know, Maman,” Nicholas interposed, knowing how to translate<br>things into his mother’s language, “Prince Alexander Golítsyn has<br>founded a society and in consequence has great influence, they say.”<br><br>“Arakchéev and Golítsyn,” incautiously remarked Pierre, “are now the<br>whole government! And what a government! They see treason everywhere and<br>are afraid of everything.”<br><br>“Well, and how is Prince Alexander to blame? He is a most estimable<br>man. I used to meet him at Mary Antónovna’s,” said the countess in an<br>offended tone; and still more offended that they all remained silent,<br>she went on: “Nowadays everyone finds fault. A Gospel Society! Well, and<br>what harm is there in that?” and she rose (everybody else got up too)<br>and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting<br>room.<br><br>The melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the<br>children’s voices and laughter from the next room. Evidently some jolly<br>excitement was going on there.<br><br>“Finished, finished!” little Natásha’s gleeful yell rose above them all.<br><br>Pierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (Natásha he<br>never lost sight of) and smiled happily.<br><br>“That’s delightful music!” said he.<br><br>“It means that Anna Makárovna has finished her stocking,” said Countess<br>Mary.<br><br>“Oh, I’ll go and see,” said Pierre, jumping up. “You know,” he added,<br>stopping at the door, “why I’m especially fond of that music? It is<br>always the first thing that tells me all is well. When I was driving<br>here today, the nearer I got to the house the more anxious I grew. As I<br>entered the anteroom I heard Andrúsha’s peals of laughter and that meant<br>that all was well.”<br><br>“I know! I know that feeling,” said Nicholas. “But I mustn’t go<br>there—those stockings are to be a surprise for me.”<br><br>Pierre went to the children, and the shouting and laughter grew still<br>louder.<br><br>“Come, Anna Makárovna,” Pierre’s voice was heard saying, “come here into<br>the middle of the room and at the word of command, ‘One, two,’ and<br>when I say ‘three’... You stand here, and you in my arms—well now! One,<br>two!...” said Pierre, and a silence followed: “three!” and a rapturously<br>breathless cry of children’s voices filled the room. “Two, two!” they<br>shouted.<br><br>This meant two stockings, which by a secret process known only to<br>herself Anna Makárovna used to knit at the same time on the same<br>needles, and which, when they were ready, she always triumphantly drew,<br>one out of the other, in the children’s presence.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XIV<br><br>Soon after this the children came in to say good night. They kissed<br>everyone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and they went out.<br>Only young Nicholas and his tutor remained. Dessalles whispered to the<br>boy to come downstairs.<br><br>“No, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me stay,” replied<br>Nicholas Bolkónski also in a whisper.<br><br>“Ma tante, please let me stay,” said he, going up to his aunt.<br><br>His face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy. Countess Mary<br>glanced at him and turned to Pierre.<br><br>“When you are here he can’t tear himself away,” she said.<br><br>“I will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles. Good night!”<br>said Pierre, giving his hand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned to young<br>Nicholas with a smile. “You and I haven’t seen anything of one another<br>yet.... How like he is growing, Mary!” he added, addressing Countess<br>Mary.<br><br>“Like my father?” asked the boy, flushing crimson and looking up at<br>Pierre with bright, ecstatic eyes.<br><br>Pierre nodded, and went on with what he had been saying when the<br>children had interrupted. Countess Mary sat down doing woolwork; Natásha<br>did not take her eyes off her husband. Nicholas and Denísov rose, asked<br>for their pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea from Sónya—who sat weary<br>but resolute at the samovar—and questioned Pierre. The curly-headed,<br>delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner, starting<br>every now and then and muttering something to himself, and evidently<br>experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head,<br>with his thin neck exposed by his turn-down collar, toward the place<br>where Pierre sat.<br><br>The conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power,<br>in which most people see the chief interest of home politics. Denísov,<br>dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments<br>in the service, heard with pleasure of the things done in Petersburg<br>which seemed to him stupid, and made forcible and sharp comments on what<br>Pierre told them.<br><br>“One used to have to be a German—now one must dance with Tatáwinova<br>and Madame Kwüdener, and wead Ecka’tshausen and the bwethwen. Oh, they<br>should let that fine fellow Bonaparte loose—he’d knock all this nonsense<br>out of them! Fancy giving the command of the Semënov wegiment to a<br>fellow like that Schwa’tz!” he cried.<br><br>Nicholas, though free from Denísov’s readiness to find fault with<br>everything, also thought that discussion of the government was a very<br>serious and weighty matter, and the fact that A had been appointed<br>Minister of This and B Governor General of That, and that the Emperor<br>had said so-and-so and this minister so-and-so, seemed to him very<br>important. And so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these<br>things and to question Pierre. The questions put by these two kept the<br>conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the<br>higher government circles.<br><br>But Natásha, knowing all her husband’s ways and ideas, saw that he had<br>long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to<br>another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of<br>which he had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend Prince<br>Theodore, and she helped him by asking how his affairs with Prince<br>Theodore had gone.<br><br>“What was it about?” asked Nicholas.<br><br>“Always the same thing,” said Pierre, looking round at his listeners.<br>“Everybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be<br>allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to<br>counteract it as far as they can.”<br><br>“What can decent men do?” Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly. “What<br>can be done?”<br><br>“Why, this...”<br><br>“Come into my study,” said Nicholas.<br><br>Natásha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby, now<br>heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary<br>followed her. The men went into the study and little Nicholas Bolkónski<br>followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table<br>in a shady corner by the window.<br><br>“Well, what would you do?” asked Denísov.<br><br>“Always some fantastic schemes,” said Nicholas.<br><br>“Why this,” began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room,<br>sometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: “the position<br>in Petersburg is this: the Emperor does not look into anything. He<br>has abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism” (Pierre could not<br>tolerate mysticism in anyone now). “He seeks only for peace, and only<br>these people sans foi ni loi * can give it him—people who recklessly<br>hack at and strangle everything—Magnítski, Arakchéev, and tutti<br>quanti.... You will agree that if you did not look after your estates<br>yourself but only wanted a quiet life, the harsher your steward was the<br>more readily your object might be attained,” he said to Nicholas.<br><br>    * Without faith or law.<br><br>“Well, what does that lead up to?” said Nicholas.<br><br>“Well, everything is going to ruin! Robbery in the law courts, in the<br>army nothing but flogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; the<br>people are tortured, enlightenment is suppressed. All that is young and<br>honest is crushed! Everyone sees that this cannot go on. Everything is<br>strained to such a degree that it will certainly break,” said Pierre (as<br>those who examine the actions of any government have always said since<br>governments began). “I told them just one thing in Petersburg.”<br><br>“Told whom?”<br><br>“Well, you know whom,” said Pierre, with a meaning glance from under<br>his brows. “Prince Theodore and all those. To encourage culture and<br>philanthropy is all very well of course. The aim is excellent but in the<br>present circumstances something else is needed.”<br><br>At that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew. His face<br>darkened and he went up to the boy.<br><br>“Why are you here?”<br><br>“Why? Let him be,” said Pierre, taking Nicholas by the arm and<br>continuing. “That is not enough, I told them. Something else is needed.<br>When you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment,<br>when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe, as many as<br>possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general<br>calamity. Everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and<br>depraved. One is lured by women, another by honors, a third by ambition<br>or money, and they go over to that camp. No independent men, such as you<br>or I, are left. What I say is widen the scope of our society, let the<br>mot d’ordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well!”<br><br>Nicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an armchair, sat<br>down in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly and frowning<br>more and more.<br><br>“But action with what aim?” he cried. “And what position will you adopt<br>toward the government?”<br><br>“Why, the position of assistants. The society need not be secret if the<br>government allows it. Not merely is it not hostile to government, but<br>it is a society of true conservatives—a society of gentlemen in the full<br>meaning of that word. It is only to prevent some Pugachëv or other from<br>killing my children and yours, and Arakchéev from sending me off to some<br>Military Settlement. We join hands only for the public welfare and the<br>general safety.”<br><br>“Yes, but it’s a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one<br>which can only cause harm.”<br><br>“Why? Did the Tugendbund which saved Europe” (they did not then venture<br>to suggest that Russia had saved Europe) “do any harm? The Tugendbund<br>is an alliance of virtue: it is love, mutual help... it is what Christ<br>preached on the Cross.”<br><br>Natásha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully at<br>her husband. It was not what he was saying that pleased her—that did not<br>even interest her, for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple<br>and that she had known it a long time (it seemed so to her because she<br>knew that it sprang from Pierre’s whole soul), but it was his animated<br>and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad.<br><br>The boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn-down collar—whom<br>everyone had forgotten—gazed at Pierre with even greater and more<br>rapturous joy. Every word of Pierre’s burned into his heart, and with a<br>nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax<br>and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncle’s table.<br><br>“It is not at all what you suppose; but that is what the German<br>Tugendbund was, and what I am proposing.”<br><br>“No, my fwiend! The Tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters,<br>but I don’t understand it and can’t even pwonounce it,” interposed<br>Denísov in a loud and resolute voice. “I agwee that evewything here is<br>wotten and howwible, but the Tugendbund I don’t understand. If we’re<br>not satisfied, let us have a bunt of our own. That’s all wight. Je suis<br>vot’e homme!” *<br><br>    * “I’m your man.”<br><br><br>Pierre smiled, Natásha began to laugh, but Nicholas knitted his brows<br>still more and began proving to Pierre that there was no prospect of<br>any great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his<br>imagination. Pierre maintained the contrary, and as his mental faculties<br>were greater and more resourceful, Nicholas felt himself cornered. This<br>made him still angrier, for he was fully convinced, not by reasoning<br>but by something within him stronger than reason, of the justice of his<br>opinion.<br><br>“I will tell you this,” he said, rising and trying with nervously<br>twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally<br>abandoning the attempt. “I can’t prove it to you. You say that<br>everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming: I don’t<br>see it. But you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional<br>matter, and to that I reply: ‘You are my best friend, as you know,<br>but if you formed a secret society and began working against the<br>government—be it what it may—I know it is my duty to obey the<br>government. And if Arakchéev ordered me to lead a squadron against you<br>and cut you down, I should not hesitate an instant, but should do it.’<br>And you may argue about that as you like!”<br><br>An awkward silence followed these words. Natásha was the first to speak,<br>defending her husband and attacking her brother. Her defense was weak<br>and inapt but she attained her object. The conversation was resumed, and<br>no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of Nicholas’ last remark.<br><br>When they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas Bolkónski went<br>up to Pierre, pale and with shining, radiant eyes.<br><br>“Uncle Pierre, you... no... If Papa were alive... would he agree with<br>you?” he asked.<br><br>And Pierre suddenly realized what a special, independent, complex, and<br>powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in<br>this boy during that conversation, and remembering all he had said he<br>regretted that the lad should have heard him. He had, however, to give<br>him an answer.<br><br>“Yes, I think so,” he said reluctantly, and left the study.<br><br>The lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he<br>had done to the things on the table. He flushed and went up to Nicholas.<br><br>“Uncle, forgive me, I did that... unintentionally,” he said, pointing to<br>the broken sealing wax and pens.<br><br>Nicholas started angrily.<br><br>“All right, all right,” he said, throwing the bits under the table.<br><br>And evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty, he turned away<br>from the boy.<br><br>“You ought not to have been here at all,” he said.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XV<br><br>The conversation at supper was not about politics or societies, but<br>turned on the subject Nicholas liked best—recollections of 1812. Denísov<br>started these and Pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about<br>them. The family separated on the most friendly terms.<br><br>After supper Nicholas, having undressed in his study and given<br>instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him, went to the<br>bedroom in his dressing gown, where he found his wife still at her<br>table, writing.<br><br>“What are you writing, Mary?” Nicholas asked.<br><br>Countess Mary blushed. She was afraid that what she was writing would<br>not be understood or approved by her husband.<br><br>She had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him, but at the same<br>time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to<br>tell him.<br><br>“A diary, Nicholas,” she replied, handing him a blue exercise book<br>filled with her firm, bold writing.<br><br>“A diary?” Nicholas repeated with a shade of irony, and he took up the<br>book.<br><br>It was in French.<br><br><br>December 4. Today when Andrúsha (her eldest boy) woke up he did not<br>wish to dress and Mademoiselle Louise sent for me. He was naughty and<br>obstinate. I tried threats, but he only grew angrier. Then I took the<br>matter in hand: I left him alone and began with nurse’s help to get the<br>other children up, telling him that I did not love him. For a long time<br>he was silent, as if astonished, then he jumped out of bed, ran to me in<br>his shirt, and sobbed so that I could not calm him for a long time.<br>It was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me.<br>Afterwards in the evening when I gave him his ticket, he again began<br>crying piteously and kissing me. One can do anything with him by<br>tenderness.<br><br><br>“What is a ‘ticket’?” Nicholas inquired.<br><br>“I have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening, showing how<br>they have behaved.”<br><br>Nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him, and<br>continued to turn over the pages and read. In the diary was set down<br>everything in the children’s lives that seemed noteworthy to their<br>mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections<br>on educational methods. They were for the most part quite insignificant<br>trifles, but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either, now<br>that he read this diary about his children for the first time.<br><br>Under the date “5” was entered:<br><br><br>Mítya was naughty at table. Papa said he was to have no pudding. He had<br>none, but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were<br>eating! I think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only<br>develops their greediness. Must tell Nicholas this.<br><br>Nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife. The radiant eyes<br>gazed at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove of her<br>diary? There could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his<br>admiration for his wife.<br><br>Perhaps it need not be done so pedantically, thought Nicholas, or even<br>done at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual effort of which the<br>sole aim was the children’s moral welfare delighted him. Had Nicholas<br>been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady,<br>tender, and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at<br>her spirituality and at the lofty moral world, almost beyond his reach,<br>in which she had her being.<br><br>He was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized his own<br>insignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the<br>more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of<br>himself.<br><br>“I quite, quite approve, my dearest!” said he with a significant look,<br>and after a short pause he added: “And I behaved badly today. You<br>weren’t in the study. We began disputing—Pierre and I—and I lost my<br>temper. But he is impossible: such a child! I don’t know what would<br>become of him if Natásha didn’t keep him in hand.... Have you any idea<br>why he went to Petersburg? They have formed...”<br><br>“Yes, I know,” said Countess Mary. “Natásha told me.”<br><br>“Well, then, you know,” Nicholas went on, growing hot at the mere<br>recollection of their discussion, “he wanted to convince me that it is<br>every honest man’s duty to go against the government, and that the oath<br>of allegiance and duty... I am sorry you weren’t there. They all fell on<br>me—Denísov and Natásha... Natásha is absurd. How she rules over him! And<br>yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own<br>but only repeats his sayings...” added Nicholas, yielding to that<br>irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and<br>dearest to us. He forgot that what he was saying about Natásha could<br>have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife.<br><br>“Yes, I have noticed that,” said Countess Mary.<br><br>“When I told him that duty and the oath were above everything, he<br>started proving goodness knows what! A pity you were not there—what<br>would you have said?”<br><br>“As I see it you were quite right, and I told Natásha so. Pierre says<br>everybody is suffering, tortured, and being corrupted, and that it<br>is our duty to help our neighbor. Of course he is right there,” said<br>Countess Mary, “but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us,<br>duties indicated to us by God Himself, and that though we might expose<br>ourselves to risks we must not risk our children.”<br><br>“Yes, that’s it! That’s just what I said to him,” put in Nicholas, who<br>fancied he really had said it. “But they insisted on their own view:<br>love of one’s neighbor and Christianity—and all this in the presence of<br>young Nicholas, who had gone into my study and broke all my things.”<br><br>“Ah, Nicholas, do you know I am often troubled about little Nicholas,”<br>said Countess Mary. “He is such an exceptional boy. I am afraid I<br>neglect him in favor of my own: we all have children and relations while<br>he has no one. He is constantly alone with his thoughts.”<br><br>“Well, I don’t think you need reproach yourself on his account. All that<br>the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for<br>him, and of course I am glad of it. He is a fine lad, a fine lad! This<br>evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and fancy—as we were<br>going in to supper I looked and he had broken everything on my table to<br>bits, and he told me of it himself at once! I never knew him to tell an<br>untruth. A fine lad, a fine lad!” repeated Nicholas, who at heart was<br>not fond of Nicholas Bolkónski but was always anxious to recognize that<br>he was a fine lad.<br><br>“Still, I am not the same as his own mother,” said Countess Mary. “I<br>feel I am not the same and it troubles me. A wonderful boy, but I am<br>dreadfully afraid for him. It would be good for him to have companions.”<br><br>“Well it won’t be for long. Next summer I’ll take him to Petersburg,”<br>said Nicholas. “Yes, Pierre always was a dreamer and always will be,”<br>he continued, returning to the talk in the study which had evidently<br>disturbed him. “Well, what business is it of mine what goes on<br>there—whether Arakchéev is bad, and all that? What business was it of<br>mine when I married and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with<br>prison, and had a mother who could not see or understand it? And<br>then there are you and the children and our affairs. Is it for my own<br>pleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night?<br>No, but I know I must work to comfort my mother, to repay you, and not<br>to leave the children such beggars as I was.”<br><br>Countess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone<br>and that he attached too much importance to these matters. But she knew<br>she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so. She only<br>took his hand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of approval and<br>a confirmation of his thoughts, and after a few minutes’ reflection<br>continued to think aloud.<br><br>“You know, Mary, today Elias Mitrofánych” (this was his overseer) “came<br>back from the Tambóv estate and told me they are already offering eighty<br>thousand rubles for the forest.”<br><br>And with an eager face Nicholas began to speak of the possibility of<br>repurchasing Otrádnoe before long, and added: “Another ten years of life<br>and I shall leave the children... in an excellent position.”<br><br>Countess Mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told<br>her. She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes<br>ask her what he had been saying, and be vexed if he noticed that she<br>had been thinking about something else. But she had to force herself to<br>attend, for what he was saying did not interest her at all. She looked<br>at him and did not think, but felt, about something different. She felt<br>a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all<br>that she understood, and this seemed to make her love for him still<br>stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness. Besides this<br>feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following<br>the details of her husband’s plans, thoughts that had no connection with<br>what he was saying flitted through her mind. She thought of her nephew.<br>Her husband’s account of the boy’s agitation while Pierre was speaking<br>struck her forcibly, and various traits of his gentle, sensitive<br>character recurred to her mind; and while thinking of her nephew she<br>thought also of her own children. She did not compare them with him, but<br>compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him, and felt<br>with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young<br>Nicholas.<br><br>Sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the<br>difference in their ages, but she felt herself to blame toward him and<br>promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible—in<br>this life to love her husband, her children, little Nicholas, and all<br>her neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. Countess Mary’s soul always<br>strove toward the infinite, the eternal, and the absolute, and could<br>therefore never be at peace. A stern expression of the lofty, secret<br>suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face. Nicholas<br>gazed at her. “O God! What will become of us if she dies, as I always<br>fear when her face is like that?” thought he, and placing himself before<br>the icon he began to say his evening prayers.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XVI<br><br>Natásha and Pierre, left alone, also began to talk as only a husband<br>and wife can talk, that is, with extraordinary clearness and rapidity,<br>understanding and expressing each other’s thoughts in ways contrary to<br>all rules of logic, without premises, deductions, or conclusions, and in<br>a quite peculiar way. Natásha was so used to this kind of talk with her<br>husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong<br>between them if Pierre followed a line of logical reasoning. When he<br>began proving anything, or talking argumentatively and calmly and she,<br>led on by his example, began to do the same, she knew that they were on<br>the verge of a quarrel.<br><br>From the moment they were alone and Natásha came up to him with<br>wide-open happy eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her<br>bosom, saying: “Now you are all mine, mine! You won’t escape!”—from that<br>moment this conversation began, contrary to all the laws of logic and<br>contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at<br>one and the same time. This simultaneous discussion of many topics did<br>not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest<br>sign that they fully understood one another.<br><br>Just as in a dream when all is uncertain, unreasoning, and<br>contradictory, except the feeling that guides the dream, so in this<br>intercourse contrary to all laws of reason, the words themselves were<br>not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them.<br><br>Natásha spoke to Pierre about her brother’s life and doings, of how she<br>had suffered and lacked life during his own absence, and of how she<br>was fonder than ever of Mary, and how Mary was in every way better than<br>herself. In saying this Natásha was sincere in acknowledging Mary’s<br>superiority, but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on<br>Pierre that he should, all the same, prefer her to Mary and to all<br>other women, and that now, especially after having seen many women in<br>Petersburg, he should tell her so afresh.<br><br>Pierre, answering Natásha’s words, told her how intolerable it had been<br>for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg.<br><br>“I have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies,” he said. “It was<br>simply dull. Besides, I was very busy.”<br><br>Natásha looked intently at him and went on:<br><br>“Mary is so splendid,” she said. “How she understands children! It is as<br>if she saw straight into their souls. Yesterday, for instance, Mítya was<br>naughty...”<br><br>“How like his father he is,” Pierre interjected.<br><br>Natásha knew why he mentioned Mítya’s likeness to Nicholas: the<br>recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and<br>he wanted to know what Natásha thought of it.<br><br>“Nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally<br>accepted. But I understand that you value what opens up a fresh line,”<br>said she, repeating words Pierre had once uttered.<br><br>“No, the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions are<br>an amusement—almost a pastime,” said Pierre. “For instance, he is<br>collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book<br>till he has read what he had already bought—Sismondi and Rousseau and<br>Montesquieu,” he added with a smile. “You know how much I...” he began<br>to soften down what he had said; but Natásha interrupted him to show<br>that this was unnecessary.<br><br>“So you say ideas are an amusement to him....”<br><br>“Yes, and for me nothing else is serious. All the time in Petersburg I<br>saw everyone as in a dream. When I am taken up by a thought, all else is<br>mere amusement.”<br><br>“Ah, I’m so sorry I wasn’t there when you met the children,” said<br>Natásha. “Which was most delighted? Lisa, I’m sure.”<br><br>“Yes,” Pierre replied, and went on with what was in his mind. “Nicholas<br>says we ought not to think. But I can’t help it. Besides, when I was in<br>Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) that the whole affair would go<br>to pieces without me—everyone was pulling his own way. But I succeeded<br>in uniting them all; and then my idea is so clear and simple. You see,<br>I don’t say that we ought to oppose this and that. We may be mistaken.<br>What I say is: ‘Join hands, you who love the right, and let there be but<br>one banner—that of active virtue.’ Prince Sergéy is a fine fellow and<br>clever.”<br><br>Natásha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of Pierre’s idea,<br>but one thing disconcerted her. “Can a man so important and necessary to<br>society be also my husband? How did this happen?” She wished to express<br>this doubt to him. “Now who could decide whether he is really cleverer<br>than all the others?” she asked herself, and passed in review all those<br>whom Pierre most respected. Judging by what he had said there was no one<br>he had respected so highly as Platón Karatáev.<br><br>“Do you know what I am thinking about?” she asked. “About Platón<br>Karatáev. Would he have approved of you now, do you think?”<br><br>Pierre was not at all surprised at this question. He understood his<br>wife’s line of thought.<br><br>“Platón Karatáev?” he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely<br>trying to imagine Karatáev’s opinion on the subject. “He would not have<br>understood... yet perhaps he would.”<br><br>“I love you awfully!” Natásha suddenly said. “Awfully, awfully!”<br><br>“No, he would not have approved,” said Pierre, after reflection. “What<br>he would have approved of is our family life. He was always so anxious<br>to find seemliness, happiness, and peace in everything, and I should<br>have been proud to let him see us. There now—you talk of my absence,<br>but you wouldn’t believe what a special feeling I have for you after a<br>separation....”<br><br>“Yes, I should think...” Natásha began.<br><br>“No, it’s not that. I never leave off loving you. And one couldn’t love<br>more, but this is something special.... Yes, of course—” he did not<br>finish because their eyes meeting said the rest.<br><br>“What nonsense it is,” Natásha suddenly exclaimed, “about honeymoons,<br>and that the greatest happiness is at first! On the contrary, now is<br>the best of all. If only you did not go away! Do you remember how<br>we quarreled? And it was always my fault. Always mine. And what we<br>quarreled about—I don’t even remember!”<br><br>“Always about the same thing,” said Pierre with a smile. “Jealo...”<br><br>“Don’t say it! I can’t bear it!” Natásha cried, and her eyes glittered<br>coldly and vindictively. “Did you see her?” she added, after a pause.<br><br>“No, and if I had I shouldn’t have recognized her.”<br><br>They were silent for a while.<br><br>“Oh, do you know? While you were talking in the study I was looking at<br>you,” Natásha began, evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had<br>come over them. “You are as like him as two peas—like the boy.” (She<br>meant her little son.) “Oh, it’s time to go to him.... The milk’s<br>come.... But I’m sorry to leave you.”<br><br>They were silent for a few seconds. Then suddenly turning to one<br>another at the same time they both began to speak. Pierre began with<br>self-satisfaction and enthusiasm, Natásha with a quiet, happy smile.<br>Having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other<br>continue.<br><br>“No. What did you say? Go on, go on.”<br><br>“No, you go on, I was talking nonsense,” said Natásha.<br><br>Pierre finished what he had begun. It was the sequel to his complacent<br>reflections on his success in Petersburg. At that moment it seemed to<br>him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of Russian<br>society and to the whole world.<br><br>“I only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always<br>simple ones. My whole idea is that if vicious people are united and<br>constitute a power, then honest folk must do the same. Now that’s simple<br>enough.”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“And what were you going to say?”<br><br>“I? Only nonsense.”<br><br>“But all the same?”<br><br>“Oh nothing, only a trifle,” said Natásha, smiling still more brightly.<br>“I only wanted to tell you about Pétya: today nurse was coming to take<br>him from me, and he laughed, shut his eyes, and clung to me. I’m sure<br>he thought he was hiding. Awfully sweet! There, now he’s crying. Well,<br>good-by!” and she left the room.<br><br><br>Meanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas Bolkónski’s bedroom a little lamp<br>was burning as usual. (The boy was afraid of the dark and they could<br>not cure him of it.) Dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his<br>Roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring. Little Nicholas, who had<br>just waked up in a cold perspiration, sat up in bed and gazed before him<br>with wide-open eyes. He had awaked from a terrible dream. He had dreamed<br>that he and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as were depicted in<br>his Plutarch, were leading a huge army. The army was made up of white<br>slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in<br>autumn and which Dessalles called les fils de la Vièrge. In front was<br>Glory, which was similar to those threads but rather thicker. He and<br>Pierre were borne along lightly and joyously, nearer and nearer to their<br>goal. Suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become<br>entangled and it grew difficult to move. And Uncle Nicholas stood before<br>them in a stern and threatening attitude.<br><br>“Have you done this?” he said, pointing to some broken sealing wax and<br>pens. “I loved you, but I have orders from Arakchéev and will kill<br>the first of you who moves forward.” Little Nicholas turned to look<br>at Pierre but Pierre was no longer there. In his place was his<br>father—Prince Andrew—and his father had neither shape nor form, but he<br>existed, and when little Nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love:<br>he felt himself powerless, limp, and formless. His father caressed and<br>pitied him. But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and nearer to them. Terror<br>seized young Nicholas and he awoke.<br><br>“My father!” he thought. (Though there were two good portraits of Prince<br>Andrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined him in human form.) “My<br>father has been with me and caressed me. He approved of me and of Uncle<br>Pierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it. Mucius Scaevola burned<br>his hand. Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me? I know<br>they want me to learn. And I will learn. But someday I shall have<br>finished learning, and then I will do something. I only pray God that<br>something may happen to me such as happened to Plutarch’s men, and I<br>will act as they did. I will do better. Everyone shall know me, love me,<br>and be delighted with me!” And suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and<br>he began to cry.<br><br>“Are you ill?” he heard Dessalles’ voice asking.<br><br>“No,” answered Nicholas, and lay back on his pillow.<br><br>“He is good and kind and I am fond of him!” he thought of Dessalles.<br>“But Uncle Pierre! Oh, what a wonderful man he is! And my father? Oh,<br>Father, Father! Yes, I will do something with which even he would be<br>satisfied....”<br><br><br><br><br><br>SECOND EPILOGUE<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>History is the life of nations and of humanity. To seize and put into<br>words, to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single<br>nation, appears impossible.<br><br>The ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe<br>and seize the apparently elusive—the life of a people. They described<br>the activity of individuals who ruled the people, and regarded the<br>activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation.<br><br>The question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by<br>what was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the ancients<br>met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of<br>a chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish<br>ends that were predestined.<br><br>For the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct<br>participation of the Deity in human affairs.<br><br>Modern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.<br><br>It would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man’s<br>subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations<br>are led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but<br>the causes that produce it. But modern history has not done this. Having<br>in theory rejected the view held by the ancients, it still follows them<br>in practice.<br><br>Instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by<br>the will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed with<br>extraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very various<br>kinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses. Instead of the<br>former divinely appointed aims of the Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations,<br>which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of<br>humanity, modern history has postulated its own aims—the welfare of the<br>French, German, or English people, or, in its highest abstraction, the<br>welfare and civilization of humanity in general, by which is usually<br>meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a<br>large continent.<br><br>Modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without<br>replacing them by a new conception, and the logic of the situation has<br>obliged the historians, after they had apparently rejected the divine<br>authority of the kings and the “fate” of the ancients, to reach the same<br>conclusion by another road, that is, to recognize (1) nations guided<br>by individual men, and (2) the existence of a known aim to which these<br>nations and humanity at large are tending.<br><br>At the basis of the works of all the modern historians from Gibbon to<br>Buckle, despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of<br>their outlooks, lie those two old, unavoidable assumptions.<br><br>In the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals<br>who in his opinion have directed humanity (one historian considers<br>only monarchs, generals, and ministers as being such men, while another<br>includes also orators, learned men, reformers, philosophers, and poets).<br>Secondly, it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led<br>is known to the historians: to one of them this goal is the greatness of<br>the Roman, Spanish, or French realm; to another it is liberty, equality,<br>and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called<br>Europe.<br><br>In 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and is expressed<br>by a movement of peoples from west to east. Several times it moves<br>eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward.<br>In 1812 it reaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, with remarkable<br>symmetry, a countermovement occurs from east to west, attracting to<br>it, as the first movement had done, the nations of middle Europe. The<br>counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the<br>west—Paris—and subsides.<br><br>During that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left<br>untilled, houses were burned, trade changed its direction, millions<br>of men migrated, were impoverished, or were enriched, and millions<br>of Christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one<br>another.<br><br>What does all this mean? Why did it happen? What made those people burn<br>houses and slay their fellow men? What were the causes of these events?<br>What force made men act so? These are the instinctive, plain, and<br>most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the<br>monuments and tradition of that period.<br><br>For a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the<br>science of history, whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know<br>themselves.<br><br>If history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have<br>said that God, to reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon power and<br>directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that reply<br>would have been clear and complete. One might believe or disbelieve<br>in the divine significance of Napoleon, but for anyone believing in<br>it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that<br>period, nor would there have been any contradictions.<br><br>But modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not admit the<br>conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the Deity<br>in human affairs, and therefore history ought to give other answers.<br><br>Modern history replying to these questions says: you want to know what<br>this movement means, what caused it, and what force produced these<br>events? Then listen:<br><br>“Louis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he had such and such<br>mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France badly. His<br>descendants were weak men and they too ruled France badly. And they had<br>such and such favorites and such and such mistresses. Moreover, certain<br>men wrote some books at that time. At the end of the eighteenth century<br>there were a couple of dozen men in Paris who began to talk about all<br>men being free and equal. This caused people all over France to begin<br>to slash at and drown one another. They killed the king and many other<br>people. At that time there was in France a man of genius—Napoleon. He<br>conquered everybody everywhere—that is, he killed many people because<br>he was a great genius. And for some reason he went to kill Africans, and<br>killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to<br>France he ordered everybody to obey him, and they all obeyed him. Having<br>become an Emperor he again went out to kill people in Italy, Austria,<br>and Prussia. And there too he killed a great many. In Russia there<br>was an Emperor, Alexander, who decided to restore order in Europe and<br>therefore fought against Napoleon. In 1807 he suddenly made friends<br>with him, but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many<br>people. Napoleon led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured<br>Moscow; then he suddenly ran away from Moscow, and the Emperor<br>Alexander, helped by the advice of Stein and others, united Europe to<br>arm against the disturber of its peace. All Napoleon’s allies suddenly<br>became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he<br>raised. The Allies defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to<br>abdicate, and sent him to the island of Elba, not depriving him of the<br>title of Emperor and showing him every respect, though five years before<br>and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand.<br>Then Louis XVIII, who till then had been the laughingstock both of the<br>French and the Allies, began to reign. And Napoleon, shedding tears<br>before his Old Guards, renounced the throne and went into exile. Then<br>the skillful statesmen and diplomatists (especially Talleyrand, who<br>managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and<br>thereby extended the frontiers of France) talked in Vienna and by<br>these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly the<br>diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of<br>again ordering their armies to kill one another, but just then Napoleon<br>arrived in France with a battalion, and the French, who had been hating<br>him, immediately all submitted to him. But the Allied monarchs were<br>angry at this and went to fight the French once more. And they defeated<br>the genius Napoleon and, suddenly recognizing him as a brigand, sent him<br>to the island of St. Helena. And the exile, separated from the beloved<br>France so dear to his heart, died a lingering death on that rock and<br>bequeathed his great deeds to posterity. But in Europe a reaction<br>occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their<br>subjects.”<br><br>It would be a mistake to think that this is ironic—a caricature of the<br>historical accounts. On the contrary it is a very mild expression of<br>the contradictory replies, not meeting the questions, which all the<br>historians give, from the compilers of memoirs and the histories<br>of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new<br>histories of the culture of that period.<br><br>The strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that<br>modern history, like a deaf man, answers questions no one has asked.<br><br>If the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of<br>humanity and of the peoples, the first question—in the absence of a<br>reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible—is: what is the<br>power that moves peoples? To this, modern history laboriously replies<br>either that Napoleon was a great genius, or that Louis XIV was very<br>proud, or that certain writers wrote certain books.<br><br>All that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, but it is not<br>what was asked. All that would be interesting if we recognized a divine<br>power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations<br>through Napoleons, Louis-es, and writers; but we do not acknowledge such<br>a power, and therefore before speaking about Napoleons, Louis-es, and<br>authors, we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men<br>and the movement of the nations.<br><br>If instead of a divine power some other force has appeared, it should<br>be explained in what this new force consists, for the whole interest of<br>history lies precisely in that force.<br><br>History seems to assume that this force is self-evident and known to<br>everyone. But in spite of every desire to regard it as known, anyone<br>reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new<br>force, so variously understood by the historians themselves, is really<br>quite well known to everybody.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>What force moves the nations?<br><br>Biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand<br>this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. In their narration<br>events occur solely by the will of a Napoleon, and Alexander, or in<br>general of the persons they describe. The answers given by this kind<br>of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are<br>satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event.<br>As soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin<br>to describe the same event, the replies they give immediately lose all<br>meaning, for this force is understood by them all not only differently<br>but often in quite contradictory ways. One historian says that an<br>event was produced by Napoleon’s power, another that it was produced by<br>Alexander’s, a third that it was due to the power of some other person.<br>Besides this, historians of that kind contradict each other even<br>in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some<br>particular person was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that Napoleon’s<br>power was based on his virtue and genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it<br>was based on his trickery and deception of the people. So the historians<br>of this class, by mutually destroying one another’s positions, destroy<br>the understanding of the force which produces events, and furnish no<br>reply to history’s essential question.<br><br>Writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to<br>recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians’ view of the force<br>which produces events. They do not recognize it as a power inherent in<br>heroes and rulers, but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously<br>directed forces. In describing a war or the subjugation of a people, a<br>general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power<br>of one man, but in the interaction of many persons connected with the<br>event.<br><br>According to this view the power of historical personages, represented<br>as the product of many forces, can no longer, it would seem, be regarded<br>as a force that itself produces events. Yet in most cases universal<br>historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself<br>produces events, and treat it as their cause. In their exposition, an<br>historic character is first the product of his time, and his power only<br>the resultant of various forces, and then his power is itself a force<br>producing events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for instance, at one<br>time prove Napoleon to be a product of the Revolution, of the ideas of<br>1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812<br>and other things they do not like were simply the product of Napoleon’s<br>misdirected will, and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their<br>development by Napoleon’s caprice. The ideas of the Revolution and the<br>general temper of the age produced Napoleon’s power. But Napoleon’s<br>power suppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of<br>the age.<br><br>This curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only does it occur at<br>every step, but the universal historians’ accounts are all made up of<br>a chain of such contradictions. This contradiction occurs because after<br>entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway.<br><br>To find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force, the<br>sum of the components must equal the resultant. This condition is never<br>observed by the universal historians, and so to explain the resultant<br>forces they are obliged to admit, in addition to the insufficient<br>components, another unexplained force affecting the resultant action.<br><br>Specialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration<br>of the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the<br>will of Alexander. But the universal historian Gervinus, refuting this<br>opinion of the specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of<br>1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside<br>Alexander’s will—such as the activity of Stein, Metternich, Madame de<br>Staël, Talleyrand, Fichte, Chateaubriand, and others. The historian<br>evidently decomposes Alexander’s power into the components: Talleyrand,<br>Chateaubriand, and the rest—but the sum of the components, that is,<br>the interactions of Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Staël, and the<br>others, evidently does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon<br>of millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand,<br>Madame de Staël, and others spoke certain words to one another only<br>affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission<br>of millions. And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs<br>the submission of millions of people resulted—that is, how component<br>forces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times A—the<br>historian is again obliged to fall back on power—the force he had<br>denied—and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, he<br>has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant. And that is<br>just what the universal historians do, and consequently they not only<br>contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves.<br><br>Peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain, say, according to<br>whether they want rain or fine weather: “The wind has blown the clouds<br>away,” or, “The wind has brought up the clouds.” And in the same way the<br>universal historians sometimes, when it pleases them and fits in with<br>their theory, say that power is the result of events, and sometimes,<br>when they want to prove something else, say that power produces events.<br><br>A third class of historians—the so-called historians of<br>culture—following the path laid down by the universal historians who<br>sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events—again<br>take that force to be something quite different. They see it in what is<br>called culture—in mental activity.<br><br>The historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their<br>progenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if historical<br>events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one<br>another in such and such ways, why not explain them by the fact that<br>such and such people wrote such and such books? Of the immense number of<br>indications accompanying every vital phenomenon, these historians select<br>the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is<br>the cause. But despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events<br>lies in intellectual activity, only by a great stretch can one admit<br>that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the<br>movement of peoples, and in no case can one admit that intellectual<br>activity controls people’s actions, for that view is not confirmed by<br>such facts as the very cruel murders of the French Revolution resulting<br>from the doctrine of the equality of man, or the very cruel wars and<br>executions resulting from the preaching of love.<br><br>But even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with<br>which these histories are filled—admitting that nations are governed by<br>some undefined force called an idea—history’s essential question still<br>remains unanswered, and to the former power of monarchs and to the<br>influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal<br>historians, another, newer force—the idea—is added, the connection of<br>which with the masses needs explanation. It is possible to understand<br>that Napoleon had power and so events occurred; with some effort one may<br>even conceive that Napoleon together with other influences was the cause<br>of an event; but how a book, Le Contrat Social, had the effect of making<br>Frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an<br>explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event.<br><br>Undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously,<br>and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual<br>activity of men and their historical movements, just as such a<br>connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce,<br>handicraft, gardening, or anything else you please. But why intellectual<br>activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or<br>expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand.<br>Only the following considerations can have led the historians to such<br>a conclusion: (1) that history is written by learned men, and so it is<br>natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class<br>supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity, just as a similar<br>belief is natural and agreeable to traders, agriculturists, and soldiers<br>(if they do not express it, that is merely because traders and soldiers<br>do not write history), and (2) that spiritual activity, enlightenment,<br>civilization, culture, ideas, are all indistinct, indefinite conceptions<br>under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less<br>definite meaning, and which can therefore be readily introduced into any<br>theory.<br><br>But not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind<br>(which may possibly even be of use to someone for something) the<br>histories of culture, to which all general histories tend more and more<br>to approximate, are significant from the fact that after seriously<br>and minutely examining various religious, philosophic, and political<br>doctrines as causes of events, as soon as they have to describe an<br>actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance, they<br>involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power—and say<br>plainly that that was the result of Napoleon’s will. Speaking so, the<br>historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves, and show that<br>the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in<br>history, and that history can only be explained by introducing a power<br>which they apparently do not recognize.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>A locomotive is moving. Someone asks: “What moves it?” A peasant says<br>the devil moves it. Another man says the locomotive moves because its<br>wheels go round. A third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in<br>the smoke which the wind carries away.<br><br>The peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation. To<br>refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil,<br>or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil<br>but a German, who moves the locomotive. Only then, as a result of the<br>contradiction, will they see that they are both wrong. But the man who<br>says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself, for<br>having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why<br>the wheels go round; and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the<br>movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler, he<br>has no right to stop in his search for the cause. The man who explains<br>the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has<br>noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the<br>first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an<br>explanation.<br><br>The only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is<br>that of a force commensurate with the movement observed.<br><br>The only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that<br>of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples.<br><br>Yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of<br>different kinds, all of which are incommensurate with the movement<br>observed. Some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes, as the<br>peasant sees the devil in the locomotive; others as a force resulting<br>from several other forces, like the movement of the wheels; others again<br>as an intellectual influence, like the smoke that is blown away.<br><br>So long as histories are written of separate individuals, whether<br>Caesars, Alexanders, Luthers, or Voltaires, and not the histories<br>of all, absolutely all those who take part in an event, it is quite<br>impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception<br>of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end.<br>And the only such conception known to historians is that of power.<br><br>This conception is the one handle by means of which the material of<br>history, as at present expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone who<br>breaks that handle off, as Buckle did, without finding some other method<br>of treating historical material, merely deprives himself of the one<br>possible way of dealing with it. The necessity of the conception of<br>power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by<br>the universal historians and historians of culture themselves, for they<br>professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at<br>every step.<br><br>In dealing with humanity’s inquiry, the science of history up to now<br>is like money in circulation—paper money and coin. The biographies and<br>special national histories are like paper money. They can be used and<br>can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even<br>advantageously, as long as no one asks what is the security behind them.<br>You need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events, and<br>such histories as Thiers’ will be interesting and instructive and may<br>perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry. But just as doubts of the real<br>value of paper money arise either because, being easy to make, too much<br>of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold, so also<br>doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because<br>too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart<br>someone inquires: by what force did Napoleon do this?—that is, wants<br>to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual<br>comprehension.<br><br>The writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are<br>like people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide to<br>substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity<br>of gold. It may indeed make jingling coin, but will do no more than<br>that. Paper money may deceive the ignorant, but nobody is deceived by<br>tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle. As gold is<br>gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use,<br>so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to<br>history’s essential question: what is power? The universal historians<br>give contradictory replies to that question, while the historians of<br>culture evade it and answer something quite different. And as counters<br>of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to<br>accept them as gold, or among those who do not know the nature of<br>gold, so universal historians and historians of culture, not answering<br>humanity’s essential question, serve as currency for some purposes of<br>their own, only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a<br>taste for what they call “serious reading.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>Having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine<br>subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection<br>of that man’s will to the Deity, history cannot without contradictions<br>take a single step till it has chosen one of two things: either a return<br>to the former belief in the direct intervention of the Deity in human<br>affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing<br>historical events and termed “power.”<br><br>A return to the first is impossible, the belief has been destroyed; and<br>so it is essential to explain what is meant by power.<br><br>Napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war. We are so<br>accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question:<br>why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when Napoleon uttered<br>certain words, seems to us senseless. He had the power and so what he<br>ordered was done.<br><br>This reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given<br>him by God. But as soon as we do not admit that, it becomes essential to<br>determine what is this power of one man over others.<br><br>It cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one—a<br>domination based on the application or threat of physical force, like<br>the power of Hercules; nor can it be based on the effect of moral force,<br>as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading<br>figures in history are heroes, that is, men gifted with a special<br>strength of soul and mind called genius. This power cannot be based on<br>the predominance of moral strength, for, not to mention heroes such as<br>Napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely, history<br>shows us that neither a Louis XI nor a Metternich, who ruled over<br>millions of people, had any particular moral qualities, but on the<br>contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they<br>ruled over.<br><br>If the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral<br>qualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently be looked for<br>elsewhere—in the relation to the people of the man who wields the power.<br><br>And that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence,<br>that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange history’s<br>understanding of power for true gold.<br><br>Power is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed or<br>tacit consent, to their chosen rulers.<br><br>In the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions of how a<br>state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to<br>be arranged, it is all very clear; but when applied to history that<br>definition of power needs explanation.<br><br>The science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients<br>regarded fire—namely, as something existing absolutely.

Was the will of the Russian people transferred<br>to Napoleon in 1809, when our army in alliance with the French went to<br>fight the Austrians?<br><br>To these questions three answers are possible:<br><br>Either to assume (1) that the will of the people is always<br>unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen, and<br>that therefore every emergence of a new power, every struggle<br>against the power once appointed, should be absolutely regarded as an<br>infringement of the real power; or (2) that the will of the people<br>is transferred to the rulers conditionally, under definite and known<br>conditions, and to show that all limitations, conflicts, and even<br>destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the<br>conditions under which their power was entrusted to them; or (3) that<br>the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally, but<br>that the conditions are unknown and indefinite, and that the appearance<br>of several authorities, their struggles and their falls, result solely<br>from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown<br>conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some<br>people to others.<br><br>And these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the<br>relation of the people to their rulers.<br><br>Some historians—those biographical and specialist historians already<br>referred to—in their simplicity failing to understand the question of<br>the meaning of power, seem to consider that the collective will of<br>the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons, and<br>therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular<br>power to be the one absolute and real power, and that any other force<br>opposing this is not a power but a violation of power—mere violence.<br><br>Their theory, suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history,<br>has the inconvenience—in application to complex and stormy periods in<br>the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and<br>struggle with one another—that a Legitimist historian will prove<br>that the National Convention, the Directory, and Bonaparte were mere<br>infringers of the true power, while a Republican and a Bonapartist will<br>prove: the one that the Convention and the other that the Empire was the<br>real power, and that all the others were violations of power.<br>Evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually<br>contradictory can only satisfy young children.<br><br>Recognizing the falsity of this view of history, another set of<br>historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will<br>of the people to their rulers, and that historical leaders have power<br>only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the<br>people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them. But what this program<br>consists in these historians do not say, or if they do they continually<br>contradict one another.<br><br>Each historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nation’s<br>progress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth, freedom,<br>or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country. But not<br>to mention the historians’ contradictions as to the nature of this<br>program—or even admitting that some one general program of these<br>conditions exists—the facts of history almost always contradict that<br>theory. If the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the<br>wealth, freedom, and enlightenment of the people, how is it that Louis<br>XIV and Iván the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI<br>and Charles I are executed by their people? To this question historians<br>reply that Louis XIV’s activity, contrary to the program, reacted on<br>Louis XVI. But why did it not react on Louis XIV or on Louis XV—why<br>should it react just on Louis XVI? And what is the time limit for such<br>reactions? To these questions there are and can be no answers. Equally<br>little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective<br>will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs, and<br>then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the<br>Convention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII,<br>to Napoleon again, to Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republican<br>government, and to Napoleon III. When explaining these rapid transfers<br>of the people’s will from one individual to another, especially in view<br>of international relations, conquests, and alliances, the historians are<br>obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations<br>of the people’s will but are accidents dependent on cunning, on<br>mistakes, on craft, or on the weakness of a diplomatist, a ruler, or a<br>party leader. So that the greater part of the events of history—civil<br>wars, revolutions, and conquests—are presented by these historians<br>not as the results of free transferences of the people’s will, but as<br>results of the ill-directed will of one or more individuals, that is,<br>once again, as usurpations of power. And so these historians also see<br>and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory.<br><br>These historians resemble a botanist who, having noticed that some<br>plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist that all<br>that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves, and that the palm, the<br>mushroom, and even the oak, which blossom into full growth and no longer<br>resemble two leaves, are deviations from the theory.<br><br>Historians of the third class assume that the will of the people<br>is transferred to historic personages conditionally, but that the<br>conditions are unknown to us. They say that historical personages have<br>power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been<br>delegated to them.<br><br>But in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not in the<br>historic leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have<br>those leaders?<br><br>The leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the people:<br>the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people.<br><br>But in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the<br>leaders serves as an expression of the people’s will or only some part<br>of it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of<br>the people’s will, as some historians suppose, then all the details<br>of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or<br>a Catherine serve to express the life of the nation, which is evident<br>nonsense; but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an<br>historical leader which serves to express the people’s life, as other<br>so-called “philosophical” historians believe, then to determine which<br>side of the activity of a leader expresses the nation’s life, we have<br>first of all to know in what the nation’s life consists.<br><br>Met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most<br>obscure, impalpable, and general abstraction which can cover all<br>conceivable occurrences, and declare this abstraction to be the aim of<br>humanity’s movement. The most usual generalizations adopted by almost<br>all the historians are: freedom, equality, enlightenment, progress,<br>civilization, and culture. Postulating some generalization as the goal<br>of the movement of humanity, the historians study the men of whom the<br>greatest number of monuments have remained: kings, ministers, generals,<br>authors, reformers, popes, and journalists, to the extent to which in<br>their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction.<br>But as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in<br>freedom, equality, enlightenment, or civilization, and as the connection<br>of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based<br>on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is<br>always transferred to the men whom we have noticed, it happens that the<br>activity of the millions who migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture,<br>and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the<br>activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses, practice<br>agriculture, or slay their fellow creatures.<br><br>History proves this at every turn. Is the ferment of the peoples of<br>the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward<br>explained by the activity of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI, their mistresses<br>and ministers, and by the lives of Napoleon, Rousseau, Diderot,<br>Beaumarchais, and others?<br><br>Is the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kazán and Siberia<br>expressed by details of the morbid character of Iván the Terrible and by<br>his correspondence with Kúrbski?<br><br>Is the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by<br>the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their ladies?<br>For us that movement of the peoples from west to east, without<br>leaders, with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the Hermit, remains<br>incomprehensible. And yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that<br>movement when a rational and sacred aim for the Crusade—the deliverance<br>of Jerusalem—had been clearly defined by historic leaders. Popes, kings,<br>and knights incited the peoples to free the Holy Land; but the people<br>did not go, for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to<br>go no longer existed. The history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers<br>can evidently not cover the life of the peoples. And the history of the<br>Godfreys and the Minnesingers has remained the history of Godfreys<br>and Minnesingers, but the history of the life of the peoples and their<br>impulses has remained unknown.<br><br>Still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the<br>life of the peoples.<br><br>The history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of<br>life and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther had<br>a hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was<br>suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why after<br>the Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why during the<br>French Revolution they guillotined one another.<br><br>If we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the newest<br>historians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, but not<br>the history of the life of the peoples.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>The life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men, for<br>the connection between those men and the nations has not been found.<br>The theory that this connection is based on the transference of the<br>collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an<br>hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history.<br><br>The theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to<br>historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence<br>and be essential for its purposes, but in its application to history, as<br>soon as revolutions, conquests, or civil wars occur—that is, as soon as<br>history begins—that theory explains nothing.<br><br>The theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the<br>people’s will cannot be verified, for it never occurred.<br><br>Whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the<br>theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because<br>the collective will was transferred to him.<br><br>The replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the<br>replies of a man who, watching the movements of a herd of cattle and<br>paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different<br>parts of the field, or to the driving of the herdsman, should attribute<br>the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head.<br><br>“The herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads<br>it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that<br>leader.” This is what historians of the first class say—those who assume<br>the unconditional transference of the people’s will.<br><br>“If the animals leading the herd change, this happens because the<br>collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to<br>another, according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in<br>the direction selected by the whole herd.” Such is the reply historians<br>who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to<br>rulers under conditions which they regard as known. (With this method<br>of observation it often happens that the observer, influenced by the<br>direction he himself prefers, regards those as leaders who, owing to the<br>people’s change of direction, are no longer in front, but on one side,<br>or even in the rear.)<br><br>“If the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of<br>the whole herd is constantly altered, this is because in order to follow<br>a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that<br>have attracted our attention, and to study the movements of the herd<br>we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all<br>sides of the herd.” So say the third class of historians who regard all<br>historical persons, from monarchs to journalists, as the expression of<br>their age.<br><br>The theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic<br>persons is merely a paraphrase—a restatement of the question in other<br>words.<br><br>What causes historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the<br>collective will of the people transferred to one person. Under what<br>condition is the will of the people delegated to one person? On<br>condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people. That<br>is, power is power: in other words, power is a word the meaning of which<br>we do not understand.<br><br>If the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning,<br>then having subjected to criticism the explanation of “power” that<br>juridical science gives us, humanity would conclude that power is merely<br>a word and has no real existence.

Alexander I gives a command and the French submit to the<br>Bourbons. Experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always<br>related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it.<br><br>The historians, in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine<br>intervention in human affairs, want to see the cause of events in<br>the expression of the will of someone endowed with power, but that<br>supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience.<br><br>On the one side reflection shows that the expression of a man’s will—his<br>words—are only part of the general activity expressed in an event,<br>as for instance in a war or a revolution, and so without assuming an<br>incomprehensible, supernatural force—a miracle—one cannot admit that<br>words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men.<br>On the other hand, even if we admitted that words could be the cause<br>of events, history shows that the expression of the will of historical<br>personages does not in most cases produce any effect, that is to say,<br>their commands are often not executed, and sometimes the very opposite<br>of what they order occurs.<br><br>Without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we<br>cannot regard “power” as the cause of events.<br><br>Power, from the standpoint of experience, is merely the relation that<br>exists between the expression of someone’s will and the execution of<br>that will by others.<br><br>To explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a<br>conception of the expression of will, referring it to man and not to the<br>Deity.<br><br>If the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient history<br>tells us, the expression of that will is independent of time and is not<br>caused by anything, for the Divinity is not controlled by an event.

Napoleon could not have commanded<br>an invasion of Russia and never did so. Today he ordered such and such<br>papers to be written to Vienna, to Berlin, and to Petersburg;<br>tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army, the fleet, the<br>commissariat, and so on and so on—millions of commands, which formed<br>a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the<br>French armies into Russia.<br><br>If throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion<br>of England and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort,<br>and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that<br>design but undertook an expedition into Russia, with which country he<br>considered it desirable to be in alliance (a conviction he repeatedly<br>expressed)—this came about because his commands did not correspond to<br>the course of events in the first case, but did so correspond in the<br>latter.<br><br>For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should<br>order what can be executed. But to know what can and what cannot be<br>executed is impossible, not only in the case of Napoleon’s invasion of<br>Russia in which millions participated, but even in the simplest event,<br>for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its<br>execution. Every order executed is always one of an immense number<br>unexecuted. All the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of<br>events remain unexecuted. Only the possible ones get linked up with a<br>consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events, and<br>are executed.<br><br>Our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes<br>it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of<br>thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that<br>event have been executed, we forget about the others that were not<br>executed because they could not be. Apart from that, the chief source<br>of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical<br>accounts a whole series of innumerable, diverse, and petty events, such<br>for instance as all those which led the French armies to Russia, is<br>generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that<br>series of events, and corresponding with this generalization the whole<br>series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will.<br><br>We say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it. In<br>reality in all Napoleon’s activity we never find anything resembling an<br>expression of that wish, but find a series of orders, or expressions of<br>his will, very variously and indefinitely directed.

This relation consists in the following:<br><br>For common action people always unite in certain combinations, in which<br>regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action, the<br>relation between those taking part in it is always the same.<br><br>Men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward<br>one another that the larger number take a more direct share, and the<br>smaller number a less direct share, in the collective action for which<br>they have combined.<br><br>Of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of<br>the most striking and definite examples is an army.<br><br>Every army is composed of lower grades of the service—the rank and<br>file—of whom there are always the greatest number; of the next higher<br>military rank—corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are<br>fewer, and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer,<br>and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one<br>person.<br><br>A military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone, of<br>which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file;<br>the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next<br>higher grades of the army, and so on to the apex, the point of which<br>will represent the commander in chief.<br><br>The soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section of<br>the cone and its base. The soldier himself does the stabbing, hacking,<br>burning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for these actions<br>from men above him; he himself never gives an order. The noncommissioned<br>officers (of whom there are fewer) perform the action itself less<br>frequently than the soldiers, but they already give commands. An<br>officer still less often acts directly himself, but commands still more<br>frequently. A general does nothing but command the troops, indicates the<br>objective, and hardly ever uses a weapon himself. The commander in chief<br>never takes direct part in the action itself, but only gives general<br>orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops. A similar<br>relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men<br>for common activity—in agriculture, trade, and every administration.<br><br>And so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of<br>a cone and of the ranks of an army, or the ranks and positions in<br>any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the<br>highest, we see a law by which men, to take associated action, combine<br>in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing<br>the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are,<br>while the less their direct participation in the action itself, the more<br>they command and the fewer of them there are; rising in this way from<br>the lowest ranks to the man at the top, who takes the least direct share<br>in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding.<br><br>This relation of the men who command to those they command is what<br>constitutes the essence of the conception called power.<br><br>Having restored the condition of time under which all events occur,<br>we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a<br>corresponding series of events. Restoring the essential condition of<br>relation between those who command and those who execute, we find that<br>by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part<br>in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to<br>commanding.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>When an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes<br>about it, and as the event results from the collective activity of<br>many people, some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be<br>fulfilled if but approximately. When one of the opinions expressed<br>is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with the event as a command<br>preceding it.<br><br>Men are hauling a log. Each of them expresses his opinion as to how and<br>where to haul it. They haul the log away, and it happens that this is<br>done as one of them said. He ordered it. There we have command and power<br>in their primary form. The man who worked most with his hands could not<br>think so much about what he was doing, or reflect on or command what<br>would result from the common activity; while the man who commanded<br>more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater<br>verbal activity.<br><br>When some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim<br>there is a yet sharper division of those who, because their activity is<br>given to directing and commanding, take less part in the direct work.<br><br>When a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which<br>as it seems to him directed his past activity, justify his present<br>activity, and guide him in planning his future actions. Just the same is<br>done by a concourse of people, allowing those who do not take a direct<br>part in the activity to devise considerations, justifications, and<br>surmises concerning their collective activity.<br><br>For reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and kill<br>one another. And corresponding to the event its justification appears in<br>people’s belief that this was necessary for the welfare of France, for<br>liberty, and for equality. People ceased to kill one another, and<br>this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a<br>centralization of power, resistance to Europe, and so on. Men went<br>from the west to the east killing their fellow men, and the event<br>was accompanied by phrases about the glory of France, the baseness of<br>England, and so on. History shows us that these justifications of the<br>events have no common sense and are all contradictory, as in the case of<br>killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights, and the killing<br>of millions in Russia for the humiliation of England. But these<br>justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day.<br><br>These justifications release those who produce the events from moral<br>responsibility. These temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front<br>of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front: they clear<br>men’s moral responsibilities from their path.<br><br>Without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest<br>question that presents itself when examining each historical event. How<br>is it that millions of men commit collective crimes—make war, commit<br>murder, and so on?<br><br>With the present complex forms of political and social life in Europe<br>can any event that is not prescribed, decreed, or ordered by monarchs,<br>ministers, parliaments, or newspapers be imagined? Is there any<br>collective action which cannot find its justification in political<br>unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization? So<br>that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed<br>wish and, receiving a justification, presents itself as the result of<br>the will of one man or of several men.<br><br>In whatever direction a ship moves, the flow of the waves it cuts<br>will always be noticeable ahead of it. To those on board the ship the<br>movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion.<br><br>Only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and<br>comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that<br>every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship,<br>and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were<br>imperceptibly moving.<br><br>We see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical<br>characters (that is, re-establish the inevitable condition of all that<br>occurs—the continuity of movement in time) and do not lose sight of the<br>essential connection of historical persons with the masses.<br><br>When the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave<br>ahead of it, when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns<br>frequently. But wherever it may turn there always will be the wave<br>anticipating its movement.<br><br>Whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen<br>and decreed. Wherever the ship may go, the rush of water which neither<br>directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it, and at a distance<br>seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ship’s<br>movement also.<br><br>Examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons<br>which, as commands, were related to events, historians have assumed<br>that the events depended on those commands. But examining the events<br>themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to<br>the people, we have found that they and their orders were dependent on<br>events. The incontestable proof of this deduction is that, however many<br>commands were issued, the event does not take place unless there are<br>other causes for it, but as soon as an event occurs—be it what it<br>may—then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people<br>some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of<br>utterance are related as commands to the events.<br><br>Arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to<br>these two essential questions of history:<br><br>(1) What is power?<br><br>(2) What force produces the movement of the nations?<br><br>(1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals,<br>in which the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and<br>justifications of the collective action that is performed, the less is<br>his participation in that action.<br><br>(2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by intellectual<br>activity, nor even by a combination of the two as historians have<br>supposed, but by the activity of all the people who participate in<br>the events, and who always combine in such a way that those taking<br>the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least<br>responsibility and vice versa.<br><br>Morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event; physically<br>it is those who submit to the power. But as the moral activity is<br>inconceivable without the physical, the cause of the event is neither in<br>the one nor in the other but in the union of the two.<br><br>Or in other words, the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the<br>phenomena we are examining.<br><br>In the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity—that final limit<br>to which in every domain of thought man’s reason arrives if it is not<br>playing with the subject. Electricity produces heat, heat produces<br>electricity. Atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another.<br><br>Speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms, we<br>cannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so because it is<br>inconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and that it is a law. The<br>same applies to historical events. Why war and revolution occur we do<br>not know. We only know that to produce the one or the other action,<br>people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part, and<br>we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise, or in other<br>words that it is a law.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>If history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment of this<br>simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our<br>argument. But the law of history relates to man. A particle of matter<br>cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion<br>and that that law is untrue, but man, who is the subject of history,<br>says plainly: I am free and am therefore not subject to the law.<br><br>The presence of the problem of man’s free will, though unexpressed, is<br>felt at every step of history.<br><br>All seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this<br>question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the<br>false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of<br>a solution of that question.<br><br>If the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act as he<br>pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected incidents.<br><br>If in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely, that<br>is, as he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that man’s<br>in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the<br>possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity.<br><br>If there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will cannot<br>exist, for then man’s will is subject to that law.<br><br>In this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most<br>ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient<br>times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance.<br><br>The problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation<br>from whatever point of view—theological, historical, ethical, or<br>philosophic—we find a general law of necessity to which he (like all<br>that exists) is subject. But regarding him from within ourselves as what<br>we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free.<br><br>This consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and<br>independent of reason. Through his reason man observes himself, but only<br>through consciousness does he know himself.<br><br>Apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason<br>is conceivable.<br><br>To understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first of all be<br>conscious of himself as living. A man is only conscious of himself as<br>a living being by the fact that he wills, that is, is conscious of<br>his volition. But his will—which forms the essence of his life—man<br>recognizes (and can but recognize) as free.<br><br>If, observing himself, man sees that his will is always directed by<br>one and the same law (whether he observes the necessity of taking<br>food, using his brain, or anything else) he cannot recognize this<br>never-varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of<br>it. Were it not free it could not be limited. A man’s will seems to him<br>to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free.<br><br>You say: I am not free. But I have lifted my hand and let it fall.<br>Everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable<br>demonstration of freedom.<br><br>That reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to<br>reason.<br><br>If the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent<br>source of self-consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and<br>to experience, but in fact such subjection does not exist and is<br>inconceivable.<br><br>A series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he, as<br>an object of observation, is subject to certain laws, and man submits to<br>them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he<br>has become acquainted with them. But the same series of experiments<br>and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is<br>conscious in himself is impossible, and that his every action depends<br>on his organization, his character, and the motives acting upon him; yet<br>man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments.<br>Having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls<br>downwards, a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law<br>that he has learned to be fulfilled.<br><br>But learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws, he does<br>not and cannot believe this.<br><br>However often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the<br>same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as<br>before, yet when under the same conditions and with the same character<br>he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the<br>same way, he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment<br>that he can act as he pleases. Every man, savage or sage, however<br>incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is<br>impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the<br>same conditions, feels that without this irrational conception (which<br>constitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot imagine life. He feels<br>that however impossible it may be, it is so, for without this conception<br>of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life, but he would<br>be unable to live for a single moment.<br><br>He could not live, because all man’s efforts, all his impulses to life,<br>are only efforts to increase freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame and<br>obscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness, health and<br>disease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion and hunger,<br>virtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom.<br><br>A man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of<br>life.<br><br>If the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless<br>contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and<br>the same instant of time, or of an effect without a cause, that only<br>proves that consciousness is not subject to reason.<br><br>This unshakable, irrefutable consciousness of freedom, uncontrolled by<br>experiment or argument, recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone<br>without exception, this consciousness without which no conception of man<br>is possible constitutes the other side of the question.<br><br>Man is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing God.<br>What is sin, the conception of which arises from the consciousness of<br>man’s freedom? That is a question for theology.<br><br>The actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in<br>statistics. What is man’s responsibility to society, the conception of<br>which results from the conception of freedom? That is a question for<br>jurisprudence.<br><br>Man’s actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting<br>upon him. What is conscience and the perception of right and wrong<br>in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom? That is a<br>question for ethics.<br><br>Man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject<br>to laws which determine that life. But the same man apart from that<br>connection appears to be free. How should the past life of nations and<br>of humanity be regarded—as the result of the free, or as the result of<br>the constrained, activity of man? That is a question for history.<br><br>Only in our self-confident day of the popularization of knowledge—thanks<br>to that most powerful engine of ignorance, the diffusion of printed<br>matter—has the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on<br>which the question itself cannot exist. In our time the majority of<br>so-called advanced people—that is, the crowd of ignoramuses—have taken<br>the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a<br>solution of the whole problem.<br><br>They say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist,<br>for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular<br>movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves; the soul and<br>free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang<br>from the apes. They say this, not at all suspecting that thousands of<br>years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now<br>trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely<br>acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers, but has never<br>been denied. They do not see that the role of the natural sciences in<br>this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination<br>of one side of it. For the fact that, from the point of view of<br>observation, reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain, and<br>that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals<br>at some unknown period of time, only explains from a fresh side<br>the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and<br>philosophic theories—that from the point of view of reason man is<br>subject to the law of necessity; but it does not advance by a hair’s<br>breadth the solution of the question, which has another, opposite, side,<br>based on the consciousness of freedom.<br><br>If men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time, that is<br>as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a<br>certain period of time (in the first case the unknown quantity is the<br>time, in the second case it is the origin); and the question of how<br>man’s consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of<br>necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative<br>physiology and zoology, for in a frog, a rabbit, or an ape, we can<br>observe only the muscular nervous activity, but in man we observe<br>consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity.<br><br>The naturalists and their followers, thinking they can solve this<br>question, are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of<br>a church who, availing themselves of the absence of the chief<br>superintendent of the work, should in an access of zeal plaster over the<br>windows, icons, woodwork, and still unbuttressed walls, and should be<br>delighted that from their point of view as plasterers, everything is now<br>so smooth and regular.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IX<br><br>For the solution of the question of free will or inevitability, history<br>has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the<br>question is dealt with, that for history this question does not refer<br>to the essence of man’s free will but its manifestation in the past and<br>under certain conditions.<br><br>In regard to this question, history stands to the other sciences as<br>experimental science stands to abstract science.<br><br>The subject for history is not man’s will itself but our presentation of<br>it.<br><br>And so for history, the insoluble mystery presented by the<br>incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does<br>for theology, ethics, and philosophy. History surveys a presentation of<br>man’s life in which the union of these two contradictions has already<br>taken place.<br><br>In actual life each historic event, each human action, is very clearly<br>and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction, although<br>each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory.<br><br>To solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and<br>what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions, the philosophy<br>of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other<br>sciences. Instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and<br>inevitability in themselves, and then ranging the phenomena of life<br>under those definitions, history should deduce a definition of the<br>conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense<br>quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear<br>dependent on these two elements.<br><br>Whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual<br>we may consider, we always regard it as the result partly of man’s free<br>will and partly of the law of inevitability.<br><br>Whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions<br>of the barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of someone’s<br>action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his<br>walk, we are unconscious of any contradiction. The degree of freedom and<br>inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined<br>for us.<br><br>Our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to<br>differences in the point of view from which we regard the event, but<br>every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and<br>inevitability. In every action we examine we see a certain measure of<br>freedom and a certain measure of inevitability. And always the more<br>freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive, and<br>the more inevitability the less freedom.<br><br>The proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases<br>according to the point of view from which the action is regarded, but<br>their relation is always one of inverse proportion.<br><br>A sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry mother<br>exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a man trained<br>to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless<br>man—seem less guilty, that is, less free and more subject to the law of<br>necessity, to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were<br>placed, and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself<br>drowning, that the mother was hungry, that the soldier was in the ranks,<br>and so on. Similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and<br>has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty<br>and his action more due to the law of inevitability, to someone who<br>considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who<br>examined it the day after it was committed. And in the same way every<br>action of an insane, intoxicated, or highly excited man appears less<br>free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him<br>who committed the action, and seems more free and less inevitable to one<br>who does not know it. In all these cases the conception of freedom<br>is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is<br>correspondingly decreased or increased, according to the point of view<br>from which the action is regarded. So that the greater the conception of<br>necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa.<br><br>Religion, the common sense of mankind, the science of jurisprudence,<br>and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and<br>freedom.<br><br>All cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and<br>necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations:<br><br>(1) The relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds.<br><br>(2) His relation to time.<br><br>(3) His relation to the causes leading to the action.<br><br>The first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the man’s<br>relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness<br>of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man<br>in relation to everything coexisting with him. This is what makes it<br>evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity<br>than one standing on dry ground, and that makes the actions of a man<br>closely connected with others in a thickly populated district, or of one<br>bound by family, official, or business duties, seem certainly less free<br>and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and<br>seclusion.<br><br>If we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything around<br>him, each action of his seems to us free. But if we see his relation<br>to anything around him, if we see his connection with anything<br>whatever—with a man who speaks to him, a book he reads, the work on<br>which he is engaged, even with the air he breathes or the light that<br>falls on the things about him—we see that each of these circumstances<br>has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity.<br>And the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of<br>his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that<br>weighs on him increases.<br><br>The second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of<br>the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place<br>the man’s action occupies in time. That is the ground which makes the<br>fall of the first man, resulting in the production of the human race,<br>appear evidently less free than a man’s entry into marriage today. It is<br>the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago<br>and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life<br>of a contemporary, the consequences of which are still unknown to me.<br><br>The degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this<br>respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance<br>of the action and our judgment of it.<br><br>If I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same<br>circumstances as those I am in now, my action appears to me undoubtedly<br>free. But if I examine an act performed a month ago, then being in<br>different circumstances, I cannot help recognizing that if that act had<br>not been committed much that resulted from it—good, agreeable, and even<br>essential—would not have taken place. If I reflect on an action still<br>more remote, ten years ago or more, then the consequences of my action<br>are still plainer to me and I find it hard to imagine what would have<br>happened had that action not been performed. The farther I go back<br>in memory, or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my<br>judgment, the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my<br>action.<br><br>In history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning<br>the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity. A<br>contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the<br>known participants, but with a more remote event we already see its<br>inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible.<br>And the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do<br>they appear.<br><br>The Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the<br>crafty conduct of Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars still seem<br>to us, though already questionably, to be the outcome of their heroes’<br>will. But in the Crusades we already see an event occupying its definite<br>place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history<br>of Europe, though to the chroniclers of the Crusades that event appeared<br>as merely due to the will of certain people. In regard to the migration<br>of the peoples it does not enter anyone’s head today to suppose that<br>the renovation of the European world depended on Attila’s caprice. The<br>farther back in history the object of our observation lies, the more<br>doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and<br>the more manifest the law of inevitability.<br><br>The third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that<br>endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason, in which each<br>phenomenon comprehended, and therefore man’s every action, must have<br>its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of<br>what will follow.<br><br>The better we are acquainted with the physiological, psychological, and<br>historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled,<br>and the more correctly we perceive the physiological, psychological,<br>and historical causes of the action, and the simpler the action we are<br>observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in<br>question, the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our<br>actions and those of others appear.<br><br>When we do not at all understand the cause of an action, whether a<br>crime, a good action, or even one that is simply nonmoral, we ascribe a<br>greater amount of freedom to it. In the case of a crime we most urgently<br>demand the punishment for such an act; in the case of a virtuous act we<br>rate its merit most highly. In an indifferent case we recognize in it<br>more individuality, originality, and independence. But if even one of<br>the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain<br>element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime,<br>or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom<br>of the apparently original action. That a criminal was reared among<br>malefactors mitigates his fault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father<br>or mother, or self-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward, is more<br>comprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore seems less<br>deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will. The founder of a<br>sect or party, or an inventor, impresses us less when we know how or by<br>what the way was prepared for his activity. If we have a large range<br>of examples, if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the<br>correlation of cause and effect in people’s actions, their actions<br>appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we<br>connect the effects with the causes. If we examined simple actions and<br>had a vast number of such actions under observation, our conception of<br>their inevitability would be still greater. The dishonest conduct of the<br>son of a dishonest father, the misconduct of a woman who had fallen<br>into bad company, a drunkard’s relapse into drunkenness, and so on are<br>actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause.<br>If the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of<br>mental development, like a child, a madman, or a simpleton—then,<br>knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and<br>intelligence in question, we see so large an element of necessity and so<br>little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action<br>we can foretell the result.<br><br>On these three considerations alone is based the conception of<br>irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted<br>by all legislative codes. The responsibility appears greater or less<br>according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in<br>which the man was placed whose action is being judged, and according<br>to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the<br>action and its investigation, and according to the greater or lesser<br>understanding of the causes that led to the action.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER X<br><br>Thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes<br>or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the<br>external world, the greater or lesser remoteness of time, and the<br>greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we<br>contemplate a man’s life.<br><br>So that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the<br>external world is well known, where the time between the action and<br>its examination is great, and where the causes of the action are most<br>accessible, we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a<br>minimum of free will. If we examine a man little dependent on external<br>conditions, whose action was performed very recently, and the causes of<br>whose action are beyond our ken, we get the conception of a minimum of<br>inevitability and a maximum of freedom.<br><br>In neither case—however we may change our point of view, however plain<br>we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external<br>world, however inaccessible it may be to us, however long or short the<br>period of time, however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes<br>of the action may be—can we ever conceive either complete freedom or<br>complete necessity.<br><br>(1) To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the<br>influence of the external world, we never get a conception of freedom<br>in space. Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds<br>him and by his own body. I lift my arm and let it fall. My action seems<br>to me free; but asking myself whether I could raise my arm in every<br>direction, I see that I raised it in the direction in which there was<br>least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from<br>the construction of my own body. I chose one out of all the possible<br>directions because in it there were fewest obstacles. For my action<br>to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles. To<br>conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space, which is<br>evidently impossible.<br><br>(2) However much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the<br>deed, we never get a conception of freedom in time. For if I examine<br>an action committed a second ago I must still recognize it as not<br>being free, for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was<br>committed. Can I lift my arm? I lift it, but ask myself: could I have<br>abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed? To<br>convince myself of this I do not lift it the next moment. But I am<br>not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when I asked the<br>question. Time has gone by which I could not detain, the arm I then<br>lifted is no longer the same as the arm I now refrain from lifting,<br>nor is the air in which I lifted it the same that now surrounds me. The<br>moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable, and at that<br>moment I could make only one movement, and whatever movement I made<br>would be the only one. That I did not lift my arm a moment later does<br>not prove that I could have abstained from lifting it then. And since I<br>could make only one movement at that single moment of time, it could not<br>have been any other. To imagine it as free, it is necessary to imagine<br>it in the present, on the boundary between the past and the future—that<br>is, outside time, which is impossible.<br><br>(3) However much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be<br>increased, we never reach a conception of complete freedom, that is,<br>an absence of cause. However inaccessible to us may be the cause of the<br>expression of will in any action, our own or another’s, the first demand<br>of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause, for without a<br>cause no phenomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to perform an action<br>independently of any cause, but my wish to perform an action without a<br>cause is the cause of my action.<br><br>But even if—imagining a man quite exempt from all influences, examining<br>only his momentary action in the present, unevoked by any cause—we were<br>to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled<br>zero, we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete<br>freedom in man, for a being uninfluenced by the external world, standing<br>outside of time and independent of cause, is no longer a man.<br><br>In the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of<br>freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability.<br><br>(1) However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space<br>in which man is situated, that knowledge can never be complete, for the<br>number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space. And<br>therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined,<br>there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom<br>remains.<br><br>(2) However we may prolong the period of time between the action we are<br>examining and the judgment upon it, that period will be finite, while<br>time is infinite, and so in this respect too there can never be absolute<br>inevitability.<br><br>(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action, we<br>shall never know the whole chain since it is endless, and so again we<br>never reach absolute inevitability.<br><br>But besides this, even if, admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to<br>equal zero, we assumed in some given case—as for instance in that of a<br>dying man, an unborn babe, or an idiot—complete absence of freedom, by<br>so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are<br>examining, for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man. And<br>so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of<br>inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as<br>the conception of a man’s completely free action.<br><br>And so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of<br>inevitability without any freedom, we must assume the knowledge of an<br>infinite number of space relations, an infinitely long period of time,<br>and an infinite series of causes.<br><br>To imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of<br>inevitability, we must imagine him all alone, beyond space, beyond time,<br>and free from dependence on cause.<br><br>In the first case, if inevitability were possible without freedom<br>we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of<br>inevitability itself, that is, a mere form without content.<br><br>In the second case, if freedom were possible without inevitability we<br>should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space, time, and<br>cause, which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would<br>be nothing, or mere content without form.<br><br>We should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man’s<br>whole outlook on the universe is constructed—the incomprehensible<br>essence of life, and the laws defining that essence.<br><br>Reason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give it<br>visibility is infinite, and cannot be imagined otherwise. (2) Time is<br>infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise.<br>(3) The connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can<br>have no end.<br><br>Consciousness says: (1) I alone am, and all that exists is but me,<br>consequently I include space. (2) I measure flowing time by the fixed<br>moment of the present in which alone I am conscious of myself as living,<br>consequently I am outside time. (3) I am beyond cause, for I feel myself<br>to be the cause of every manifestation of my life.<br><br>Reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability. Consciousness<br>gives expression to the essence of freedom.<br><br>Freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life, in man’s<br>consciousness. Inevitability without content is man’s reason in its<br>three forms.<br><br>Freedom is the thing examined. Inevitability is what examines. Freedom<br>is the content. Inevitability is the form.<br><br>Only by separating the two sources of cognition, related to one another<br>as form to content, do we get the mutually exclusive and separately<br>incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability.<br><br>Only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man’s life.<br><br>Apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one<br>another as form and content, no conception of life is possible.<br><br>All that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free<br>will to inevitability, that is, of consciousness to the laws of reason.<br><br>All that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain<br>relation of the forces of nature to inevitability, or of the essence of<br>life to the laws of reason.<br><br>The great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of<br>them; we call those forces gravitation, inertia, electricity, animal<br>force, and so on, but we are conscious of the force of life in man and<br>we call that freedom.<br><br>But just as the force of gravitation, incomprehensible in itself but<br>felt by every man, is understood by us only to the extent to which we<br>know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the first<br>knowledge that all bodies have weight, up to Newton’s law), so too the<br>force of free will, incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is<br>conscious, is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of<br>inevitability to which it is subject (from the fact that every man dies,<br>up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws).<br><br>All knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the<br>laws of reason.<br><br>Man’s free will differs from every other force in that man is directly<br>conscious of it, but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from<br>any other force. The forces of gravitation, electricity, or chemical<br>affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are<br>differently defined by reason. Just so the force of man’s free will<br>is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the<br>definition reason gives it. Freedom, apart from necessity, that is,<br>apart from the laws of reason that define it, differs in no way from<br>gravitation, or heat, or the force that makes things grow; for reason,<br>it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life.<br><br>And as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies,<br>the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity, or<br>of chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms the content of<br>astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and so on, just in the<br>same way does the force of free will form the content of history.<br>But just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this<br>unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the<br>subject of metaphysics, even the manifestation of the force of free will<br>in human beings in space, in time, and in dependence on cause forms<br>the subject of history, while free will itself is the subject of<br>metaphysics.<br><br>In the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of<br>inevitability, what is unknown to us we call vital force. Vital force is<br>only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know<br>of the essence of life.<br><br>So also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability,<br>what is unknown we call free will. Free will is for history only an<br>expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of<br>human life.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XI<br><br>History examines the manifestations of man’s free will in connection<br>with the external world in time and in dependence on cause, that is, it<br>defines this freedom by the laws of reason, and so history is a science<br>only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws.<br><br>The recognition of man’s free will as something capable of influencing<br>historical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for<br>history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies<br>would be for astronomy.<br><br>That assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws,<br>that is, of any science whatever. If there is even a single body<br>moving freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no<br>conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists. If<br>any single action is due to free will, then not a single historical law<br>can exist, nor any conception of historical events.<br><br>For history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end<br>of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a<br>consciousness of man’s will in the present moves in space, time, and<br>dependence on cause.<br><br>The more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more<br>evident are the laws of that movement. To discover and define those laws<br>is the problem of history.<br><br>From the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its<br>subject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events in<br>man’s free will, a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible,<br>for however man’s free will may be restricted, as soon as we recognize<br>it as a force not subject to law, the existence of law becomes<br>impossible.<br><br>Only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, that<br>is, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we convince<br>ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes, and then<br>instead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery of laws as<br>its problem.<br><br>The search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of<br>thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously<br>with the self-destruction toward which—ever dissecting and dissecting<br>the causes of phenomena—the old method of history is moving.<br><br>All human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at<br>infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the<br>process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration<br>of unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception<br>of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all<br>unknown, infinitely small, elements.<br><br>In another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences<br>have proceeded. When Newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say<br>that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction; he said that all<br>bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting<br>one another, that is, leaving aside the question of the cause of the<br>movement of the bodies, he expressed the property common to all bodies<br>from the infinitely large to the infinitely small. The same is done by<br>the natural sciences: leaving aside the question of cause, they seek for<br>laws. History stands on the same path. And if history has for its object<br>the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the<br>narration of episodes in the lives of individuals, it too, setting<br>aside the conception of cause, should seek the laws common to all the<br>inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will.<br><br><br><br><br><br>CHAPTER XII<br><br>From the time the law of Copernicus was discovered and proved, the mere<br>recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves<br>sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients. By disproving<br>that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of<br>the movements of the bodies, but without disproving it, it would seem<br>impossible to continue studying the Ptolemaic worlds. But even after<br>the discovery of the law of Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still<br>studied for a long time.<br><br>From the time the first person said and proved that the number of births<br>or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws, and that this or that<br>mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic<br>conditions, and that certain relations of population to soil produce<br>migrations of peoples, the foundations on which history had been built<br>were destroyed in their essence.<br><br>By refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been<br>retained; but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue<br>studying historic events as the results of man’s free will. For if a<br>certain mode of government was established or certain migrations<br>of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic,<br>ethnographic, or economic conditions, then the free will of those<br>individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government<br>or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause.<br><br>And yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the<br>laws of statistics, geography, political economy, comparative philology,<br>and geology, which directly contradict its assumptions.<br><br>The struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly<br>fought out in physical philosophy. Theology stood on guard for the<br>old views and accused the new of violating revelation. But when truth<br>conquered, theology established itself just as firmly on the new<br>foundation.<br><br>Just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between<br>the old and the new conception of history, and theology in the same way<br>stands on guard for the old view, and accuses the new view of subverting<br>revelation.<br><br>In the one case as in the other, on both sides the struggle provokes<br>passion and stifles truth. On the one hand there is fear and regret for<br>the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages, on the other<br>is the passion for destruction.<br><br>To the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy,<br>it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in<br>God, in the creation of the firmament, and in the miracle of Joshua the<br>son of Nun. To the defenders of the laws of Copernicus and Newton, to<br>Voltaire for example, it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed<br>religion, and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against<br>religion.<br><br>Just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of<br>inevitability, to destroy the conception of the soul, of good and evil,<br>and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on<br>those conceptions.<br><br>So too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited defenders of the law of<br>inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion, though<br>the law of inevitability in history, like the law of Copernicus in<br>astronomy, far from destroying, even strengthens the foundation on which<br>the institutions of state and church are erected.<br><br>As in the question of astronomy then, so in the question of history<br>now, the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or<br>nonrecognition of something absolute, serving as the measure of visible<br>phenomena. In astronomy it was the immovability of the earth, in history<br>it is the independence of personality—free will.<br><br>As with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth<br>lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earth’s fixity and of<br>the motion of the planets, so in history the difficulty of recognizing<br>the subjection of personality to the laws of space, time, and cause<br>lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of one’s own<br>personality. But as in astronomy the new view said: “It is true that we<br>do not feel the movement of the earth, but by admitting its immobility<br>we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting its motion (which we do not<br>feel) we arrive at laws,” so also in history the new view says: “It is<br>true that we are not conscious of our dependence, but by admitting our<br>free will we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting our dependence on<br>the external world, on time, and on cause, we arrive at laws.”<br><br>In the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an<br>unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel;<br>in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom<br>that does not exist, and to recognize a dependence of which we are not<br>conscious.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy<br><br>*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WAR AND PEACE ***<br><br>***** This file should be named 2600-0.txt or 2600-0.zip ***** This and<br>all associated files of various formats will be found in:        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/6/0/2600/<br><br>An Anonymous Volunteer, and David Widger<br><br><br>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be<br>renamed.<br><br>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one<br>owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and<br>you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission<br>and without paying copyright royalties.
