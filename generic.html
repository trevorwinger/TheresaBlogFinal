									<h1>Leaving Grief at Heaven's Gate</h1>
									<p>Leaving Grief at Heaven's Gate is a collection of grace filled meditations based on The Holy Scriptures.<br/>
									This book aims to offer hope for healing the broken heart through Jesus Christ.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/champ2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Counseling hurting people who have encountered loss has given me inspiration to dig deeper into God's Word for wisdom. Jesus has dispelled the powers of grief and
									provided His protection and provision when it knocks on the door of one’s
									heart. Grief does not have the upper hand when loss arrives. In fact, grief
									has not been allowed into the gates of Heaven. Therefore, as believers in Jesus Christ
									who are now living in the Kingdom of God, grief has no right to possess our hearts.</p>
								<p>Through the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ on the cross, grief
 									has been left outside the gates of Heaven. By the gift of the Holy Spirit, believers
 									are partakers of Christ’s resurrected life; which includes peace and excludes
 									grief. </p>
									<p>Since grief is not a promise of Jesus, but His peace, comfort and healing, why are
 									believers welcoming grief into their lives?</p>
									<p>Savor each promise presented in Leaving Grief at Heaven’s Gate and receive the
 									grace which overrules grief in your heart today. </p>
