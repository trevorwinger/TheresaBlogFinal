His parents were very hard-working<br>and deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five<br>children in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings<br>in reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious<br>character.<br><br>Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the<br>final examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had<br>already begun his first work, “Poor Folk.”<br><br>This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and<br>was received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself<br>instantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career<br>seemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he<br>was arrested.<br><br>Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky<br>was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier<br>and Proudhon. He was accused of “taking part in conversations against<br>the censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of<br>knowing of the intention to set up a printing press.” Under Nicholas<br>I. (that “stern and just man,” as Maurice Baring calls him) this was<br>enough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months’ imprisonment<br>he was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to<br>be shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: “They snapped<br>words over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by<br>persons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,<br>to suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only<br>a few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and<br>I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to<br>bid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,<br>brought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared<br>us our lives.” The sentence was commuted to hard labour.<br><br>One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and<br>never regained his sanity.<br><br>The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on<br>Dostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to<br>accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing<br>in his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.<br>He describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the<br>cruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal<br>servitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where<br>he began the “Dead House,” and some years of service in a disciplinary<br>battalion.<br><br>He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest<br>and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he<br>suffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times<br>a year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was<br>allowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--“Vremya,” which was<br>forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost<br>his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet<br>he took upon himself the payment of his brother’s debts. He started<br>another journal--“The Epoch,” which within a few months was also<br>prohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was<br>dependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is<br>said never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were<br>much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.<br><br>In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the<br>monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary<br>demonstrations of love and honour.<br><br>A few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a<br>vast multitude of mourners, who “gave the hapless man the funeral of a<br>king.” He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.<br><br>In the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling<br>inspired by Dostoevsky: “He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and<br>our bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than<br>we have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart<br>which we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other<br>gifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he<br>became great.”<br><br><br><br><br><br>CRIME AND PUNISHMENT<br><br><br><br><br>PART I<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of<br>the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though<br>in hesitation, towards K. bridge.<br><br>He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His<br>garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more<br>like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,<br>dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time<br>he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which<br>invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a<br>sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was<br>hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.<br><br>This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but<br>for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,<br>verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in<br>himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not<br>only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the<br>anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had<br>given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all<br>desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror<br>for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her<br>trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats<br>and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to<br>lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and<br>slip out unseen.<br><br>This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely<br>aware of his fears.<br><br>“I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these<br>trifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm... yes, all is in a man’s<br>hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would<br>be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new<br>step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking<br>too much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is<br>that I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this<br>last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the<br>Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is<br>_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse<br>myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”<br><br>The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle<br>and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that<br>special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out<br>of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man’s already<br>overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which<br>are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men<br>whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed<br>the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest<br>disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was,<br>by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,<br>well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank<br>into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness<br>of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring<br>to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the<br>habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these<br>moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a<br>tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted<br>food.<br><br>He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would<br>have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter<br>of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have<br>created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number<br>of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading<br>and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the<br>heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets<br>that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was<br>such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that,<br>in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least<br>of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with<br>acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked<br>meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown<br>reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy<br>dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: “Hey there, German<br>hatter” bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young<br>man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall<br>round hat from Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all<br>torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly<br>fashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror<br>had overtaken him.<br><br>“I knew it,” he muttered in confusion, “I thought so! That’s the worst<br>of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might<br>spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd<br>and that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any<br>sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such<br>a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What<br>matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them<br>a clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as<br>possible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it’s just such<br>trifles that always ruin everything....”<br><br>He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate<br>of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted<br>them once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no<br>faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous<br>but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon<br>them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at<br>his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard<br>this “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he<br>still did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a<br>“rehearsal” of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more<br>and more violent.<br><br>With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house<br>which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the<br>street. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by<br>working people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of<br>sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.<br>There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the<br>two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on<br>the building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and<br>at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the<br>staircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar<br>with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:<br>in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.<br><br>“If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that<br>I were really going to do it?” he could not help asking himself as he<br>reached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters<br>who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the<br>flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his<br>family. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this<br>staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. “That’s a good<br>thing anyway,” he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old<br>woman’s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of<br>tin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells<br>that ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now<br>its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it<br>clearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained<br>by now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old<br>woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and<br>nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.<br>But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and<br>opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which<br>was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing<br>him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,<br>withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp<br>little nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared<br>with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,<br>which looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,<br>and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy<br>fur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every<br>instant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar<br>expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.<br><br>“Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,” the young man made<br>haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more<br>polite.<br><br>“I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,” the<br>old woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.<br><br>“And here... I am again on the same errand,” Raskolnikov continued, a<br>little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust. “Perhaps<br>she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other<br>time,” he thought with an uneasy feeling.<br><br>The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,<br>and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass<br>in front of her:<br><br>“Step in, my good sir.”<br><br>The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on<br>the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly<br>lighted up at that moment by the setting sun.<br><br>“So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!” flashed as it were by<br>chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned<br>everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and<br>remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The<br>furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with<br>a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a<br>dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,<br>chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow<br>frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was<br>all. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything<br>was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;<br>everything shone.<br><br>“Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust<br>to be seen in the whole flat.<br><br>“It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such<br>cleanliness,” Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance<br>at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in<br>which stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he<br>had never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.<br><br>“What do you want?” the old woman said severely, coming into the room<br>and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in<br>the face.<br><br>“I’ve brought something to pawn here,” and he drew out of his pocket<br>an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a<br>globe; the chain was of steel.<br><br>“But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day<br>before yesterday.”<br><br>“I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.”<br><br>“But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell<br>your pledge at once.”<br><br>“How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”<br><br>“You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything.<br>I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it<br>quite new at a jeweler’s for a rouble and a half.”<br><br>“Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father’s. I<br>shall be getting some money soon.”<br><br>“A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!”<br><br>“A rouble and a half!” cried the young man.<br><br>“Please yourself”--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The<br>young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going<br>away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere<br>else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.<br><br>“Hand it over,” he said roughly.<br><br>The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind<br>the curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in<br>the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear<br>her unlocking the chest of drawers.<br><br>“It must be the top drawer,” he reflected. “So she carries the keys in<br>a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there’s<br>one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;<br>that can’t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some<br>other chest or strong-box... that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always<br>have keys like that... but how degrading it all is.”<br><br>The old woman came back.<br><br>“Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take<br>fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But<br>for the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks<br>on the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks<br>altogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the<br>watch. Here it is.”<br><br>“What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!”<br><br>“Just so.”<br><br>The young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the<br>old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still<br>something he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know<br>what.<br><br>“I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona<br>Ivanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it<br>back from a friend...” he broke off in confusion.<br><br>“Well, we will talk about it then, sir.”<br><br>“Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with<br>you?” He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the<br>passage.<br><br>“What business is she of yours, my good sir?”<br><br>“Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day,<br>Alyona Ivanovna.”<br><br>Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more<br>and more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two<br>or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was<br>in the street he cried out, “Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and<br>can I, can I possibly.... No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!” he added<br>resolutely. “And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?<br>What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,<br>disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I’ve been....”<br> But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling<br>of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart<br>while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a<br>pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to<br>do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the<br>pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling<br>against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next<br>street. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern<br>which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.<br>At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and<br>supporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to<br>think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had<br>never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a<br>burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his<br>sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little<br>table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank<br>off the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became<br>clear.<br><br>“All that’s nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there is nothing in it<br>all to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. Just a glass of<br>beer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,<br>the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all<br>is!”<br><br>But in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful<br>as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed<br>round in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that<br>moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also<br>not normal.<br><br>There were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken<br>men he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and<br>a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure<br>left the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern<br>were a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,<br>sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with<br>a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had<br>dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in<br>his sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper<br>part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some<br>meaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:<br><br>   “His wife a year he fondly loved<br>    His wife a--a year he--fondly loved.”<br><br>Or suddenly waking up again:<br><br>   “Walking along the crowded row<br>    He met the one he used to know.”<br><br>But no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with<br>positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was<br>another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government<br>clerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and<br>looking round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided<br>society of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he<br>felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking<br>place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He<br>was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy<br>excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other<br>world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the<br>surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.<br><br>The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently<br>came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with<br>red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his<br>person. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,<br>with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an<br>iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was<br>another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the<br>counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and<br>some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably<br>close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such<br>an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.<br><br>There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the<br>first moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on<br>Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked<br>like a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression<br>afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly<br>at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring<br>persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At<br>the other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk<br>looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing<br>a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and<br>culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to<br>converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,<br>and stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of<br>a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen<br>reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very<br>strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense<br>feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the<br>same time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an<br>old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing<br>except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this<br>last trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots<br>and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore<br>no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin<br>looked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable<br>and like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he<br>ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his<br>hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky<br>table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and<br>resolutely:<br><br>“May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?<br>Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my<br>experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not<br>accustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in<br>conjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular<br>counsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. I<br>make bold to inquire--have you been in the service?”<br><br>“No, I am studying,” answered the young man, somewhat surprised at<br>the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly<br>addressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for<br>company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his<br>habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached<br>or attempted to approach him.<br><br>“A student then, or formerly a student,” cried the clerk. “Just what<br>I thought! I’m a man of experience, immense experience, sir,” and he<br>tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. “You’ve been a<br>student or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me....”<br> He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside<br>the young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke<br>fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his<br>sentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as<br>greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.<br><br>“Honoured sir,” he began almost with solemnity, “poverty is not a vice,<br>that’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,<br>and that that’s even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a<br>vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but<br>in beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human<br>society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as<br>humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary<br>I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!<br>Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and<br>my wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me<br>to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent<br>a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?”<br><br>“No, I have not happened to,” answered Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”<br><br>“Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve slept<br>so....” He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in<br>fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite<br>probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.<br>His hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black<br>nails.<br><br>His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The<br>boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the<br>upper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the “funny fellow”<br> and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.<br>Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most<br>likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of<br>frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in<br>the tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and<br>especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order<br>at home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify<br>themselves and even if possible obtain consideration.<br><br>“Funny fellow!” pronounced the innkeeper. “And why don’t you work, why<br>aren’t you at your duty, if you are in the service?”<br><br>“Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,” Marmeladov went on, addressing<br>himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put<br>that question to him. “Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache<br>to think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov<br>beat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I suffer?<br>Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to<br>petition hopelessly for a loan?”<br><br>“Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?”<br><br>“Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you<br>will get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive<br>certainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will<br>on no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?<br>For he knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compassion? But<br>Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day<br>that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that’s<br>what is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I<br>ask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that<br>he won’t, I set off to him and...”<br><br>“Why do you go?” put in Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must<br>have somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must<br>go somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,<br>then I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport),” he added<br>in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.<br>“No matter, sir, no matter!” he went on hurriedly and with apparent<br>composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the<br>innkeeper smiled--“No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of<br>their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all<br>that is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but<br>with humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Excuse me, young<br>man, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not<br>_can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?”<br><br>The young man did not answer a word.<br><br>“Well,” the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,<br>after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. “Well, so be<br>it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but<br>Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer’s<br>daughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a<br>noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,<br>if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man<br>ought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina<br>Ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although<br>I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for<br>I repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,” he<br>declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--“but, my<br>God, if she would but once.... But no, no! It’s all in vain and it’s no<br>use talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come true<br>and more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a<br>beast by nature!”<br><br>“Rather!” assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist<br>resolutely on the table.<br><br>“Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very<br>stockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the<br>order of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!<br>Her mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own<br>property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this<br>winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three<br>little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till<br>night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she’s<br>been used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has<br>a tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don’t feel it?<br>And the more I drink the more I feel it. That’s why I drink too. I try<br>to find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer<br>twice as much!” And as though in despair he laid his head down on the<br>table.<br><br>“Young man,” he went on, raising his head again, “in your face I seem to<br>read some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why<br>I addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I<br>do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,<br>who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man<br>of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a<br>high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she<br>danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for<br>which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.<br>The medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the<br>certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed<br>it to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms<br>with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past<br>honours and of the happy days that are gone. I don’t condemn her for<br>it, I don’t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of<br>the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady<br>of spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has<br>nothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treated<br>with disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s<br>rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to<br>her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was<br>a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the<br>other. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and<br>ran away with him from her father’s house. She was exceedingly fond of<br>her husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he<br>died. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of<br>which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of<br>him with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad<br>that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having<br>once been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in<br>a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she<br>was left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups<br>and downs of all sort, I don’t feel equal to describing it even. Her<br>relations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively<br>proud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a<br>widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered<br>her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can<br>judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education<br>and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my<br>wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she<br>married me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you<br>understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,<br>that you don’t understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed<br>my duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this” (he<br>tapped the jug with his finger), “for I have feelings. But even so, I<br>could not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no<br>fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch<br>it!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at<br>last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent<br>capital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a<br>situation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This<br>time it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come<br>out.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s;<br>and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.<br>There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and<br>disorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by<br>my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with<br>from her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of. For,<br>though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited<br>lady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it’s no use going over<br>that! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an<br>effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal<br>history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we<br>had no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not<br>even those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at<br>Cyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read<br>other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great<br>interest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes’ Physiology--do<br>you know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that’s the<br>whole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured<br>sir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that<br>a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen<br>farthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special<br>talent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what’s<br>more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of<br>him?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she<br>made him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the<br>pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were<br>put in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina<br>Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed<br>red, as they always are in that disease: ‘Here you live with us,’ says<br>she, ‘you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.’<br>And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the<br>little ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what of<br>it! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle<br>creature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin<br>little face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing<br>like that?’ And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very<br>well known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her<br>through the landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,<br>‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!’ But don’t blame<br>her, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t blame her! She was not herself<br>when she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying<br>of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything<br>else.... For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when children<br>cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o’clock<br>I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the<br>room and about nine o’clock she came back. She walked straight up to<br>Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her<br>in silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she<br>simply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,<br>made of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down<br>on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her<br>body kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....<br>And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence<br>go up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening<br>kissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell<br>asleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay<br>drunk.”<br><br>Marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then he<br>hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.<br><br>“Since then, sir,” he went on after a brief pause--“Since then, owing<br>to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by<br>evil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a<br>leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of<br>respect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take<br>a yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with<br>us. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though<br>she had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...<br>hm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s<br>account. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of<br>a sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, ‘can a highly educated<br>man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?’ And Katerina<br>Ivanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that’s<br>how it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she<br>comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room<br>at the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is<br>a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft<br>palates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one<br>room, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor<br>people and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,<br>and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his<br>excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you<br>know him? No? Well, then, it’s a man of God you don’t know. He is wax...<br>wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were<br>dim when he heard my story. ‘Marmeladov, once already you have<br>deceived my expectations... I’ll take you once more on my own<br>responsibility’--that’s what he said, ‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now you<br>can go.’ I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality<br>he would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of<br>modern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when I<br>announced that I’d been taken back into the service and should receive a<br>salary, heavens, what a to-do there was!...”<br><br>Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a whole<br>party of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds<br>of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven<br>singing “The Hamlet” were heard in the entry. The room was filled with<br>noise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.<br>Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.<br>He appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more<br>drunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of his<br>recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was<br>positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikov<br>listened attentively.<br><br>“That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna<br>and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the<br>kingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but<br>abuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ‘Semyon<br>Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!’<br>They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They<br>began to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managed<br>to get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty<br>copecks, I can’t guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,<br>a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and<br>a half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina<br>Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with<br>horse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any<br>dresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going<br>on a visit; and not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened<br>herself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on a<br>clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different<br>person, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,<br>had only helped with money ‘for the time,’ she said, ‘it won’t do for me<br>to come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.’ Do<br>you hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you<br>think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with<br>our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not<br>resist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,<br>whispering together. ‘Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,<br>now, and receiving a salary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his<br>excellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the<br>others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into<br>his study.’ Do you hear, do you hear? ‘To be sure,’ says he, ‘Semyon<br>Zaharovitch, remembering your past services,’ says he, ‘and in spite<br>of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and<br>since moreover we’ve got on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you<br>hear;) ‘and so,’ says he, ‘I rely now on your word as a gentleman.’ And<br>all that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not<br>simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it<br>all herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she<br>does! And I don’t blame her for it, no, I don’t blame her!... Six days<br>ago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles<br>forty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said she,<br>‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by ourselves, you understand?<br>You would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a<br>husband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’<br>said she.”<br><br>Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began<br>to twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degraded<br>appearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of<br>spirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered<br>his listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.<br>He felt vexed that he had come here.<br><br>“Honoured sir, honoured sir,” cried Marmeladov recovering himself--“Oh,<br>sir, perhaps all this seems a laughing matter to you, as it does to<br>others, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the<br>trivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.<br>For I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life<br>and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would<br>arrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should<br>give her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour<br>and restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....<br>Quite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir” (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort<br>of start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) “well, on<br>the very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five<br>days ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,<br>I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was<br>left of my earnings, how much it was I have forgotten, and now look<br>at me, all of you! It’s the fifth day since I left home, and they are<br>looking for me there and it’s the end of my employment, and my uniform<br>is lying in a tavern on the Egyptian bridge. I exchanged it for the<br>garments I have on... and it’s the end of everything!”<br><br>Marmeladov struck his forehead with his fist, clenched his teeth, closed<br>his eyes and leaned heavily with his elbow on the table. But a minute<br>later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and<br>affectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:<br><br>“This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!<br>He-he-he!”<br><br>“You don’t say she gave it to you?” cried one of the new-comers; he<br>shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.<br><br>“This very quart was bought with her money,” Marmeladov declared,<br>addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. “Thirty copecks she gave<br>me with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said<br>nothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up<br>yonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them,<br>they don’t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don’t<br>blame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do<br>you think, my dear sir? For now she’s got to keep up her appearance. It<br>costs money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you<br>understand? And there’s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;<br>petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her<br>foot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you<br>understand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,<br>here I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking<br>it! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like<br>me, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry<br>or not? He-he-he!”<br><br>He would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot was<br>empty.<br><br>“What are you to be pitied for?” shouted the tavern-keeper who was again<br>near them.<br><br>Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths<br>came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard<br>nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged<br>government clerk.<br><br>“To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?” Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,<br>standing up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only<br>waiting for that question.<br><br>“Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there’s nothing to pity me for! I<br>ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me,<br>oh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be<br>crucified, for it’s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...<br>Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been<br>sweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and<br>tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity<br>us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all<br>things, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day<br>and He will ask: ‘Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,<br>consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is<br>the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,<br>undismayed by his beastliness?’ And He will say, ‘Come to me! I have<br>already forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins<br>which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....’ And he<br>will forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my<br>heart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgive<br>all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He has<br>done with all of them, then He will summon us. ‘You too come forth,’<br>He will say, ‘Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come<br>forth, ye children of shame!’ And we shall all come forth, without shame<br>and shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are swine, made<br>in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!’ And the<br>wise ones and those of understanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thou<br>receive these men?’ And He will say, ‘This is why I receive them, oh ye<br>wise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one<br>of them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ And He will hold out His<br>hands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...<br>and we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and<br>all will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....<br>Lord, Thy kingdom come!” And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and<br>helpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings<br>and plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;<br>there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard<br>again.<br><br>“That’s his notion!”<br><br>“Talked himself silly!”<br><br>“A fine clerk he is!”<br><br>And so on, and so on.<br><br>“Let us go, sir,” said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and<br>addressing Raskolnikov--“come along with me... Kozel’s house, looking<br>into the yard. I’m going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did.”<br><br>Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to<br>help him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech<br>and leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundred<br>paces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and<br>confusion as they drew nearer the house.<br><br>“It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,” he muttered in<br>agitation--“and that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair<br>matter! Bother my hair! That’s what I say! Indeed it will be better if<br>she does begin pulling it, that’s not what I am afraid of... it’s her<br>eyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,<br>frightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people<br>in that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of<br>the children’s crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...<br>I don’t know what’s happened! I don’t know! But blows I am not afraid<br>of.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an<br>enjoyment. In fact I can’t get on without it.... It’s better so. Let<br>her strike me, it relieves her heart... it’s better so... There is the<br>house. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.<br>Lead the way!”<br><br>They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase<br>got darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven o’clock<br>and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was<br>quite dark at the top of the stairs.<br><br>A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A very<br>poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;<br>the whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,<br>littered up with rags of all sorts, especially children’s garments.<br>Across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it<br>probably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs<br>and a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which<br>stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edge<br>of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It<br>appeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,<br>but their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the other<br>rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel’s flat was<br>divided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter<br>within. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words<br>of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.<br><br>Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,<br>slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown<br>hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down<br>in her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips<br>were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes<br>glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And<br>that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the<br>candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to<br>Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for<br>Marmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.<br>She seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room<br>was close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the<br>staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner<br>rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not<br>close the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting<br>curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older<br>stood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a<br>beating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,<br>wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung<br>over her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.<br>Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother’s neck. She was<br>trying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she<br>could to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her large<br>dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened<br>face, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the<br>door, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov<br>in front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently<br>facing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what<br>he had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into<br>the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking no<br>further notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it<br>and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the<br>doorway.<br><br>“Ah!” she cried out in a frenzy, “he has come back! The criminal! the<br>monster!... And where is the money? What’s in your pocket, show me! And<br>your clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the<br>money! Speak!”<br><br>And she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently<br>held up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.<br><br>“Where is the money?” she cried--“Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?<br>There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!” and in a fury<br>she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov<br>seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.<br><br>“And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a<br>positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,” he called out, shaken to and<br>fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.<br>The child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the<br>corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed<br>to his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was<br>shaking like a leaf.<br><br>“He’s drunk it! he’s drunk it all,” the poor woman screamed in<br>despair--“and his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!”--and<br>wringing her hands she pointed to the children. “Oh, accursed life!<br>And you, are you not ashamed?”--she pounced all at once upon<br>Raskolnikov--“from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have<br>been drinking with him, too! Go away!”<br><br>The young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door<br>was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse<br>laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust<br>themselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in<br>dressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of<br>them with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, when<br>Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation<br>to him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill<br>outcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her<br>way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and<br>for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her<br>with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,<br>Raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the<br>coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to<br>lay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changed<br>his mind and would have gone back.<br><br>“What a stupid thing I’ve done,” he thought to himself, “they have Sonia<br>and I want it myself.” But reflecting that it would be impossible to<br>take it back now and that in any case he would not have taken it, he<br>dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.<br>“Sonia wants pomatum too,” he said as he walked along the street, and he<br>laughed malignantly--“such smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Sonia<br>herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting<br>big game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust<br>to-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they’ve dug<br>there! And they’re making the most of it! Yes, they are making the most<br>of it! They’ve wept over it and grown used to it. Man grows used to<br>everything, the scoundrel!”<br><br>He sank into thought.<br><br>“And what if I am wrong,” he cried suddenly after a moment’s thought.<br>“What if man is not really a scoundrel, man in general, I mean, the<br>whole race of mankind--then all the rest is prejudice, simply artificial<br>terrors and there are no barriers and it’s all as it should be.”<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>He waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had not<br>refreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked<br>with hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six<br>paces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty<br>yellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man<br>of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment<br>that he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in<br>keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a<br>painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;<br>the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long<br>untouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and<br>half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but<br>was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep<br>on it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old<br>student’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he<br>heaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. A<br>little table stood in front of the sofa.<br><br>It would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to<br>Raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.<br>He had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,<br>and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked<br>sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He was<br>in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated<br>upon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending<br>him in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,<br>though he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,<br>was rather pleased at the lodger’s mood and had entirely given up<br>sweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into<br>his room with a broom. She waked him up that day.<br><br>“Get up, why are you asleep?” she called to him. “It’s past nine, I have<br>brought you some tea; will you have a cup? I should think you’re fairly<br>starving?”<br><br>Raskolnikov opened his eyes, started and recognised Nastasya.<br><br>“From the landlady, eh?” he asked, slowly and with a sickly face sitting<br>up on the sofa.<br><br>“From the landlady, indeed!”<br><br>She set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and<br>laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it.<br><br>“Here, Nastasya, take it please,” he said, fumbling in his pocket (for<br>he had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--“run<br>and buy me a loaf. And get me a little sausage, the cheapest, at the<br>pork-butcher’s.”<br><br>“The loaf I’ll fetch you this very minute, but wouldn’t you rather have<br>some cabbage soup instead of sausage? It’s capital soup, yesterday’s. I<br>saved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. It’s fine soup.”<br><br>When the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya<br>sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting. She was a country<br>peasant-woman and a very talkative one.<br><br>“Praskovya Pavlovna means to complain to the police about you,” she<br>said.<br><br>He scowled.<br><br>“To the police? What does she want?”<br><br>“You don’t pay her money and you won’t turn out of the room. That’s what<br>she wants, to be sure.”<br><br>“The devil, that’s the last straw,” he muttered, grinding his teeth,<br>“no, that would not suit me... just now. She is a fool,” he added aloud.<br>“I’ll go and talk to her to-day.”<br><br>“Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you are so<br>clever, do you lie here like a sack and have nothing to show for it? One<br>time you used to go out, you say, to teach children. But why is it you<br>do nothing now?”<br><br>“I am doing...” Raskolnikov began sullenly and reluctantly.<br><br>“What are you doing?”<br><br>“Work...”<br><br>“What sort of work?”<br><br>“I am thinking,” he answered seriously after a pause.<br><br>Nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was given to laughter<br>and when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and<br>shaking all over till she felt ill.<br><br>“And have you made much money by your thinking?” she managed to<br>articulate at last.<br><br>“One can’t go out to give lessons without boots. And I’m sick of it.”<br><br>“Don’t quarrel with your bread and butter.”<br><br>“They pay so little for lessons. What’s the use of a few coppers?” he<br>answered, reluctantly, as though replying to his own thought.<br><br>“And you want to get a fortune all at once?”<br><br>He looked at her strangely.<br><br>“Yes, I want a fortune,” he answered firmly, after a brief pause.<br><br>“Don’t be in such a hurry, you quite frighten me! Shall I get you the<br>loaf or not?”<br><br>“As you please.”<br><br>“Ah, I forgot! A letter came for you yesterday when you were out.”<br><br>“A letter? for me! from whom?”<br><br>“I can’t say. I gave three copecks of my own to the postman for it. Will<br>you pay me back?”<br><br>“Then bring it to me, for God’s sake, bring it,” cried Raskolnikov<br>greatly excited--“good God!”<br><br>A minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother,<br>from the province of R----. He turned pale when he took it. It was a<br>long while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also<br>suddenly stabbed his heart.<br><br>“Nastasya, leave me alone, for goodness’ sake; here are your three<br>copecks, but for goodness’ sake, make haste and go!”<br><br>The letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her<br>presence; he wanted to be left _alone_ with this letter. When Nastasya<br>had gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he<br>gazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear<br>and familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.<br>He delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;<br>it was a thick heavy letter, weighing over two ounces, two large sheets<br>of note paper were covered with very small handwriting.<br><br>“My dear Rodya,” wrote his mother--“it’s two months since I last had a<br>talk with you by letter which has distressed me and even kept me<br>awake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for my<br>inevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to look<br>to, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What a<br>grief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university<br>some months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had<br>lost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of my<br>hundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent<br>you four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,<br>from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is a<br>kind-hearted man and was a friend of your father’s too. But having given<br>him the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was<br>paid off and that is only just done, so that I’ve been unable to send<br>you anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shall<br>be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate<br>ourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. In<br>the first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister<br>has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be<br>separated in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will<br>tell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything<br>has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When you<br>wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great<br>deal to put up with in the Svidrigaïlovs’ house, when you wrote that<br>and asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to<br>you? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have<br>thrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all<br>the way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not<br>let your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I<br>do? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What<br>made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles<br>in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on<br>condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it<br>was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.<br>This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took<br>chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly<br>then and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,<br>writing that this money came from Dounia’s savings, but that was not<br>so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have<br>suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves<br>you and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated<br>her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at<br>table.... But I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as<br>not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite<br>of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s<br>wife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,<br>especially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimental<br>habits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it<br>was all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had<br>conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed<br>it under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and<br>horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and<br>his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.<br>And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide<br>the truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face<br>to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of<br>inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her<br>to another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went<br>through! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on<br>account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa<br>Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia<br>would have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would<br>have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been<br>inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could<br>not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know<br>Dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she<br>has. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases<br>she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write<br>to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were<br>constantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa<br>Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the<br>garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw<br>the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful<br>scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna<br>went so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was<br>shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should<br>be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which they<br>flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without<br>folding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,<br>and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an<br>open cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer<br>could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and<br>what could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to<br>you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified<br>and indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin<br>yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter<br>with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a<br>whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came<br>to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account<br>of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about<br>us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the<br>street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to<br>insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,<br>so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set<br>going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at<br>her in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that<br>month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is<br>rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and<br>particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not<br>at all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in<br>the town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but<br>Dounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how<br>she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is<br>an angel! But by God’s mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.<br>Svidrigaïlov returned to his senses and repented and, probably<br>feeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and<br>unmistakable proof of Dounia’s innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia<br>had been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna<br>came upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.<br>Svidrigaïlov’s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse<br>personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating<br>her. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation<br>for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding<br>him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how<br>infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,<br>unhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and<br>touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot<br>read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,<br>cleared Dounia’s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more<br>than Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case<br>with servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and ‘again<br>crushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of<br>Dounia’s innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight<br>to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give<br>her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she<br>came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept<br>bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to<br>forgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all<br>the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in<br>the most flattering terms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility of<br>her feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to<br>everyone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and<br>even allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was<br>superfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about<br>the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence<br>having been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so<br>that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone<br>knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the<br>letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading<br>of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their<br>own houses and in other people’s. In my opinion a great deal, a very<br>great deal of all this was unnecessary; but that’s Marfa Petrovna’s<br>character. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia’s<br>reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible<br>disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really<br>began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too<br>harshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,<br>but she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked<br>respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may<br>say, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,<br>that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry<br>him. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been<br>arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved<br>with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we<br>could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you<br>could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This<br>was how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr<br>Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who<br>has been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his<br>expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was<br>properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent<br>us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a<br>speedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry<br>to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,<br>of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly<br>and unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a<br>well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government<br>and has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years<br>old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be<br>thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and<br>presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.<br>But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.<br>And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will<br>do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if<br>there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this<br>warning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression<br>upon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be<br>deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,<br>which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr<br>Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.<br>At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but<br>still he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions ‘of our<br>most rising generation’ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He<br>said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be<br>listened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very<br>little of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man<br>of great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know<br>your sister’s character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and<br>generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.<br>Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but<br>Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make<br>it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her<br>happiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it<br>must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he<br>is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that<br>his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with<br>him. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even<br>certain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in<br>the happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she<br>relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and<br>that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future<br>relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,<br>for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come<br>from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For<br>instance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia’s consent,<br>in the course of conversation, he declared that before making<br>Dounia’s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of<br>good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced<br>poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his<br>wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her<br>benefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely<br>than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only<br>remember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,<br>but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards<br>to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike<br>me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was<br>vexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ and that, of course, is<br>perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up<br>her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was<br>walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before<br>the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me<br>that she had decided.<br><br>“I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for<br>Petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open<br>a legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil<br>and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important<br>case. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before<br>the Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in<br>every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day<br>you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that<br>your future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to<br>pass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a<br>providential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even<br>ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.<br>He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not<br>get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to<br>a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the<br>duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then<br>he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave<br>you time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but<br>Dounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever<br>for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for<br>your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr<br>Petrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you are a<br>student of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share<br>all her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of<br>realising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch’s evasiveness, very<br>natural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly<br>persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her<br>future husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful<br>not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,<br>especially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might<br>take this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor<br>has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have<br>of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken<br>of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,<br>later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of<br>himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since<br>you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and<br>receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your<br>own work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree<br>with her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that<br>is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when<br>you first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about<br>you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing<br>him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own<br>opinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious<br>Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr<br>Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,<br>fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with<br>them, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and<br>delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter<br>for the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is<br>simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have<br>noticed more than once in my life that husbands don’t quite get on with<br>their mothers-in-law, and I don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’s<br>way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so<br>long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and<br>Dounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most<br>joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:<br>know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a<br>very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of<br>almost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to<br>set off for Petersburg, exactly when I don’t know, but very, very soon,<br>possibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us<br>know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his<br>own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,<br>even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is<br>too soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall<br>press you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought<br>of seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry<br>Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing<br>anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,<br>so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for<br>a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting<br>herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But<br>although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much<br>money as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia<br>is to marry Pyotr Petrovitch, my credit has suddenly improved and I know<br>that Afanasy Ivanovitch will trust me now even to seventy-five roubles<br>on the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send<br>you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am<br>uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has<br>been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that<br>is to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big<br>trunk (which will be conveyed through some acquaintances of his), we<br>must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we<br>can’t be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But<br>we have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see<br>that the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from<br>us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we<br>know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel<br>quite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send<br>to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered<br>two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole<br>history, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,<br>I embrace you and send you a mother’s blessing till we meet. Love Dounia<br>your sister, Rodya; love her as she loves you and understand that she<br>loves you beyond everything, more than herself. She is an angel and you,<br>Rodya, you are everything to us--our one hope, our one consolation. If<br>only you are happy, we shall be happy. Do you still say your prayers,<br>Rodya, and believe in the mercy of our Creator and our Redeemer? I am<br>afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the new spirit of<br>infidelity that is abroad to-day; If it is so, I pray for you. Remember,<br>dear boy, how in your childhood, when your father was living, you used<br>to lisp your prayers at my knee, and how happy we all were in those<br>days. Good-bye, till we meet then--I embrace you warmly, warmly, with<br>many kisses.<br><br>“Yours till death,<br><br>“PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.”<br><br><br>Almost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov’s face was<br>wet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted<br>and a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips. He laid his<br>head down on his threadbare dirty pillow and pondered, pondered a long<br>time. His heart was beating violently, and his brain was in a turmoil.<br>At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was<br>like a cupboard or a box. His eyes and his mind craved for space. He<br>took up his hat and went out, this time without dread of meeting<br>anyone; he had forgotten his dread. He turned in the direction of the<br>Vassilyevsky Ostrov, walking along Vassilyevsky Prospect, as though<br>hastening on some business, but he walked, as his habit was, without<br>noticing his way, muttering and even speaking aloud to himself, to the<br>astonishment of the passers-by. Many of them took him to be drunk.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>His mother’s letter had been a torture to him, but as regards the chief<br>fact in it, he had felt not one moment’s hesitation, even whilst he was<br>reading the letter. The essential question was settled, and irrevocably<br>settled, in his mind: “Never such a marriage while I am alive and<br>Mr. Luzhin be damned!” “The thing is perfectly clear,” he muttered<br>to himself, with a malignant smile anticipating the triumph of his<br>decision. “No, mother, no, Dounia, you won’t deceive me! and then they<br>apologise for not asking my advice and for taking the decision without<br>me! I dare say! They imagine it is arranged now and can’t be broken<br>off; but we will see whether it can or not! A magnificent excuse:<br>‘Pyotr Petrovitch is such a busy man that even his wedding has to be in<br>post-haste, almost by express.’ No, Dounia, I see it all and I know what<br>you want to say to me; and I know too what you were thinking about, when<br>you walked up and down all night, and what your prayers were like before<br>the Holy Mother of Kazan who stands in mother’s bedroom. Bitter is<br>the ascent to Golgotha.... Hm... so it is finally settled; you have<br>determined to marry a sensible business man, Avdotya Romanovna, one<br>who has a fortune (has _already_ made his fortune, that is so much<br>more solid and impressive), a man who holds two government posts and who<br>shares the ideas of our most rising generation, as mother writes, and<br>who _seems_ to be kind, as Dounia herself observes. That _seems_ beats<br>everything! And that very Dounia for that very ‘_seems_’ is marrying<br>him! Splendid! splendid!<br><br>“... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about ‘our<br>most rising generation’? Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea<br>of prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them!<br>I should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one<br>another that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put into<br>_words_, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart<br>and in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and<br>better not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, from<br>mother’s letter it’s evident: he struck her as rude _a little_, and<br>mother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was<br>sure to be vexed and ‘answered her angrily.’ I should think so! Who<br>would not be angered when it was quite clear without any naïve questions<br>and when it was understood that it was useless to discuss it. And why<br>does she write to me, ‘love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than<br>herself’? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter<br>to her son? ‘You are our one comfort, you are everything to us.’ Oh,<br>mother!”<br><br>His bitterness grew more and more intense, and if he had happened to<br>meet Mr. Luzhin at the moment, he might have murdered him.<br><br>“Hm... yes, that’s true,” he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that<br>chased each other in his brain, “it is true that ‘it needs time and care<br>to get to know a man,’ but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. The<br>chief thing is he is ‘a man of business and _seems_ kind,’ that was<br>something, wasn’t it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man,<br>no doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a<br>peasant’s cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in<br>it). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can ‘travel very<br>comfortably, third class,’ for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One<br>must cut one’s coat according to one’s cloth, but what about you, Mr.<br>Luzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has<br>to raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure it’s a matter<br>of business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and<br>expenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. The<br>business man has got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost less<br>than their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that they<br>don’t both see all that, or is it that they don’t want to see? And<br>they are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the first<br>blossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! But what really<br>matters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_<br>of the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, it’s a<br>foretaste of it. And mother too, why should she be so lavish? What will<br>she have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or<br>two ‘paper ones’ as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm. What does<br>she expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has her reasons<br>already for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the<br>marriage, even for the first few months. The good man has no doubt let<br>slip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: ‘I<br>shall refuse,’ says she. On whom is she reckoning then? Is she counting<br>on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when<br>Afanasy Ivanovitch’s debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls and<br>embroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. And all her shawls don’t add<br>more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know<br>that. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin’s<br>generosity; ‘he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.’<br>You may wait a long time for that! That’s how it always is with these<br>Schilleresque noble hearts; till the last moment every goose is a swan<br>with them, till the last moment, they hope for the best and will see<br>nothing wrong, and although they have an inkling of the other side of<br>the picture, yet they won’t face the truth till they are forced to; the<br>very thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with<br>both hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool’s<br>cap on them with his own hands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin<br>has any orders of merit; I bet he has the Anna in his buttonhole and<br>that he puts it on when he goes to dine with contractors or merchants.<br>He will be sure to have it for his wedding, too! Enough of him, confound<br>him!<br><br>“Well,... mother I don’t wonder at, it’s like her, God bless her, but<br>how could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! You were<br>nearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. Mother writes<br>that ‘Dounia can put up with a great deal.’ I know that very well. I<br>knew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half<br>years I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that ‘Dounia<br>can put up with a great deal.’ If she could put up with Mr. Svidrigaïlov<br>and all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal. And<br>now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up<br>with Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of<br>wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband’s<br>bounty--who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview. Granted<br>that he ‘let it slip,’ though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it<br>was not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as<br>possible) but Dounia, Dounia? She understands the man, of course, but<br>she will have to live with the man. Why! she’d live on black bread<br>and water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral<br>freedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein,<br>much less Mr. Luzhin’s money. No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew<br>her and... she is still the same, of course! Yes, there’s no denying,<br>the Svidrigaïlovs are a bitter pill! It’s a bitter thing to spend one’s<br>life a governess in the provinces for two hundred roubles, but I know<br>she would rather be a nigger on a plantation or a Lett with a German<br>master than degrade her soul, and her moral dignity, by binding herself<br>for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has<br>nothing in common--for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been of<br>unalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to<br>become his legal concubine. Why is she consenting then? What’s the<br>point of it? What’s the answer? It’s clear enough: for herself, for her<br>comfort, to save her life she would not sell herself, but for someone<br>else she is doing it! For one she loves, for one she adores, she will<br>sell herself! That’s what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her<br>mother, she will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases,<br>‘we overcome our moral feeling if necessary,’ freedom, peace, conscience<br>even, all, all are brought into the market. Let my life go, if only my<br>dear ones may be happy! More than that, we become casuists, we learn<br>to be Jesuitical and for a time maybe we can soothe ourselves, we can<br>persuade ourselves that it is one’s duty for a good object. That’s just<br>like us, it’s as clear as daylight. It’s clear that Rodion Romanovitch<br>Raskolnikov is the central figure in the business, and no one else. Oh,<br>yes, she can ensure his happiness, keep him in the university, make him<br>a partner in the office, make his whole future secure; perhaps he may<br>even be a rich man later on, prosperous, respected, and may even end his<br>life a famous man! But my mother? It’s all Rodya, precious Rodya, her<br>first born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh,<br>loving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his sake we would not shrink even<br>from Sonia’s fate. Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long<br>as the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both<br>of you? Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in<br>it? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia’s life is no worse than life with<br>Mr. Luzhin. ‘There can be no question of love,’ mother writes. And what<br>if there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion,<br>contempt, repulsion, what then? So you will have to ‘keep up your<br>appearance,’ too. Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartness<br>means? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same<br>thing as Sonia’s and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case,<br>Dounia, it’s a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it’s<br>simply a question of starvation. It has to be paid for, it has to be<br>paid for, Dounia, this smartness. And what if it’s more than you can<br>bear afterwards, if you regret it? The bitterness, the misery, the<br>curses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa<br>Petrovna. And how will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy,<br>she is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? And I? Yes,<br>indeed, what have you taken me for? I won’t have your sacrifice, Dounia,<br>I won’t have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it<br>shall not, it shall not! I won’t accept it!”<br><br>He suddenly paused in his reflection and stood still.<br><br>“It shall not be? But what are you going to do to prevent it? You’ll<br>forbid it? And what right have you? What can you promise them on your<br>side to give you such a right? Your whole life, your whole future, you<br>will devote to them _when you have finished your studies and obtained a<br>post_? Yes, we have heard all that before, and that’s all _words_, but<br>now? Now something must be done, now, do you understand that? And<br>what are you doing now? You are living upon them. They borrow on their<br>hundred roubles pension. They borrow from the Svidrigaïlovs. How are<br>you going to save them from Svidrigaïlovs, from Afanasy Ivanovitch<br>Vahrushin, oh, future millionaire Zeus who would arrange their lives for<br>them? In another ten years? In another ten years, mother will be blind<br>with knitting shawls, maybe with weeping too. She will be worn to a<br>shadow with fasting; and my sister? Imagine for a moment what may have<br>become of your sister in ten years? What may happen to her during those<br>ten years? Can you fancy?”<br><br>So he tortured himself, fretting himself with such questions, and<br>finding a kind of enjoyment in it. And yet all these questions were not<br>new ones suddenly confronting him, they were old familiar aches. It was<br>long since they had first begun to grip and rend his heart. Long, long<br>ago his present anguish had its first beginnings; it had waxed and<br>gathered strength, it had matured and concentrated, until it had taken<br>the form of a fearful, frenzied and fantastic question, which tortured<br>his heart and mind, clamouring insistently for an answer. Now his<br>mother’s letter had burst on him like a thunderclap. It was clear<br>that he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved<br>questions, but that he must do something, do it at once, and do it<br>quickly. Anyway he must decide on something, or else...<br><br>“Or throw up life altogether!” he cried suddenly, in a frenzy--“accept<br>one’s lot humbly as it is, once for all and stifle everything in<br>oneself, giving up all claim to activity, life and love!”<br><br>“Do you understand, sir, do you understand what it means when you have<br>absolutely nowhere to turn?” Marmeladov’s question came suddenly into<br>his mind, “for every man must have somewhere to turn....”<br><br>He gave a sudden start; another thought, that he had had yesterday,<br>slipped back into his mind. But he did not start at the thought<br>recurring to him, for he knew, he had _felt beforehand_, that it must<br>come back, he was expecting it; besides it was not only yesterday’s<br>thought. The difference was that a month ago, yesterday even, the<br>thought was a mere dream: but now... now it appeared not a dream at all,<br>it had taken a new menacing and quite unfamiliar shape, and he suddenly<br>became aware of this himself.... He felt a hammering in his head, and<br>there was a darkness before his eyes.<br><br>He looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something. He wanted<br>to sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----<br>Boulevard. There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. He<br>walked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little<br>adventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the seat, he had<br>noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first<br>he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his<br>path. It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the<br>road by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that. But<br>there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front<br>of him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first<br>reluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more<br>intently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so<br>strange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl<br>quite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with<br>no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had<br>on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not<br>properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the<br>waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was<br>flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl was<br>walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She<br>drew Raskolnikov’s whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at the<br>seat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;<br>she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,<br>apparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at once<br>that she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He<br>could hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the<br>face of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than<br>fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking<br>and, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was<br>doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and<br>showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.<br><br>Raskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,<br>and stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard was never much<br>frequented; and now, at two o’clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite<br>deserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen<br>paces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,<br>too, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object<br>of his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had<br>followed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily at<br>him, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding<br>his time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His<br>intentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set<br>man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and<br>moustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult<br>this fat dandy in some way. He left the girl for a moment and walked<br>towards the gentleman.<br><br>“Hey! You Svidrigaïlov! What do you want here?” he shouted, clenching<br>his fists and laughing, spluttering with rage.<br><br>“What do you mean?” the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty<br>astonishment.<br><br>“Get away, that’s what I mean.”<br><br>“How dare you, you low fellow!”<br><br>He raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without<br>reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like<br>himself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a<br>police constable stood between them.<br><br>“That’s enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What<br>do you want? Who are you?” he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his<br>rags.<br><br>Raskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward, sensible,<br>soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.<br><br>“You are just the man I want,” Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm.<br>“I am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too,” he<br>added, addressing the gentleman, “come along, I have something to show<br>you.”<br><br>And taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.<br><br>“Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.<br>There is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a<br>professional. It’s more likely she has been given drink and deceived<br>somewhere... for the first time... you understand? and they’ve put her<br>out into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, and<br>the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has<br>not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man’s hands;<br>that’s evident. And now look there: I don’t know that dandy with whom I<br>was going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen<br>her on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now<br>he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she<br>is in this state... that’s certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I saw<br>him myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he<br>is just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and<br>is standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can we<br>keep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?”<br><br>The policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy to<br>understand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over to<br>examine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.<br><br>“Ah, what a pity!” he said, shaking his head--“why, she is quite a<br>child! She has been deceived, you can see that at once. Listen, lady,”<br> he began addressing her, “where do you live?” The girl opened her weary<br>and sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her<br>hand.<br><br>“Here,” said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty<br>copecks, “here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. The<br>only thing is to find out her address!”<br><br>“Missy, missy!” the policeman began again, taking the money. “I’ll fetch<br>you a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you, eh? Where do<br>you live?”<br><br>“Go away! They won’t let me alone,” the girl muttered, and once more<br>waved her hand.<br><br>“Ach, ach, how shocking! It’s shameful, missy, it’s a shame!” He shook<br>his head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant.<br><br>“It’s a difficult job,” the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he<br>did so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must have<br>seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!<br><br>“Did you meet her far from here?” he asked him.<br><br>“I tell you she was walking in front of me, staggering, just here, in<br>the boulevard. She only just reached the seat and sank down on it.”<br><br>“Ah, the shameful things that are done in the world nowadays, God have<br>mercy on us! An innocent creature like that, drunk already! She has been<br>deceived, that’s a sure thing. See how her dress has been torn too....<br>Ah, the vice one sees nowadays! And as likely as not she belongs to<br>gentlefolk too, poor ones maybe.... There are many like that nowadays.<br>She looks refined, too, as though she were a lady,” and he bent over her<br>once more.<br><br>Perhaps he had daughters growing up like that, “looking like ladies and<br>refined” with pretensions to gentility and smartness....<br><br>“The chief thing is,” Raskolnikov persisted, “to keep her out of this<br>scoundrel’s hands! Why should he outrage her! It’s as clear as day what<br>he is after; ah, the brute, he is not moving off!”<br><br>Raskolnikov spoke aloud and pointed to him. The gentleman heard him,<br>and seemed about to fly into a rage again, but thought better of it, and<br>confined himself to a contemptuous look. He then walked slowly another<br>ten paces away and again halted.<br><br>“Keep her out of his hands we can,” said the constable thoughtfully,<br>“if only she’d tell us where to take her, but as it is.... Missy, hey,<br>missy!” he bent over her once more.<br><br>She opened her eyes fully all of a sudden, looked at him intently, as<br>though realising something, got up from the seat and walked away in the<br>direction from which she had come. “Oh shameful wretches, they won’t let<br>me alone!” she said, waving her hand again. She walked quickly, though<br>staggering as before. The dandy followed her, but along another avenue,<br>keeping his eye on her.<br><br>“Don’t be anxious, I won’t let him have her,” the policeman said<br>resolutely, and he set off after them.<br><br>“Ah, the vice one sees nowadays!” he repeated aloud, sighing.<br><br>At that moment something seemed to sting Raskolnikov; in an instant a<br>complete revulsion of feeling came over him.<br><br>“Hey, here!” he shouted after the policeman.<br><br>The latter turned round.<br><br>“Let them be! What is it to do with you? Let her go! Let him amuse<br>himself.” He pointed at the dandy, “What is it to do with you?”<br><br>The policeman was bewildered, and stared at him open-eyed. Raskolnikov<br>laughed.<br><br>“Well!” ejaculated the policeman, with a gesture of contempt, and he<br>walked after the dandy and the girl, probably taking Raskolnikov for a<br>madman or something even worse.<br><br>“He has carried off my twenty copecks,” Raskolnikov murmured angrily<br>when he was left alone. “Well, let him take as much from the other<br>fellow to allow him to have the girl and so let it end. And why did I<br>want to interfere? Is it for me to help? Have I any right to help? Let<br>them devour each other alive--what is it to me? How did I dare to give him<br>twenty copecks? Were they mine?”<br><br>In spite of those strange words he felt very wretched. He sat down on<br>the deserted seat. His thoughts strayed aimlessly.... He found it hard<br>to fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himself<br>altogether, to forget everything, and then to wake up and begin life<br>anew....<br><br>“Poor girl!” he said, looking at the empty corner where she had<br>sat--“She will come to herself and weep, and then her mother will find<br>out.... She will give her a beating, a horrible, shameful beating and<br>then maybe, turn her out of doors.... And even if she does not, the<br>Darya Frantsovnas will get wind of it, and the girl will soon be<br>slipping out on the sly here and there. Then there will be the hospital<br>directly (that’s always the luck of those girls with respectable<br>mothers, who go wrong on the sly) and then... again the hospital...<br>drink... the taverns... and more hospital, in two or three years--a<br>wreck, and her life over at eighteen or nineteen.... Have not I seen<br>cases like that? And how have they been brought to it? Why, they’ve all<br>come to it like that. Ugh! But what does it matter? That’s as it should<br>be, they tell us. A certain percentage, they tell us, must every year<br>go... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain<br>chaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid words<br>they have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once you’ve said<br>‘percentage’ there’s nothing more to worry about. If we had any other<br>word... maybe we might feel more uneasy.... But what if Dounia were one<br>of the percentage! Of another one if not that one?<br><br>“But where am I going?” he thought suddenly. “Strange, I came out for<br>something. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was going<br>to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That’s what it was... now I<br>remember. What for, though? And what put the idea of going to Razumihin<br>into my head just now? That’s curious.”<br><br>He wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the<br>university. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at<br>the university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did<br>not welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave<br>him up. He took no part in the students’ gatherings, amusements or<br>conversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,<br>and he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,<br>and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though<br>he were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades<br>to look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in<br>development, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and<br>interests were beneath him.<br><br>With Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and<br>communicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any other<br>terms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid<br>youth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and<br>dignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comrades<br>understood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,<br>though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of striking<br>appearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was<br>sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.<br>One night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid<br>a gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinking<br>powers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went<br>too far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.<br>Another thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and<br>it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. He<br>could lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He was<br>very poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of<br>one sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earn<br>money. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to<br>declare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in<br>the cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the<br>university, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his<br>might to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had<br>not been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even<br>know his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,<br>but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that<br>he might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed<br>him by, as he did not want to annoy him.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>“Of course, I’ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihin’s to ask for<br>work, to ask him to get me lessons or something...” Raskolnikov thought,<br>“but what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose<br>he shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that<br>I could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons...<br>hm... Well and what then? What shall I do with the few coppers I<br>earn? That’s not what I want now. It’s really absurd for me to go to<br>Razumihin....”<br><br>The question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more<br>than he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister<br>significance in this apparently ordinary action.<br><br>“Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by<br>means of Razumihin alone?” he asked himself in perplexity.<br><br>He pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long<br>musing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic<br>thought came into his head.<br><br>“Hm... to Razumihin’s,” he said all at once, calmly, as though he had<br>reached a final determination. “I shall go to Razumihin’s of course,<br>but... not now. I shall go to him... on the next day after It, when It<br>will be over and everything will begin afresh....”<br><br>And suddenly he realised what he was thinking.<br><br>“After It,” he shouted, jumping up from the seat, “but is It really<br>going to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?” He left the<br>seat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,<br>but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;<br>in that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for a<br>month past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.<br><br>His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel<br>shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort he<br>began almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all<br>the objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his<br>attention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into<br>brooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,<br>he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he<br>was going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came<br>out on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the<br>islands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary<br>eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in<br>and weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,<br>no stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid<br>irritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer<br>villa standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw<br>in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,<br>and children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught his<br>attention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, by<br>luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them<br>with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from<br>his sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had<br>thirty copecks. “Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the<br>letter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs<br>yesterday,” he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he<br>soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.<br>He recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he<br>was hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a<br>pie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a long<br>while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,<br>though he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy and<br>a great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reaching<br>Petrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road<br>into the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.<br><br>In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular<br>actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. At times<br>monstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are<br>so truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but<br>so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like<br>Pushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking<br>state. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a<br>powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.<br><br>Raskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhood<br>in the little town of his birth. He was a child about seven years old,<br>walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. It<br>was a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;<br>indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in<br>memory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not<br>even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark<br>blur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market<br>garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a<br>feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.<br>There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,<br>hideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking<br>figures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his<br>father, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road<br>became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a<br>winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the<br>right to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone<br>church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three<br>times a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in<br>memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never<br>seen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a<br>table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in<br>the shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned<br>ikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmother’s<br>grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger<br>brother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all,<br>but he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited<br>the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and<br>to bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was<br>walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he<br>was holding his father’s hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A<br>peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be<br>some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed<br>townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,<br>all singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern<br>stood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually<br>drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy<br>goods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their<br>long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect<br>mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going<br>with a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts of<br>such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants’<br>nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load<br>of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in<br>a rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even<br>about the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that<br>he almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the<br>window. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing<br>and the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken<br>peasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over<br>their shoulders.<br><br>“Get in, get in!” shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with<br>a fleshy face red as a carrot. “I’ll take you all, get in!”<br><br>But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the<br>crowd.<br><br>“Take us all with a beast like that!”<br><br>“Why, Mikolka, are you crazy to put a nag like that in such a cart?”<br><br>“And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!”<br><br>“Get in, I’ll take you all,” Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into<br>the cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. “The bay<br>has gone with Matvey,” he shouted from the cart--“and this brute, mates,<br>is just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her. She’s just<br>eating her head off. Get in, I tell you! I’ll make her gallop! She’ll<br>gallop!” and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to<br>flog the little mare.<br><br>“Get in! Come along!” The crowd laughed. “D’you hear, she’ll gallop!”<br><br>“Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!”<br><br>“She’ll jog along!”<br><br>“Don’t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!”<br><br>“All right! Give it to her!”<br><br>They all clambered into Mikolka’s cart, laughing and making jokes. Six<br>men got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat,<br>rosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded<br>headdress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.<br>The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help<br>laughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a<br>gallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to<br>help Mikolka. With the cry of “now,” the mare tugged with all her might,<br>but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with<br>her legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which<br>were showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in the<br>crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed<br>the mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.<br><br>“Let me get in, too, mates,” shouted a young man in the crowd whose<br>appetite was aroused.<br><br>“Get in, all get in,” cried Mikolka, “she will draw you all. I’ll beat<br>her to death!” And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself<br>with fury.<br><br>“Father, father,” he cried, “father, what are they doing? Father, they<br>are beating the poor horse!”<br><br>“Come along, come along!” said his father. “They are drunken and<br>foolish, they are in fun; come away, don’t look!” and he tried to draw<br>him away, but he tore himself away from his hand, and, beside himself<br>with horror, ran to the horse. The poor beast was in a bad way. She was<br>gasping, standing still, then tugging again and almost falling.<br><br>“Beat her to death,” cried Mikolka, “it’s come to that. I’ll do for<br>her!”<br><br>“What are you about, are you a Christian, you devil?” shouted an old man<br>in the crowd.<br><br>“Did anyone ever see the like? A wretched nag like that pulling such a<br>cartload,” said another.<br><br>“You’ll kill her,” shouted the third.<br><br>“Don’t meddle! It’s my property, I’ll do what I choose. Get in, more of<br>you! Get in, all of you! I will have her go at a gallop!...”<br><br>All at once laughter broke into a roar and covered everything: the mare,<br>roused by the shower of blows, began feebly kicking. Even the old man<br>could not help smiling. To think of a wretched little beast like that<br>trying to kick!<br><br>Two lads in the crowd snatched up whips and ran to the mare to beat her<br>about the ribs. One ran each side.<br><br>“Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes,” cried Mikolka.<br><br>“Give us a song, mates,” shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the<br>cart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling. The<br>woman went on cracking nuts and laughing.<br><br>... He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped<br>across the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, his<br>tears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across<br>the face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, he<br>rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was<br>shaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand and<br>would have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to<br>the mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.<br><br>“I’ll teach you to kick,” Mikolka shouted ferociously. He threw down<br>the whip, bent forward and picked up from the bottom of the cart a long,<br>thick shaft, he took hold of one end with both hands and with an effort<br>brandished it over the mare.<br><br>“He’ll crush her,” was shouted round him. “He’ll kill her!”<br><br>“It’s my property,” shouted Mikolka and brought the shaft down with a<br>swinging blow. There was a sound of a heavy thud.<br><br>“Thrash her, thrash her! Why have you stopped?” shouted voices in the<br>crowd.<br><br>And Mikolka swung the shaft a second time and it fell a second time<br>on the spine of the luckless mare. She sank back on her haunches, but<br>lurched forward and tugged forward with all her force, tugged first on<br>one side and then on the other, trying to move the cart. But the six<br>whips were attacking her in all directions, and the shaft was raised<br>again and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured<br>blows. Mikolka was in a fury that he could not kill her at one blow.<br><br>“She’s a tough one,” was shouted in the crowd.<br><br>“She’ll fall in a minute, mates, there will soon be an end of her,” said<br>an admiring spectator in the crowd.<br><br>“Fetch an axe to her! Finish her off,” shouted a third.<br><br>“I’ll show you! Stand off,” Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down<br>the shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. “Look<br>out,” he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the<br>poor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull,<br>but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on<br>the ground like a log.<br><br>“Finish her off,” shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out of<br>the cart. Several young men, also flushed with drink, seized anything<br>they could come across--whips, sticks, poles, and ran to the dying<br>mare. Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the<br>crowbar. The mare stretched out her head, drew a long breath and died.<br><br>“You butchered her,” someone shouted in the crowd.<br><br>“Why wouldn’t she gallop then?”<br><br>“My property!” shouted Mikolka, with bloodshot eyes, brandishing the bar<br>in his hands. He stood as though regretting that he had nothing more to<br>beat.<br><br>“No mistake about it, you are not a Christian,” many voices were<br>shouting in the crowd.<br><br>But the poor boy, beside himself, made his way, screaming, through the<br>crowd to the sorrel nag, put his arms round her bleeding dead head and<br>kissed it, kissed the eyes and kissed the lips.... Then he jumped up and<br>flew in a frenzy with his little fists out at Mikolka. At that instant<br>his father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried<br>him out of the crowd.<br><br>“Come along, come! Let us go home,” he said to him.<br><br>“Father! Why did they... kill... the poor horse!” he sobbed, but his<br>voice broke and the words came in shrieks from his panting chest.<br><br>“They are drunk.... They are brutal... it’s not our business!” said his<br>father. He put his arms round his father but he felt choked, choked. He<br>tried to draw a breath, to cry out--and woke up.<br><br>He waked up, gasping for breath, his hair soaked with perspiration, and<br>stood up in terror.<br><br>“Thank God, that was only a dream,” he said, sitting down under a tree<br>and drawing deep breaths. “But what is it? Is it some fever coming on?<br>Such a hideous dream!”<br><br>He felt utterly broken: darkness and confusion were in his soul. He<br>rested his elbows on his knees and leaned his head on his hands.<br><br>“Good God!” he cried, “can it be, can it be, that I shall really take an<br>axe, that I shall strike her on the head, split her skull open... that I<br>shall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble;<br>hide, all spattered in the blood... with the axe.... Good God, can it<br>be?”<br><br>He was shaking like a leaf as he said this.<br><br>“But why am I going on like this?” he continued, sitting up again, as it<br>were in profound amazement. “I knew that I could never bring myself<br>to it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now? Yesterday,<br>yesterday, when I went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday I<br>realised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I going<br>over it again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairs<br>yesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... the<br>very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.<br><br>“No, I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Granted, granted that there is<br>no flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last<br>month is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldn’t<br>bring myself to it! I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Why, why then am<br>I still...?”<br><br>He rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at<br>finding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,<br>his eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly<br>to breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that<br>had so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense<br>of relief and peace in his soul. “Lord,” he prayed, “show me my path--I<br>renounce that accursed... dream of mine.”<br><br>Crossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the<br>glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness he<br>was not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had been<br>forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom,<br>freedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!<br><br>Later on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during<br>those days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously<br>impressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very<br>exceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined<br>turning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain to<br>himself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been<br>more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,<br>he had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It was<br>obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. It<br>is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without<br>noticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always asking<br>himself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time<br>such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he<br>had moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his<br>life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances<br>in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive<br>influence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait for<br>him on purpose!<br><br>It was about nine o’clock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tables<br>and the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were<br>closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their<br>wares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers and<br>costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty<br>and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly<br>liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly<br>in the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,<br>and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At<br>the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out<br>with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up to<br>go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just<br>come up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone<br>called her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona<br>Ivanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his<br>watch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizaveta<br>and she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about<br>thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was<br>a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who<br>made her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing with<br>a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and<br>doubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The<br>moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange<br>sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing<br>astonishing about this meeting.<br><br>“You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,” the<br>huckster was saying aloud. “Come round to-morrow about seven. They will<br>be here too.”<br><br>“To-morrow?” said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to<br>make up her mind.<br><br>“Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna,” gabbled<br>the huckster’s wife, a lively little woman. “I look at you, you are like<br>some little babe. And she is not your own sister either--nothing but a<br>step-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!”<br><br>“But this time don’t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,” her husband<br>interrupted; “that’s my advice, but come round to us without asking.<br>It will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have a<br>notion.”<br><br>“Am I to come?”<br><br>“About seven o’clock to-morrow. And they will be here. You will be able<br>to decide for yourself.”<br><br>“And we’ll have a cup of tea,” added his wife.<br><br>“All right, I’ll come,” said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she began<br>slowly moving away.<br><br>Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,<br>unnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed<br>by a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. He had<br>learnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at<br>seven o’clock Lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and only companion, would<br>be away from home and that therefore at seven o’clock precisely the old<br>woman _would be left alone_.<br><br>He was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a man<br>condemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;<br>but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom<br>of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably<br>decided.<br><br>Certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he<br>could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan<br>than that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would have<br>been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with<br>greater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and<br>investigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose<br>life an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his<br>wife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was<br>nothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been<br>reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all<br>women’s things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,<br>they were looking for a dealer. This was Lizaveta’s business. She<br>undertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest<br>and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule<br>little and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.<br><br>But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of<br>superstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.<br>And in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something<br>strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar<br>influences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew<br>called Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to<br>give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he<br>might want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, for<br>he had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had<br>remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his<br>father’s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,<br>a present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When<br>he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her<br>at the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got<br>two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way<br>home. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange<br>idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very<br>much absorbed him.<br><br>Almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he<br>did not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They had<br>played a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard<br>the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and<br>give him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he<br>had just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course<br>it was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary<br>impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;<br>the student began telling his friend various details about Alyona<br>Ivanovna.<br><br>“She is first-rate,” he said. “You can always get money from her. She is<br>as rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and<br>she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have<br>had dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy....”<br><br>And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you<br>were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she<br>gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven<br>percent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, saying<br>that she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was<br>continually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,<br>though Lizaveta was at least six feet high.<br><br>“There’s a phenomenon for you,” cried the student and he laughed.<br><br>They began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a<br>peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened<br>with great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending<br>for him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about<br>her. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,<br>being the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked<br>day and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the<br>washing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister<br>all she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind<br>without her sister’s permission. The old woman had already made her<br>will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a<br>farthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was<br>left to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might be<br>said for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,<br>unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long<br>feet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore battered<br>goatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressed<br>most surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was<br>continually with child.<br><br>“But you say she is hideous?” observed the officer.<br><br>“Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but<br>you know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured face<br>and eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people are<br>attracted by her. She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up<br>with anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her smile is<br>really very sweet.”<br><br>“You seem to find her attractive yourself,” laughed the officer.<br><br>“From her queerness. No, I’ll tell you what. I could kill that damned<br>old woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without the<br>faintest conscience-prick,” the student added with warmth. The officer<br>laughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!<br><br>“Listen, I want to ask you a serious question,” the student said hotly.<br>“I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,<br>senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply<br>useless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is<br>living for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case. You<br>understand? You understand?”<br><br>“Yes, yes, I understand,” answered the officer, watching his excited<br>companion attentively.<br><br>“Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for<br>want of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand good<br>deeds could be done and helped, on that old woman’s money which will be<br>buried in a monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the<br>right path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from<br>vice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her, take<br>her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of<br>humanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny<br>crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands<br>would be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives<br>in exchange--it’s simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of<br>that sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!<br>No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact<br>because the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives of<br>others; the other day she bit Lizaveta’s finger out of spite; it almost<br>had to be amputated.”<br><br>“Of course she does not deserve to live,” remarked the officer, “but<br>there it is, it’s nature.”<br><br>“Oh, well, brother, but we have to correct and direct nature, and, but<br>for that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that,<br>there would never have been a single great man. They talk of<br>duty, conscience--I don’t want to say anything against duty and<br>conscience;--but the point is, what do we mean by them? Stay, I have<br>another question to ask you. Listen!”<br><br>“No, you stay, I’ll ask you a question. Listen!”<br><br>“Well?”<br><br>“You are talking and speechifying away, but tell me, would you kill the<br>old woman _yourself_?”<br><br>“Of course not! I was only arguing the justice of it.... It’s nothing to<br>do with me....”<br><br>“But I think, if you would not do it yourself, there’s no justice about<br>it.... Let us have another game.”<br><br>Raskolnikov was violently agitated. Of course, it was all ordinary<br>youthful talk and thought, such as he had often heard before in<br>different forms and on different themes. But why had he happened to hear<br>such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain<br>was just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why, just at the<br>moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old<br>woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? This<br>coincidence always seemed strange to him. This trivial talk in a tavern<br>had an immense influence on him in his later action; as though there had<br>really been in it something preordained, some guiding hint....<br><br>*****<br><br>On returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat<br>for a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had no<br>candle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up. He could never<br>recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. At<br>last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised<br>with relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden sleep<br>came over him, as it were crushing him.<br><br>He slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya,<br>coming into his room at ten o’clock the next morning, had difficulty<br>in rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again the<br>second brew and again in her own tea-pot.<br><br>“My goodness, how he sleeps!” she cried indignantly. “And he is always<br>asleep.”<br><br>He got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, took a turn in<br>his garret and sank back on the sofa again.<br><br>“Going to sleep again,” cried Nastasya. “Are you ill, eh?”<br><br>He made no reply.<br><br>“Do you want some tea?”<br><br>“Afterwards,” he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turning<br>to the wall.<br><br>Nastasya stood over him.<br><br>“Perhaps he really is ill,” she said, turned and went out. She came in<br>again at two o’clock with soup. He was lying as before. The tea stood<br>untouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully<br>rousing him.<br><br>“Why are you lying like a log?” she shouted, looking at him with<br>repulsion.<br><br>He got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.<br><br>“Are you ill or not?” asked Nastasya and again received no answer.<br>“You’d better go out and get a breath of air,” she said after a pause.<br>“Will you eat it or not?”<br><br>“Afterwards,” he said weakly. “You can go.”<br><br>And he motioned her out.<br><br>She remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went<br>out.<br><br>A few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while<br>at the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread, took up a spoon and<br>began to eat.<br><br>He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were<br>mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself<br>on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,<br>with his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such<br>strange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was<br>in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,<br>the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a<br>complete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water<br>from a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was<br>wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured<br>stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like<br>gold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,<br>raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,<br>suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the<br>sofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began<br>listening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet<br>on the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and<br>monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the<br>previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And<br>meanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction<br>were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted<br>haste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his<br>energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart<br>kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had<br>to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He<br>rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away<br>under it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long<br>strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded<br>this strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some<br>stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two<br>ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook<br>as he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside<br>when he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready<br>long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the<br>noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended<br>for the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the<br>street in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have<br>had to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now<br>he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang<br>quietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat<br>pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did<br>not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it<br>could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the<br>hand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed a<br>fortnight before.<br><br>When he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening<br>between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out<br>the _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This<br>pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and<br>thickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood<br>in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of<br>a workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece<br>of iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.<br>Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,<br>he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round<br>them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and<br>tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This<br>was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while<br>she was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip<br>was added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first<br>minute that the “thing” was made of wood. All this had been stored by<br>him beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when<br>he heard someone suddenly about in the yard.<br><br>“It struck six long ago.”<br><br>“Long ago! My God!”<br><br>He rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend<br>his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still the<br>most important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the<br>deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a<br>pocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less<br>on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in<br>passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by<br>him in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final<br>they were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in<br>his eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for<br>a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his<br>plans.<br><br>And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point<br>could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of<br>any kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all<br>as something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of<br>unsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,<br>that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.<br>Nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;<br>she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the<br>door ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her<br>about. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into<br>the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything<br>was over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.<br>Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had<br>come back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait<br>till she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss<br>the axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at<br>least grounds for suspicion.<br><br>But those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and<br>indeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put off<br>trifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed<br>utterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not<br>imagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get<br>up and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with<br>the object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at<br>an experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say<br>“come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!”--and at once he<br>had broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.<br>Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his<br>analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he<br>could not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort<br>he simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought<br>arguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were<br>forcing and drawing him to it.<br><br>At first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one<br>question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily<br>detected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He<br>had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his<br>opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility<br>of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every<br>criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a<br>childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence<br>and caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse<br>of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,<br>developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the<br>perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment<br>of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the<br>individual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The<br>question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the<br>crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of<br>the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.<br><br>When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there<br>could not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would<br>remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the<br>simple reason that his design was “not a crime....” We will omit all the<br>process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have<br>run too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely<br>material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his<br>mind. “One has but to keep all one’s will-power and reason to deal<br>with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has<br>familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....” But<br>this preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he<br>came to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite<br>differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.<br><br>One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even<br>left the staircase. When he reached the landlady’s kitchen, the door<br>of which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in<br>Nastasya’s absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether<br>the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when<br>he went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly<br>saw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied<br>there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing<br>him, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him<br>all the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as<br>though he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not<br>the axe! He was overwhelmed.<br><br>“What made me think,” he reflected, as he went under the gateway, “what<br>made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!<br>Why, why, why did I assume this so certainly?”<br><br>He was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in<br>his anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.<br><br>He stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walk<br>for appearance’ sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more<br>revolting. “And what a chance I have lost for ever!” he muttered,<br>standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter’s little<br>dark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porter’s<br>room, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the<br>right caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the<br>room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called<br>the porter. “Yes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for<br>the door is wide open.” He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled<br>it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;<br>at once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both<br>hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!<br>“When reason fails, the devil helps!” he thought with a strange grin.<br>This chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.<br><br>He walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening<br>suspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking<br>at their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.<br>Suddenly he thought of his hat. “Good heavens! I had the money the day<br>before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!” A curse rose<br>from the bottom of his soul.<br><br>Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on<br>the wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and at<br>the same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the<br>other side....<br><br>When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes<br>thought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very much<br>afraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupied<br>by irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov<br>garden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great<br>fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all<br>the squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer<br>garden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the<br>garden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a<br>great benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why<br>in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some<br>peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there<br>are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all<br>sorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back<br>to his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. “What nonsense!”<br> he thought, “better think of nothing at all!”<br><br>“So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that<br>meets them on the way,” flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,<br>like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now<br>he was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock<br>somewhere struck once. “What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it<br>must be fast!”<br><br>Luckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that very<br>moment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had<br>just driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under<br>the gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into<br>the yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other<br>side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one<br>noticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge<br>quadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his<br>head--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old<br>woman’s room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was<br>already on the stairs....<br><br>Drawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and<br>once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly<br>and cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the<br>stairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no<br>one. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were<br>at work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought<br>a minute and went on. “Of course it would be better if they had not been<br>here, but... it’s two storeys above them.”<br><br>And there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the<br>flat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old woman’s was<br>apparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been<br>torn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant<br>the thought floated through his mind “Shall I go back?” But he made no<br>answer and began listening at the old woman’s door, a dead silence. Then<br>he listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...<br>then looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew<br>himself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. “Am I very pale?”<br> he wondered. “Am I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had I<br>better wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?”<br><br>But his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite<br>him, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,<br>he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he<br>rang again, more loudly.<br><br>No answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman<br>was, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had some<br>knowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.<br>Either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to<br>suppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenly<br>heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the<br>rustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily<br>close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly<br>listening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved<br>a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have<br>the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,<br>and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out<br>in his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he<br>had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and<br>he was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the<br>latch unfastened.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>The door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and<br>suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lost<br>his head and nearly made a great mistake.<br><br>Fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not<br>hoping that the sight of him would disarm her suspicions, he took<br>hold of the door and drew it towards him to prevent the old woman from<br>attempting to shut it again. Seeing this she did not pull the door back,<br>but she did not let go the handle so that he almost dragged her out with<br>it on to the stairs. Seeing that she was standing in the doorway not<br>allowing him to pass, he advanced straight upon her. She stepped back<br>in alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared<br>with open eyes at him.<br><br>“Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna,” he began, trying to speak easily, but<br>his voice would not obey him, it broke and shook. “I have come... I have<br>brought something... but we’d better come in... to the light....”<br><br>And leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. The old<br>woman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.<br><br>“Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?”<br><br>“Why, Alyona Ivanovna, you know me... Raskolnikov... here, I brought you<br>the pledge I promised the other day...” And he held out the pledge.<br><br>The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in<br>the eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently, maliciously and<br>mistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer<br>in her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that<br>he was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened<br>that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half<br>minute, he thought he would have run away from her.<br><br>“Why do you look at me as though you did not know me?” he said suddenly,<br>also with malice. “Take it if you like, if not I’ll go elsewhere, I am<br>in a hurry.”<br><br>He had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of<br>itself. The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor’s resolute tone<br>evidently restored her confidence.<br><br>“But why, my good sir, all of a minute.... What is it?” she asked,<br>looking at the pledge.<br><br>“The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know.”<br><br>She held out her hand.<br><br>“But how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?<br>Have you been bathing, or what?”<br><br>“Fever,” he answered abruptly. “You can’t help getting pale... if you’ve<br>nothing to eat,” he added, with difficulty articulating the words.<br><br>His strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like the<br>truth; the old woman took the pledge.<br><br>“What is it?” she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and<br>weighing the pledge in her hand.<br><br>“A thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it.”<br><br>“It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!”<br><br>Trying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all<br>her windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left<br>him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. He<br>unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet<br>take it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the<br>coat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing<br>more numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and<br>fall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.<br><br>“But what has he tied it up like this for?” the old woman cried with<br>vexation and moved towards him.<br><br>He had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung<br>it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without<br>effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He<br>seemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once<br>brought the axe down, his strength returned to him.<br><br>The old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked<br>with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat’s tail and<br>fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.<br>As she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She<br>cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the<br>floor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held “the<br>pledge.” Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side<br>and on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the<br>body fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her<br>face; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,<br>the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.<br><br>He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her<br>pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket<br>from which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full<br>possession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his<br>hands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been<br>particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get<br>smeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,<br>as before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom<br>with them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.<br>Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with<br>a silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of<br>drawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the<br>chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed<br>over him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go<br>away. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.<br>He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea<br>occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be<br>still alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,<br>he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more<br>over the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that<br>she was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw<br>clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He<br>was about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed<br>it was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of<br>blood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but<br>the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked<br>with blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but<br>something held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised<br>the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not<br>dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,<br>after two minutes’ hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off<br>without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a<br>purse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of<br>copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy<br>chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed<br>very full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,<br>flung the crosses on the old woman’s body and rushed back into the<br>bedroom, this time taking the axe with him.<br><br>He was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them<br>again. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It<br>was not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making<br>mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one<br>and would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered<br>and realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging<br>there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of<br>drawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,<br>and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest<br>of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old<br>women usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a<br>good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched<br>lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched<br>key fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was<br>a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,<br>then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but<br>clothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on<br>the red brocade. “It’s red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,”<br> the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.<br>“Good God, am I going out of my senses?” he thought with terror.<br><br>But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from<br>under the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned<br>out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably<br>all pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,<br>ear-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simply<br>wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with<br>tape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers<br>and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he<br>had not time to take many....<br><br>He suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped<br>short and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been<br>his fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though<br>someone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for<br>a minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited<br>holding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of<br>the bedroom.<br><br>In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.<br>She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet<br>and seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out<br>of the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a<br>shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but<br>still did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the<br>corner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no<br>sound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her<br>with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies’ mouths,<br>when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them<br>and are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so<br>simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not<br>even raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary<br>and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.<br>She only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding<br>it out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the<br>sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the<br>head. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,<br>snatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.<br><br>Fear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this<br>second, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place<br>as fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing<br>and reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the<br>difficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the<br>absurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,<br>perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of<br>that place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would<br>have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and<br>not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had<br>done. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew<br>stronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even<br>into the room for anything in the world.<br><br>But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take<br>possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what<br>was of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the<br>kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought<br>him of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.<br>He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap<br>that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands<br>in the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the<br>blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where<br>there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all<br>with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and<br>then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.<br>There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He<br>carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was<br>possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,<br>his trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be<br>nothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.<br>But he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something<br>quite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the<br>room, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea<br>that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,<br>of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something<br>utterly different from what he was now doing. “Good God!” he muttered “I<br>must fly, fly,” and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terror<br>awaited him such as he had never known before.<br><br>He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer<br>door from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,<br>was standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,<br>all the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him<br>perhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta<br>afterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that<br>she must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!<br><br>He dashed to the door and fastened the latch.<br><br>“But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away....”<br><br>He unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the<br>staircase.<br><br>He listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,<br>two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.<br>“What are they about?” He waited patiently. At last all was still, as<br>though suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,<br>but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone<br>began going downstairs humming a tune. “How is it they all make such<br>a noise?” flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door and<br>waited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking a<br>step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.<br><br>The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but<br>he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he<br>began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,<br>to the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow<br>peculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now<br>_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was<br>growing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And<br>now the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to<br>him all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream<br>in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is<br>rooted to the spot and cannot even move one’s arms.<br><br>At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly<br>started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the<br>flat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,<br>noiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had<br>done this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown<br>visitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one<br>another, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when<br>the door divided them and he was listening.<br><br>The visitor panted several times. “He must be a big, fat man,” thought<br>Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream<br>indeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.<br><br>As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of<br>something moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite<br>seriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently<br>and impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror<br>at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every<br>minute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem<br>possible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the<br>fastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him<br>again. “I shall fall down!” flashed through his mind, but the unknown<br>began to speak and he recovered himself at once.<br><br>“What’s up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!” he bawled in a<br>thick voice, “Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,<br>my beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?”<br><br>And again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at<br>the bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate<br>acquaintance.<br><br>At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the<br>stairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at<br>first.<br><br>“You don’t say there’s no one at home,” the new-comer cried in a<br>cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on<br>pulling the bell. “Good evening, Koch.”<br><br>“From his voice he must be quite young,” thought Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Who the devil can tell? I’ve almost broken the lock,” answered Koch.<br>“But how do you come to know me?”<br><br>“Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at<br>billiards at Gambrinus’.”<br><br>“Oh!”<br><br>“So they are not at home? That’s queer. It’s awfully stupid though.<br>Where could the old woman have gone? I’ve come on business.”<br><br>“Yes; and I have business with her, too.”<br><br>“Well, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to<br>get some money!” cried the young man.<br><br>“We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The<br>old witch fixed the time for me to come herself. It’s out of my way.<br>And where the devil she can have got to, I can’t make out. She sits here<br>from year’s end to year’s end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet<br>here all of a sudden she is out for a walk!”<br><br>“Hadn’t we better ask the porter?”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>“Where she’s gone and when she’ll be back.”<br><br>“Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go<br>anywhere.”<br><br>And he once more tugged at the door-handle.<br><br>“Damn it all. There’s nothing to be done, we must go!”<br><br>“Stay!” cried the young man suddenly. “Do you see how the door shakes if<br>you pull it?”<br><br>“Well?”<br><br>“That shows it’s not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how<br>the hook clanks?”<br><br>“Well?”<br><br>“Why, don’t you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they<br>were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the<br>key and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook<br>is clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,<br>don’t you see. So there they are sitting inside and don’t open the<br>door!”<br><br>“Well! And so they must be!” cried Koch, astonished. “What are they<br>about in there?” And he began furiously shaking the door.<br><br>“Stay!” cried the young man again. “Don’t pull at it! There must be<br>something wrong.... Here, you’ve been ringing and pulling at the door<br>and still they don’t open! So either they’ve both fainted or...”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>“I tell you what. Let’s go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.”<br><br>“All right.”<br><br>Both were going down.<br><br>“Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter.”<br><br>“What for?”<br><br>“Well, you’d better.”<br><br>“All right.”<br><br>“I’m studying the law you see! It’s evident, e-vi-dent there’s something<br>wrong here!” the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.<br><br>Koch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one<br>tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began<br>touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once<br>more that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he<br>bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock<br>on the inside and so nothing could be seen.<br><br>Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of<br>delirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.<br>While they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times<br>occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the<br>door. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,<br>while they could not open the door! “Only make haste!” was the thought<br>that flashed through his mind.<br><br>“But what the devil is he about?...” Time was passing, one minute, and<br>another--no one came. Koch began to be restless.<br><br>“What the devil?” he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his<br>sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy<br>boots on the stairs. The steps died away.<br><br>“Good heavens! What am I to do?”<br><br>Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.<br>Abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as<br>thoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.<br><br>He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice<br>below--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going<br>back to the flat.<br><br>“Hey there! Catch the brute!”<br><br>Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran<br>down the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.<br><br>“Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!”<br><br>The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was<br>still. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began<br>noisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He<br>distinguished the ringing voice of the young man. “Hey!”<br><br>Filled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling “come what<br>must!” If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was<br>lost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only<br>a flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the<br>right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the<br>second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though<br>for his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had just<br>run down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middle<br>of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one<br>instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall<br>and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.<br>Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He<br>waited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.<br><br>No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through<br>the gateway and turned to the left in the street.<br><br>He knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the<br>flat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as<br>the door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the<br>bodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and<br>completely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had<br>succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They would<br>guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were<br>going upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though<br>the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. “Should he<br>slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,<br>hopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,<br>hopeless!”<br><br>At last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.<br>Here he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky<br>because there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a<br>grain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could<br>scarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.<br>“My word, he has been going it!” someone shouted at him when he came out<br>on the canal bank.<br><br>He was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the<br>worse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal<br>bank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more<br>conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost<br>falling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from<br>quite a different direction.<br><br>He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his<br>house! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.<br>And yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to<br>escape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course<br>incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to<br>restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody’s yard. But<br>it all happened fortunately, the door of the porter’s room was closed<br>but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at<br>home. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he<br>walked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,<br>“What do you want?” he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. But<br>again the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe<br>back under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as<br>before. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;<br>the landlady’s door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himself<br>on the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank<br>forgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would have<br>jumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts were<br>simply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could<br>not rest on one, in spite of all his efforts....<br><br><br><br><br>PART II<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>So he lay a very long while. Now and then he seemed to wake up, and at<br>such moments he noticed that it was far into the night, but it did not<br>occur to him to get up. At last he noticed that it was beginning to get<br>light. He was lying on his back, still dazed from his recent oblivion.<br>Fearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he<br>heard every night, indeed, under his window after two o’clock. They woke<br>him up now.<br><br>“Ah! the drunken men are coming out of the taverns,” he thought, “it’s<br>past two o’clock,” and at once he leaped up, as though someone had<br>pulled him from the sofa.<br><br>“What! Past two o’clock!”<br><br>He sat down on the sofa--and instantly recollected everything! All at<br>once, in one flash, he recollected everything.<br><br>For the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill came<br>over him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in<br>his sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his<br>teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door and<br>began listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement he<br>gazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he<br>could have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have<br>flung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his<br>hat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.<br><br>“If anyone had come in, what would he have thought? That I’m drunk<br>but...”<br><br>He rushed to the window. There was light enough, and he began hurriedly<br>looking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there<br>no traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he<br>began taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everything<br>over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through<br>his search three times.<br><br>But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where<br>some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge<br>of his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed<br>threads. There seemed to be nothing more.<br><br>Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of<br>the old woman’s box were still in his pockets! He had not thought till<br>then of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them<br>while he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed<br>to take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out<br>everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was<br>nothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had<br>come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began<br>stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: “They’re in! All<br>out of sight, and the purse too!” he thought gleefully, getting up and<br>gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly<br>he shuddered all over with horror; “My God!” he whispered in despair:<br>“what’s the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hide<br>things?”<br><br>He had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought of<br>money, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.<br><br>“But now, now, what am I glad of?” he thought, “Is that hiding things?<br>My reason’s deserting me--simply!”<br><br>He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another<br>unbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside<br>him his old student’s winter coat, which was still warm though almost in<br>rags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and<br>delirium. He lost consciousness.<br><br>Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,<br>and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.<br><br>“How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not<br>taken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!<br>Such a piece of evidence!”<br><br>He pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits<br>among his linen under the pillow.<br><br>“Pieces of torn linen couldn’t rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I<br>think not, I think not, any way!” he repeated, standing in the middle<br>of the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about<br>him again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not<br>forgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,<br>and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an<br>insufferable torture.<br><br>“Surely it isn’t beginning already! Surely it isn’t my punishment coming<br>upon me? It is!”<br><br>The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the<br>floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!<br><br>“What is the matter with me!” he cried again, like one distraught.<br><br>Then a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes<br>were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many<br>stains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because<br>his perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was<br>clouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the<br>purse too. “Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put<br>the wet purse in my pocket!”<br><br>In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were<br>traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!<br><br>“So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and<br>memory, since I guessed it of myself,” he thought triumphantly, with<br>a deep sigh of relief; “it’s simply the weakness of fever, a moment’s<br>delirium,” and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his<br>trousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the<br>sock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He<br>flung off his boots; “traces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with<br>blood;” he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... “But what am I<br>to do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?”<br><br>He gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the<br>room.<br><br>“In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?<br>But what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, better<br>go out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away,” he<br>repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, “and at once, this minute,<br>without lingering...”<br><br>But his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy<br>shivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.<br><br>And for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to<br>“go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that<br>it may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!” Several times<br>he tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.<br><br>He was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.<br><br>“Open, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!” shouted<br>Nastasya, banging with her fist on the door. “For whole days together<br>he’s snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. It’s<br>past ten.”<br><br>“Maybe he’s not at home,” said a man’s voice.<br><br>“Ha! that’s the porter’s voice.... What does he want?”<br><br>He jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was a<br>positive pain.<br><br>“Then who can have latched the door?” retorted Nastasya. “He’s taken to<br>bolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wake<br>up!”<br><br>“What do they want? Why the porter? All’s discovered. Resist or open?<br>Come what may!...”<br><br>He half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.<br><br>His room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the<br>bed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.<br><br>Nastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and<br>desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded<br>paper sealed with bottle-wax.<br><br>“A notice from the office,” he announced, as he gave him the paper.<br><br>“From what office?”<br><br>“A summons to the police office, of course. You know which office.”<br><br>“To the police?... What for?...”<br><br>“How can I tell? You’re sent for, so you go.”<br><br>The man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to<br>go away.<br><br>“He’s downright ill!” observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.<br>The porter turned his head for a moment. “He’s been in a fever since<br>yesterday,” she added.<br><br>Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without<br>opening it. “Don’t you get up then,” Nastasya went on compassionately,<br>seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. “You’re ill, and<br>so don’t go; there’s no such hurry. What have you got there?”<br><br>He looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his<br>trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep<br>with them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that<br>half waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand<br>and so fallen asleep again.<br><br>“Look at the rags he’s collected and sleeps with them, as though he has<br>got hold of a treasure...”<br><br>And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.<br><br>Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his<br>eyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational<br>reflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that<br>with a person who was going to be arrested. “But... the police?”<br><br>“You’d better have some tea! Yes? I’ll bring it, there’s some left.”<br><br>“No... I’m going; I’ll go at once,” he muttered, getting on to his feet.<br><br>“Why, you’ll never get downstairs!”<br><br>“Yes, I’ll go.”<br><br>“As you please.”<br><br>She followed the porter out.<br><br>At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.<br><br>“There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,<br>and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could<br>distinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,<br>thank God!” Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began<br>reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an<br>ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at<br>half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.<br><br>“But when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with<br>the police! And why just to-day?” he thought in agonising bewilderment.<br>“Good God, only get it over soon!”<br><br>He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into<br>laughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.<br><br>He began, hurriedly dressing. “If I’m lost, I am lost, I don’t care!<br>Shall I put the sock on?” he suddenly wondered, “it will get dustier<br>still and the traces will be gone.”<br><br>But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing<br>and horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,<br>he picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.<br><br>“That’s all conventional, that’s all relative, merely a way of looking<br>at it,” he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his<br>mind, while he was shuddering all over, “there, I’ve got it on! I have<br>finished by getting it on!”<br><br>But his laughter was quickly followed by despair.<br><br>“No, it’s too much for me...” he thought. His legs shook. “From fear,”<br> he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. “It’s a trick! They<br>want to decoy me there and confound me over everything,” he mused, as<br>he went out on to the stairs--“the worst of it is I’m almost<br>light-headed... I may blurt out something stupid...”<br><br>On the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as<br>they were in the hole in the wall, “and very likely, it’s on purpose<br>to search when I’m out,” he thought, and stopped short. But he was<br>possessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call<br>it, that with a wave of his hand he went on. “Only to get it over!”<br><br>In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had<br>fallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench<br>from the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish<br>pedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,<br>so that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going<br>round--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the<br>street on a bright sunny day.<br><br>When he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of<br>trepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted<br>his eyes.<br><br>“If they question me, perhaps I’ll simply tell,” he thought, as he drew<br>near the police-station.<br><br>The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been<br>moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once<br>for a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,<br>he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with<br>a book in his hand. “A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is<br>here,” and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not want<br>to ask questions of anyone.<br><br>“I’ll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything...” he thought, as<br>he reached the fourth floor.<br><br>The staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The<br>kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost<br>the whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase<br>was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their<br>arms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of<br>the office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,<br>too, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh<br>paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.<br><br>After waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.<br>All the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him<br>on and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some<br>clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a<br>queer-looking set. He went up to one of them.<br><br>“What is it?”<br><br>He showed the notice he had received.<br><br>“You are a student?” the man asked, glancing at the notice.<br><br>“Yes, formerly a student.”<br><br>The clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was a<br>particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.<br><br>“There would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no<br>interest in anything,” thought Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Go in there to the head clerk,” said the clerk, pointing towards the<br>furthest room.<br><br>He went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and<br>packed full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.<br>Among them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the<br>table opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.<br>The other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,<br>excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a<br>saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.<br>Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced<br>at it, said: “Wait a minute,” and went on attending to the lady in<br>mourning.<br><br>He breathed more freely. “It can’t be that!”<br><br>By degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have<br>courage and be calm.<br><br>“Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!<br>Hm... it’s a pity there’s no air here,” he added, “it’s stifling.... It<br>makes one’s head dizzier than ever... and one’s mind too...”<br><br>He was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing<br>his self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,<br>something quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet<br>the head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him<br>and guess something from his face.<br><br>He was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile<br>face that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and<br>foppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,<br>and wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain<br>on his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who<br>was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.<br><br>“Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,” he said casually to the<br>gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not<br>venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.<br><br>“Ich danke,” said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank<br>into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated<br>about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She<br>smelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half<br>the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was<br>impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.<br><br>The lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, with<br>some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of<br>his shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and<br>sat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her<br>seat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the<br>officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to<br>sit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He<br>had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his<br>face, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except<br>a certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly at<br>Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his<br>humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his<br>clothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on<br>him, so that he felt positively affronted.<br><br>“What do you want?” he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged<br>fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.<br><br>“I was summoned... by a notice...” Raskolnikov faltered.<br><br>“For the recovery of money due, from _the student_,” the head clerk<br>interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers. “Here!” and he<br>flung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. “Read that!”<br><br>“Money? What money?” thought Raskolnikov, “but... then... it’s certainly<br>not _that_.”<br><br>And he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A<br>load was lifted from his back.<br><br>“And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?” shouted the<br>assistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more<br>aggrieved. “You are told to come at nine, and now it’s twelve!”<br><br>“The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago,” Raskolnikov<br>answered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grew<br>suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. “And it’s enough that<br>I have come here ill with fever.”<br><br>“Kindly refrain from shouting!”<br><br>“I’m not shouting, I’m speaking very quietly, it’s you who are shouting<br>at me. I’m a student, and allow no one to shout at me.”<br><br>The assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he<br>could only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.<br><br>“Be silent! You are in a government office. Don’t be impudent, sir!”<br><br>“You’re in a government office, too,” cried Raskolnikov, “and you’re<br>smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect<br>to all of us.”<br><br>He felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.<br><br>The head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistant<br>superintendent was obviously disconcerted.<br><br>“That’s not your business!” he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.<br>“Kindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. Alexandr<br>Grigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You don’t pay your<br>debts! You’re a fine bird!”<br><br>But Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the<br>paper, in haste to find an explanation. He read it once, and a second<br>time, and still did not understand.<br><br>“What is this?” he asked the head clerk.<br><br>“It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You must<br>either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written<br>declaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not<br>to leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your<br>property. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed<br>against you according to the law.”<br><br>“But I... am not in debt to anyone!”<br><br>“That’s not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen<br>roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us<br>for recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine<br>months ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.<br>We therefore summon you, hereupon.”<br><br>“But she is my landlady!”<br><br>“And what if she is your landlady?”<br><br>The head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,<br>and at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire<br>for the first time--as though he would say: “Well, how do you feel now?”<br> But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that<br>worth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, he<br>read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but<br>all mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from<br>overwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment<br>without thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions<br>or surmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an instant<br>of full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment<br>something like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistant<br>superintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov’s disrespect, still fuming<br>and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the<br>unfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in<br>with an exceedingly silly smile.<br><br>“You shameful hussy!” he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (The<br>lady in mourning had left the office.) “What was going on at your house<br>last night? Eh! A disgrace again, you’re a scandal to the whole street.<br>Fighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why,<br>I have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the<br>eleventh! And here you are again, again, you... you...!”<br><br>The paper fell out of Raskolnikov’s hands, and he looked wildly at the<br>smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what it<br>meant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He<br>listened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his<br>nerves were on edge.<br><br>“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped<br>short, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not<br>be stopped except by force.<br><br>As for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the<br>storm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of<br>abuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the<br>smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and<br>curtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her<br>word: and at last she found it.<br><br>“There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain,” she<br>pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently,<br>though with a strong German accent, “and no sort of scandal, and his<br>honour came drunk, and it’s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,<br>and I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,<br>and honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any<br>scandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles<br>again, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte<br>with one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and<br>he _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said<br>so. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And then<br>I called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the<br>eye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the<br>cheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,<br>and I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in<br>the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea of<br>squealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!<br>And Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,<br>Mr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_<br>pay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, five<br>roubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused<br>all the scandal. ‘I will show you up,’ he said, ‘for I can write to all<br>the papers about you.’”<br><br>“Then he was an author?”<br><br>“Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable<br>house....”<br><br>“Now then! Enough! I have told you already...”<br><br>“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk repeated significantly.<br><br>The assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his<br>head.<br><br>“... So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it<br>you for the last time,” the assistant went on. “If there is a scandal<br>in your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the<br>lock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literary<br>man, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an ‘honourable<br>house’? A nice set, these authors!”<br><br>And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. “There was a scandal<br>the other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner and<br>would not pay; ‘I’ll write a satire on you,’ says he. And there was<br>another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful<br>language to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and<br>daughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner’s shop<br>the other day. They are like that, authors, literary men, students,<br>town-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one<br>day. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?”<br><br>With hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all<br>directions, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, she<br>stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open<br>face and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent of<br>the district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste<br>to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she<br>fluttered out of the office.<br><br>“Again thunder and lightning--a hurricane!” said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya<br>Petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. “You are aroused again, you are<br>fuming again! I heard it on the stairs!”<br><br>“Well, what then!” Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;<br>and he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of<br>his shoulders at each step. “Here, if you will kindly look: an author,<br>or a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given<br>an I O U, won’t clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly<br>being lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest<br>against my smoking in his presence! He behaves like a cad himself, and<br>just look at him, please. Here’s the gentleman, and very attractive he<br>is!”<br><br>“Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder,<br>you can’t bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something and<br>went too far yourself,” continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to<br>Raskolnikov. “But you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure<br>you, but explosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no<br>stopping him! And then it’s all over! And at the bottom he’s a heart of<br>gold! His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant....”<br><br>“And what a regiment it was, too,” cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratified<br>at this agreeable banter, though still sulky.<br><br>Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant<br>to them all. “Excuse me, Captain,” he began easily, suddenly addressing<br>Nikodim Fomitch, “will you enter into my position?... I am ready to<br>ask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick<br>and shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not<br>studying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... I<br>have a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to<br>me, and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so<br>exasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the<br>last four months, that she does not even send up my dinner... and I<br>don’t understand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this<br>I O U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves!...”<br><br>“But that is not our business, you know,” the head clerk was observing.<br><br>“Yes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain...”<br> Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying<br>his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently<br>appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously<br>oblivious of him. “Allow me to explain that I have been living with her<br>for nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I not<br>confess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, it<br>was a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, I liked<br>her, though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...<br>that is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those<br>days, and I led a life of... I was very heedless...”<br><br>“Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we’ve no time to<br>waste,” Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph;<br>but Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it<br>exceedingly difficult to speak.<br><br>“But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all<br>happened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.<br>But a year ago, the girl died of typhus. I remained lodging there as<br>before, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she said<br>to me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me,<br>but still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen<br>roubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that,<br>she would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never,<br>never--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay<br>of myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to<br>eat, she takes action against me. What am I to say to that?”<br><br>“All these affecting details are no business of ours.” Ilya Petrovitch<br>interrupted rudely. “You must give a written undertaking but as for your<br>love affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with<br>that.”<br><br>“Come now... you are harsh,” muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at<br>the table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.<br><br>“Write!” said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Write what?” the latter asked, gruffly.<br><br>“I will dictate to you.”<br><br>Raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and<br>contemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt<br>completely indifferent to anyone’s opinion, and this revulsion took<br>place in a flash, in one instant. If he had cared to think a little,<br>he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like<br>that a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where had<br>those feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled, not<br>with police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he<br>would not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart. A<br>gloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took<br>conscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimental<br>effusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter’s<br>triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.<br>Oh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty<br>vanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices? If he had been<br>sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would<br>hardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening to<br>him entirely new, sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood, but<br>he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could<br>never more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental<br>effusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that<br>if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers,<br>it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any<br>circumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awful<br>sensation. And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a<br>conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the<br>sensations he had known in his life.<br><br>The head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration,<br>that he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, that<br>he would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on.<br><br>“But you can’t write, you can hardly hold the pen,” observed the head<br>clerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. “Are you ill?”<br><br>“Yes, I am giddy. Go on!”<br><br>“That’s all. Sign it.”<br><br>The head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others.<br><br>Raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away,<br>he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands. He<br>felt as if a nail were being driven into his skull. A strange idea<br>suddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to Nikodim<br>Fomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and then<br>to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole<br>in the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat<br>to carry it out. “Hadn’t I better think a minute?” flashed through his<br>mind. “No, better cast off the burden without thinking.” But all at once<br>he stood still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly<br>with Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him:<br><br>“It’s impossible, they’ll both be released. To begin with, the whole<br>story contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter, if it<br>had been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No,<br>that would be too cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at<br>the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walking<br>with three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the<br>porters to direct him, in the presence of the friends. Now, would he<br>have asked his way if he had been going with such an object? As for<br>Koch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith’s below, before he went<br>up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Now<br>just consider...”<br><br>“But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? They state<br>themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes<br>later when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was<br>unfastened.”<br><br>“That’s just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself<br>in; and they’d have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been<br>an ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized the<br>interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing<br>himself and saying: ‘If I had been there, he would have jumped out and<br>killed me with his axe.’ He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha,<br>ha!”<br><br>“And no one saw the murderer?”<br><br>“They might well not see him; the house is a regular Noah’s Ark,” said<br>the head clerk, who was listening.<br><br>“It’s clear, quite clear,” Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly.<br><br>“No, it is anything but clear,” Ilya Petrovitch maintained.<br><br>Raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he did<br>not reach it....<br><br>When he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair,<br>supported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing<br>on the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and<br>Nikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him. He got up<br>from the chair.<br><br>“What’s this? Are you ill?” Nikodim Fomitch asked, rather sharply.<br><br>“He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing,” said the head clerk,<br>settling back in his place, and taking up his work again.<br><br>“Have you been ill long?” cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place, where<br>he, too, was looking through papers. He had, of course, come to look at<br>the sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered.<br><br>“Since yesterday,” muttered Raskolnikov in reply.<br><br>“Did you go out yesterday?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Though you were ill?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“At what time?”<br><br>“About seven.”<br><br>“And where did you go, may I ask?”<br><br>“Along the street.”<br><br>“Short and clear.”<br><br>Raskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily,<br>without dropping his black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitch’s stare.<br><br>“He can scarcely stand upright. And you...” Nikodim Fomitch was<br>beginning.<br><br>“No matter,” Ilya Petrovitch pronounced rather peculiarly.<br><br>Nikodim Fomitch would have made some further protest, but glancing at<br>the head clerk who was looking very hard at him, he did not speak. There<br>was a sudden silence. It was strange.<br><br>“Very well, then,” concluded Ilya Petrovitch, “we will not detain you.”<br><br>Raskolnikov went out. He caught the sound of eager conversation on his<br>departure, and above the rest rose the questioning voice of Nikodim<br>Fomitch. In the street, his faintness passed off completely.<br><br>“A search--there will be a search at once,” he repeated to himself,<br>hurrying home. “The brutes! they suspect.”<br><br>His former terror mastered him completely again.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>“And what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my<br>room?”<br><br>But here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in.<br>Even Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he have left<br>all those things in the hole?<br><br>He rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the<br>things out and lined his pockets with them. There were eight articles in<br>all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly<br>looked to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain, too,<br>merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked<br>like a decoration.... He put them all in the different pockets of his<br>overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal<br>them as much as possible. He took the purse, too. Then he went out of<br>his room, leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely, and<br>though he felt shattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of<br>pursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an<br>hour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at<br>all costs, he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everything<br>up while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him....<br>Where was he to go?<br><br>That had long been settled: “Fling them into the canal, and all traces<br>hidden in the water, the thing would be at an end.” So he had decided in<br>the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to<br>get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get<br>rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along<br>the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked<br>several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not<br>think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps’ edge,<br>and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and<br>people were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed<br>from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go<br>down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what if<br>the boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.<br>Even as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if<br>they had nothing to do but to watch him. “Why is it, or can it be my<br>fancy?” he thought.<br><br>At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the<br>Neva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,<br>and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further<br>off. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,<br>worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it<br>before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply<br>because he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent<br>and forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.<br><br>He walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way<br>another idea struck him. “Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to go<br>somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things<br>in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot<br>perhaps?” And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea<br>seemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For<br>coming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a<br>passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right<br>hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far<br>into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for<br>twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here<br>was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was<br>lying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,<br>apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It<br>was probably a carriage builder’s or carpenter’s shed; the whole place<br>from the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to<br>throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and<br>at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where<br>there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had<br>been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, “Standing here<br>strictly forbidden.” This was all the better, for there would be nothing<br>suspicious about his going in. “Here I could throw it all in a heap and<br>get away!”<br><br>Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed<br>against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn<br>stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a<br>street. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he<br>could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the<br>street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.<br><br>He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,<br>and using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small<br>hollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.<br>The purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he<br>seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was<br>in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But<br>he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.<br>Nothing could be noticed.<br><br>Then he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,<br>almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in<br>the police-office. “I have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of<br>looking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since<br>the house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were<br>found, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!” And he laughed.<br>Yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless<br>laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But<br>when he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come<br>upon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his<br>mind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat<br>on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it<br>would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had<br>given the twenty copecks: “Damn him!”<br><br>He walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now<br>seemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there<br>really was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that<br>point--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.<br><br>“Damn it all!” he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.<br>“If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how<br>stupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned<br>upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I<br>care for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It<br>is not that at all!”<br><br>Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple<br>question perplexed and bitterly confounded him.<br><br>“If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if<br>I really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even<br>glance into the purse and don’t know what I had there, for which I have<br>undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,<br>filthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the<br>water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen<br>either... how’s that?”<br><br>Yes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and<br>it was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night<br>without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though<br>it could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, and<br>understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the<br>moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out<br>of it.... Yes, so it was.<br><br>“It is because I am very ill,” he decided grimly at last, “I have been<br>worrying and fretting myself, and I don’t know what I am doing....<br>Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been<br>worrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what<br>if I don’t get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!”<br><br>He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some<br>distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new<br>overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him<br>every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for<br>everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.<br>All who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their<br>movements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he<br>might have spat at him or bitten him....<br><br>He stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near<br>the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. “Why, he lives here, in that house,”<br> he thought, “why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here<br>it’s the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though;<br>have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never<br>mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the<br>day _after_; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further<br>now.”<br><br>He went up to Razumihin’s room on the fifth floor.<br><br>The latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and<br>he opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each<br>other. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on<br>his bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.<br><br>“Is it you?” he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a<br>brief pause, he whistled. “As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you’ve<br>cut me out!” he added, looking at Raskolnikov’s rags. “Come sit down,<br>you are tired, I’ll be bound.”<br><br>And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was<br>in even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his<br>visitor was ill.<br><br>“Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?” He began feeling his<br>pulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.<br><br>“Never mind,” he said, “I have come for this: I have no lessons.... I<br>wanted,... but I don’t really want lessons....”<br><br>“But I say! You are delirious, you know!” Razumihin observed, watching<br>him carefully.<br><br>“No, I am not.”<br><br>Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to<br>Razumihin’s, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend<br>face to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all<br>disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the<br>wide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at<br>himself as soon as he crossed Razumihin’s threshold.<br><br>“Good-bye,” he said abruptly, and walked to the door.<br><br>“Stop, stop! You queer fish.”<br><br>“I don’t want to,” said the other, again pulling away his hand.<br><br>“Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this<br>is... almost insulting! I won’t let you go like that.”<br><br>“Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could<br>help... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone--cleverer, I<br>mean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear?<br>Nothing at all... no one’s services... no one’s sympathy. I am by<br>myself... alone. Come, that’s enough. Leave me alone.”<br><br>“Stay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for all<br>I care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I don’t care about that, but<br>there’s a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.<br>I would not exchange him for five lessons. He’s doing publishing of a<br>kind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they<br>have! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I<br>was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!<br>Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of<br>anything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of<br>the German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses<br>the question, ‘Is woman a human being?’ And, of course, triumphantly<br>proves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a<br>contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand<br>these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous<br>title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He<br>pays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles<br>for the job, and I’ve had six already in advance. When we have finished<br>this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of<br>the dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have<br>marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was<br>a kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I don’t contradict him, hang him!<br>Well, would you like to do the second signature of ‘_Is woman a human<br>being?_’ If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those<br>are provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in<br>advance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.<br>And when you have finished the signature there will be another three<br>roubles for you. And please don’t think I am doing you a service; quite<br>the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to<br>begin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly<br>adrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part.<br>The only comfort is, that it’s bound to be a change for the better.<br>Though who can tell, maybe it’s sometimes for the worse. Will you take<br>it?”<br><br>Raskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles<br>and without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment.<br>But when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the<br>stairs to Razumihin’s again and laying on the table the German article<br>and the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word.<br><br>“Are you raving, or what?” Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last.<br>“What farce is this? You’ll drive me crazy too... what did you come to<br>see me for, damn you?”<br><br>“I don’t want... translation,” muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs.<br><br>“Then what the devil do you want?” shouted Razumihin from above.<br>Raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence.<br><br>“Hey, there! Where are you living?”<br><br>No answer.<br><br>“Well, confound you then!”<br><br>But Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the Nikolaevsky<br>Bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant<br>incident. A coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave him<br>a violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under<br>his horses’ hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the<br>railing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle<br>of the bridge in the traffic). He angrily clenched and ground his teeth.<br>He heard laughter, of course.<br><br>“Serves him right!”<br><br>“A pickpocket I dare say.”<br><br>“Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on<br>purpose; and you have to answer for him.”<br><br>“It’s a regular profession, that’s what it is.”<br><br>But while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered<br>after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt<br>someone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly woman<br>in a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter,<br>wearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol.<br><br>“Take it, my good man, in Christ’s name.”<br><br>He took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. From<br>his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar<br>asking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he<br>doubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him.<br><br>He closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and<br>turned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was without<br>a cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the<br>Neva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the<br>bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,<br>and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.<br>The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one<br>uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood<br>still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was<br>especially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had<br>hundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,<br>gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at<br>a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely<br>cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered<br>every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting<br>himself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled<br>those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was<br>no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and<br>grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,<br>as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be<br>interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...<br>so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his<br>heart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him<br>now--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,<br>his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... He<br>felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing<br>from his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he<br>suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his<br>hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into<br>the water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut<br>himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.<br><br>Evening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been<br>walking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.<br>Undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the<br>sofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion....<br><br>It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a<br>scream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,<br>blows and curses he had never heard.<br><br>He could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror he<br>sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing<br>and cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement<br>he caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and<br>wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make<br>out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be<br>beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of<br>her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost<br>a croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly<br>and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov<br>trembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.<br>Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,<br>banging her head against the steps--that’s clear, that can be told<br>from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world<br>topsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys<br>and all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors<br>banging. “But why, why, and how could it be?” he repeated, thinking<br>seriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And<br>they would come to him then next, “for no doubt... it’s all about<br>that... about yesterday.... Good God!” He would have fastened his door<br>with the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would<br>be useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed<br>him.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,<br>began gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya<br>Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he,<br>too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. “Can he have<br>gone away? Good Lord!” Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still<br>weeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was<br>going from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling<br>to one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a<br>whisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates<br>of the block. “But, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he come<br>here!”<br><br>Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes. He<br>lay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of<br>infinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright<br>light flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate<br>of soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not<br>asleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she<br>had brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.<br><br>“You’ve eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You’ve been trudging<br>about all day, and you’re shaking with fever.”<br><br>“Nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?”<br><br>She looked intently at him.<br><br>“Who beat the landlady?”<br><br>“Just now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant<br>superintendent, on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that,<br>and... why was he here?”<br><br>Nastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a<br>long time. He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes.<br><br>“Nastasya, why don’t you speak?” he said timidly at last in a weak<br>voice.<br><br>“It’s the blood,” she answered at last softly, as though speaking to<br>herself.<br><br>“Blood? What blood?” he muttered, growing white and turning towards the<br>wall.<br><br>Nastasya still looked at him without speaking.<br><br>“Nobody has been beating the landlady,” she declared at last in a firm,<br>resolute voice.<br><br>He gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.<br><br>“I heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up,” he<br>said still more timidly. “I listened a long while. The assistant<br>superintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the<br>flats.”<br><br>“No one has been here. That’s the blood crying in your ears. When<br>there’s no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying<br>things.... Will you eat something?”<br><br>He made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, watching him.<br><br>“Give me something to drink... Nastasya.”<br><br>She went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.<br>He remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling<br>some on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>He was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he<br>was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.<br>He remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though<br>there were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away<br>somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about<br>him. Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid<br>of him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;<br>they threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked<br>at him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished<br>another person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could<br>not remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.<br>Sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times<br>it all seemed part of the same day. But of _that_--of _that_ he had<br>no recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten<br>something he ought to remember. He worried and tormented himself trying<br>to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable<br>terror. Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone<br>always prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and<br>forgetfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.<br><br>It happened at ten o’clock in the morning. On fine days the sun shone<br>into the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right<br>wall and the corner near the door. Nastasya was standing beside him<br>with another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him<br>very inquisitively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full,<br>short-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady was<br>peeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov sat up.<br><br>“Who is this, Nastasya?” he asked, pointing to the young man.<br><br>“I say, he’s himself again!” she said.<br><br>“He is himself,” echoed the man.<br><br>Concluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the<br>door and disappeared. She was always shy and dreaded conversations or<br>discussions. She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat<br>and buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and<br>laziness, and absurdly bashful.<br><br>“Who... are you?” he went on, addressing the man. But at that moment<br>the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall,<br>Razumihin came in.<br><br>“What a cabin it is!” he cried. “I am always knocking my head. You call<br>this a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? I’ve just heard the news<br>from Pashenka.”<br><br>“He has just come to,” said Nastasya.<br><br>“Just come to,” echoed the man again, with a smile.<br><br>“And who are you?” Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him. “My name is<br>Vrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but<br>Vrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are<br>you?”<br><br>“I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and<br>I’ve come on business.”<br><br>“Please sit down.” Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the<br>table. “It’s a good thing you’ve come to, brother,” he went on to<br>Raskolnikov. “For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk<br>anything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see<br>you twice. You remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said at<br>once it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.<br>Some nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not<br>had enough beer and radish, but it’s nothing much, it will pass and you<br>will be all right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a<br>name. Come, I won’t keep you,” he said, addressing the man again. “Will<br>you explain what you want? You must know, Rodya, this is the second time<br>they have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I<br>talked to him. Who was it came before?”<br><br>“That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please,<br>sir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office, too.”<br><br>“He was more intelligent than you, don’t you think so?”<br><br>“Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am.”<br><br>“Quite so; go on.”<br><br>“At your mamma’s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom<br>I presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to you<br>from our office,” the man began, addressing Raskolnikov. “If you are in<br>an intelligible condition, I’ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as<br>Semyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma’s<br>request instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions. Do you<br>know him, sir?”<br><br>“Yes, I remember... Vahrushin,” Raskolnikov said dreamily.<br><br>“You hear, he knows Vahrushin,” cried Razumihin. “He is in ‘an<br>intelligible condition’! And I see you are an intelligent man too. Well,<br>it’s always pleasant to hear words of wisdom.”<br><br>“That’s the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. And at the request<br>of your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the<br>same manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent<br>instructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you<br>thirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come.”<br><br>“That ‘hoping for better to come’ is the best thing you’ve said, though<br>‘your mamma’ is not bad either. Come then, what do you say? Is he fully<br>conscious, eh?”<br><br>“That’s all right. If only he can sign this little paper.”<br><br>“He can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?”<br><br>“Yes, here’s the book.”<br><br>“Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I’ll hold you. Take the pen and<br>scribble ‘Raskolnikov’ for him. For just now, brother, money is sweeter<br>to us than treacle.”<br><br>“I don’t want it,” said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.<br><br>“Not want it?”<br><br>“I won’t sign it.”<br><br>“How the devil can you do without signing it?”<br><br>“I don’t want... the money.”<br><br>“Don’t want the money! Come, brother, that’s nonsense, I bear witness.<br>Don’t trouble, please, it’s only that he is on his travels again. But<br>that’s pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man of<br>judgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his<br>hand and he will sign it. Here.”<br><br>“But I can come another time.”<br><br>“No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment.... Now,<br>Rodya, don’t keep your visitor, you see he is waiting,” and he made<br>ready to hold Raskolnikov’s hand in earnest.<br><br>“Stop, I’ll do it alone,” said the latter, taking the pen and signing<br>his name.<br><br>The messenger took out the money and went away.<br><br>“Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?”<br><br>“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Is there any soup?”<br><br>“Some of yesterday’s,” answered Nastasya, who was still standing there.<br><br>“With potatoes and rice in it?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“I know it by heart. Bring soup and give us some tea.”<br><br>“Very well.”<br><br>Raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull,<br>unreasoning terror. He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what<br>would happen. “I believe I am not wandering. I believe it’s reality,” he<br>thought.<br><br>In a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced<br>that the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she brought two<br>spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on. The<br>table was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.<br><br>“It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us<br>up a couple of bottles of beer. We could empty them.”<br><br>“Well, you are a cool hand,” muttered Nastasya, and she departed to<br>carry out his orders.<br><br>Raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. Meanwhile<br>Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his<br>left arm round Raskolnikov’s head, although he was able to sit up, and<br>with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that<br>it might not burn him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov<br>swallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. But after<br>giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and<br>said that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more.<br><br>Nastasya came in with two bottles of beer.<br><br>“And will you have tea?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Cut along, Nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on<br>without the faculty. But here is the beer!” He moved back to his chair,<br>pulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he<br>had not touched food for three days.<br><br>“I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now,” he<br>mumbled with his mouth full of beef, “and it’s all Pashenka, your dear<br>little landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. I<br>don’t ask for it, but, of course, I don’t object. And here’s Nastasya<br>with the tea. She is a quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won’t you have<br>some beer?”<br><br>“Get along with your nonsense!”<br><br>“A cup of tea, then?”<br><br>“A cup of tea, maybe.”<br><br>“Pour it out. Stay, I’ll pour it out myself. Sit down.”<br><br>He poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. As<br>before, he put his left arm round the sick man’s head, raised him up<br>and gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and<br>earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective<br>means towards his friend’s recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made<br>no resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa<br>without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but<br>even perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer, almost<br>animal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying<br>low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession<br>of his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.<br>Yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen<br>spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away<br>capriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real<br>pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed<br>that, too, and took note of it.<br><br>“Pashenka must give us some raspberry jam to-day to make him some<br>raspberry tea,” said Razumihin, going back to his chair and attacking<br>his soup and beer again.<br><br>“And where is she to get raspberries for you?” asked Nastasya, balancing<br>a saucer on her five outspread fingers and sipping tea through a lump of<br>sugar.<br><br>“She’ll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts of things<br>have been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped in<br>that rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I<br>resolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day.<br>How I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had<br>forgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know<br>it; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the<br>Five Corners, Harlamov’s house. I kept trying to find that Harlamov’s<br>house, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov’s, but<br>Buch’s. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and I<br>went on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in<br>two minutes they looked you up! Your name is down there.”<br><br>“My name!”<br><br>“I should think so; and yet a General Kobelev they could not find while<br>I was there. Well, it’s a long story. But as soon as I did land on this<br>place, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, I know<br>everything; Nastasya here will tell you. I made the acquaintance of<br>Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.<br>Zametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office,<br>and, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows....”<br><br>“He’s got round her,” Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.<br><br>“Why don’t you put the sugar in your tea, Nastasya Nikiforovna?”<br><br>“You are a one!” Nastasya cried suddenly, going off into a giggle. “I am<br>not Nikiforovna, but Petrovna,” she added suddenly, recovering from her<br>mirth.<br><br>“I’ll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story short,<br>I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant<br>influences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day. I had not<br>expected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing. Eh, what do you<br>think?”<br><br>Raskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him,<br>full of alarm.<br><br>“And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,” Razumihin went<br>on, not at all embarrassed by his silence.<br><br>“Ah, the sly dog!” Nastasya shrieked again. This conversation afforded<br>her unspeakable delight.<br><br>“It’s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way<br>at first. You ought to have approached her differently. She is, so<br>to speak, a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about her<br>character later.... How could you let things come to such a pass that<br>she gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been<br>mad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter,<br>Natalya Yegorovna, was alive?... I know all about it! But I see that’s<br>a delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. But, talking of<br>foolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as<br>you would think at first sight?”<br><br>“No,” mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better<br>to keep up the conversation.<br><br>“She isn’t, is she?” cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer out<br>of him. “But she is not very clever either, eh? She is essentially,<br>essentially an unaccountable character! I am sometimes quite at a loss,<br>I assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and<br>of course she has every right to say so. But I swear I judge her<br>intellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a<br>sort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!<br>I don’t understand it! Well, that’s all nonsense. Only, seeing that you<br>are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and<br>that through the young lady’s death she has no need to treat you as<br>a relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and<br>dropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.<br>And she’s been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose<br>the I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay.”<br><br>“It was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almost<br>a beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,”<br> Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.<br><br>“Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that point<br>Mr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pashenka would never have<br>thought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but<br>the business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the<br>question, ‘Is there any hope of realising the I O U?’ Answer: there is,<br>because he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and<br>twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,<br>too, who would go into bondage for his sake. That’s what he was building<br>upon.... Why do you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairs<br>now, my dear boy--it’s not for nothing that you were so open with<br>Pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as<br>a friend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is<br>open; and a business man ‘listens and goes on eating’ you up. Well,<br>then she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without<br>hesitation he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all this<br>I wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time<br>harmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping<br>the whole affair, engaging that you would pay. I went security for you,<br>brother. Do you understand? We called Tchebarov, flung him ten<br>roubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour of<br>presenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here, take it, you see I<br>have torn it.”<br><br>Razumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him and<br>turned to the wall without uttering a word. Even Razumihin felt a<br>twinge.<br><br>“I see, brother,” he said a moment later, “that I have been playing the<br>fool again. I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believe<br>I have only made you cross.”<br><br>“Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?” Raskolnikov<br>asked, after a moment’s pause without turning his head.<br><br>“Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought<br>Zametov one day.”<br><br>“Zametov? The head clerk? What for?” Raskolnikov turned round quickly<br>and fixed his eyes on Razumihin.<br><br>“What’s the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted to<br>make your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How<br>could I have found out so much except from him? He is a capital<br>fellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course. Now we are<br>friends--see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part,<br>you know. I have only just moved. I’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna<br>once or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?<br><br>“Did I say anything in delirium?”<br><br>“I should think so! You were beside yourself.”<br><br>“What did I rave about?”<br><br>“What next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well,<br>brother, now I must not lose time. To work.” He got up from the table<br>and took up his cap.<br><br>“What did I rave about?”<br><br>“How he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Don’t<br>worry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. But you said a lot<br>about a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky<br>Island, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the<br>assistant superintendent. And another thing that was of special interest<br>to you was your own sock. You whined, ‘Give me my sock.’ Zametov<br>hunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented,<br>ring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag. And only then were you<br>comforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched<br>thing in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likely<br>somewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked so<br>piteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to find out what sort<br>of fringe, but we could not make it out. Now to business! Here are<br>thirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account<br>of them in an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time,<br>though he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve. And<br>you, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he<br>wants a drink or anything else. And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted<br>myself. Good-bye!”<br><br>“He calls her Pashenka! Ah, he’s a deep one!” said Nastasya as he went<br>out; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist<br>running downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he would<br>say to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.<br><br>No sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the<br>bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With burning, twitching<br>impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to<br>work. But to what work? Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him.<br><br>“Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? What<br>if they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,<br>and then they will come in and tell me that it’s been discovered long<br>ago and that they have only... What am I to do now? That’s what I’ve<br>forgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered<br>a minute ago.”<br><br>He stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment<br>about him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not<br>what he wanted. Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to<br>the corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it,<br>put his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it. He went to the<br>stove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of<br>his trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as<br>he had thrown them. No one had looked, then! Then he remembered the sock<br>about which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes, there it lay on<br>the sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that<br>Zametov could not have seen anything on it.<br><br>“Bah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for to the police<br>office? Where’s the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then. I<br>looked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. But<br>what did Zametov come for? Why did Razumihin bring him?” he muttered,<br>helplessly sitting on the sofa again. “What does it mean? Am I still in<br>delirium, or is it real? I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I must<br>escape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape! Yes... but<br>where? And where are my clothes? I’ve no boots. They’ve taken them away!<br>They’ve hidden them! I understand! Ah, here is my coat--they passed that<br>over! And here is money on the table, thank God! And here’s the I O U...<br>I’ll take the money and go and take another lodging. They won’t find<br>me!... Yes, but the address bureau? They’ll find me, Razumihin will find<br>me. Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let them<br>do their worst! And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What<br>else shall I take? They think I am ill! They don’t know that I can walk,<br>ha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If<br>only I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watch<br>there--policemen! What’s this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half a<br>bottle, cold!”<br><br>He snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and<br>gulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.<br>But in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and<br>even pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled the<br>quilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more<br>disconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him. With<br>a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more<br>closely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old,<br>ragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing<br>sleep.<br><br>He woke up, hearing someone come in. He opened his eyes and saw<br>Razumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or<br>not. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though<br>trying to recall something.<br><br>“Ah, you are not asleep! Here I am! Nastasya, bring in the parcel!”<br> Razumihin shouted down the stairs. “You shall have the account<br>directly.”<br><br>“What time is it?” asked Raskolnikov, looking round uneasily.<br><br>“Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it’s almost evening, it will be six<br>o’clock directly. You have slept more than six hours.”<br><br>“Good heavens! Have I?”<br><br>“And why not? It will do you good. What’s the hurry? A tryst, is it?<br>We’ve all time before us. I’ve been waiting for the last three hours for<br>you; I’ve been up twice and found you asleep. I’ve called on Zossimov<br>twice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. And<br>I’ve been out on my own business, too. You know I’ve been moving to-day,<br>moving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But that’s<br>no matter, to business. Give me the parcel, Nastasya. We will open it<br>directly. And how do you feel now, brother?”<br><br>“I am quite well, I am not ill. Razumihin, have you been here long?”<br><br>“I tell you I’ve been waiting for the last three hours.”<br><br>“No, before.”<br><br>“How do you mean?”<br><br>“How long have you been coming here?”<br><br>“Why I told you all about it this morning. Don’t you remember?”<br><br>Raskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a dream to him. He could<br>not remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin.<br><br>“Hm!” said the latter, “he has forgotten. I fancied then that you were<br>not quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You really<br>look much better. First-rate! Well, to business. Look here, my dear<br>boy.”<br><br>He began untying the bundle, which evidently interested him.<br><br>“Believe me, brother, this is something specially near my heart. For we<br>must make a man of you. Let’s begin from the top. Do you see this<br>cap?” he said, taking out of the bundle a fairly good though cheap and<br>ordinary cap. “Let me try it on.”<br><br>“Presently, afterwards,” said Raskolnikov, waving it off pettishly.<br><br>“Come, Rodya, my boy, don’t oppose it, afterwards will be too late; and<br>I shan’t sleep all night, for I bought it by guess, without measure.<br>Just right!” he cried triumphantly, fitting it on, “just your size! A<br>proper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in<br>its own way. Tolstyakov, a friend of mine, is always obliged to take off<br>his pudding basin when he goes into any public place where other<br>people wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from slavish<br>politeness, but it’s simply because he is ashamed of his bird’s nest;<br>he is such a boastful fellow! Look, Nastasya, here are two specimens of<br>headgear: this Palmerston”--he took from the corner Raskolnikov’s old,<br>battered hat, which for some unknown reason, he called a Palmerston--“or<br>this jewel! Guess the price, Rodya, what do you suppose I paid for it,<br>Nastasya!” he said, turning to her, seeing that Raskolnikov did not<br>speak.<br><br>“Twenty copecks, no more, I dare say,” answered Nastasya.<br><br>“Twenty copecks, silly!” he cried, offended. “Why, nowadays you would<br>cost more than that--eighty copecks! And that only because it has been<br>worn. And it’s bought on condition that when’s it’s worn out, they will<br>give you another next year. Yes, on my word! Well, now let us pass to<br>the United States of America, as they called them at school. I assure<br>you I am proud of these breeches,” and he exhibited to Raskolnikov a<br>pair of light, summer trousers of grey woollen material. “No holes, no<br>spots, and quite respectable, although a little worn; and a waistcoat<br>to match, quite in the fashion. And its being worn really is an<br>improvement, it’s softer, smoother.... You see, Rodya, to my thinking,<br>the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the<br>seasons; if you don’t insist on having asparagus in January, you keep<br>your money in your purse; and it’s the same with this purchase. It’s<br>summer now, so I’ve been buying summer things--warmer materials will be<br>wanted for autumn, so you will have to throw these away in any case...<br>especially as they will be done for by then from their own lack of<br>coherence if not your higher standard of luxury. Come, price them! What<br>do you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And remember the condition:<br>if you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only<br>do business on that system at Fedyaev’s; if you’ve bought a thing once,<br>you are satisfied for life, for you will never go there again of your<br>own free will. Now for the boots. What do you say? You see that they are<br>a bit worn, but they’ll last a couple of months, for it’s foreign work<br>and foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last<br>week--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.<br>Price--a rouble and a half. A bargain?”<br><br>“But perhaps they won’t fit,” observed Nastasya.<br><br>“Not fit? Just look!” and he pulled out of his pocket Raskolnikov’s<br>old, broken boot, stiffly coated with dry mud. “I did not go<br>empty-handed--they took the size from this monster. We all did our best.<br>And as to your linen, your landlady has seen to that. Here, to begin<br>with are three shirts, hempen but with a fashionable front.... Well<br>now then, eighty copecks the cap, two roubles twenty-five copecks the<br>suit--together three roubles five copecks--a rouble and a half for the<br>boots--for, you see, they are very good--and that makes four roubles<br>fifty-five copecks; five roubles for the underclothes--they were<br>bought in the lot--which makes exactly nine roubles fifty-five copecks.<br>Forty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya,<br>you are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will<br>serve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from getting one’s<br>clothes from Sharmer’s! As for your socks and other things, I leave them<br>to you; we’ve twenty-five roubles left. And as for Pashenka and paying<br>for your lodging, don’t you worry. I tell you she’ll trust you for<br>anything. And now, brother, let me change your linen, for I daresay you<br>will throw off your illness with your shirt.”<br><br>“Let me be! I don’t want to!” Raskolnikov waved him off. He had listened<br>with disgust to Razumihin’s efforts to be playful about his purchases.<br><br>“Come, brother, don’t tell me I’ve been trudging around for nothing,”<br> Razumihin insisted. “Nastasya, don’t be bashful, but help me--that’s<br>it,” and in spite of Raskolnikov’s resistance he changed his linen. The<br>latter sank back on the pillows and for a minute or two said nothing.<br><br>“It will be long before I get rid of them,” he thought. “What money was<br>all that bought with?” he asked at last, gazing at the wall.<br><br>“Money? Why, your own, what the messenger brought from Vahrushin, your<br>mother sent it. Have you forgotten that, too?”<br><br>“I remember now,” said Raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence.<br>Razumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.<br><br>The door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar<br>to Raskolnikov came in.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>Zossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face<br>and straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on<br>his fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionable<br>loose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose,<br>fashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his<br>watch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were,<br>nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made<br>efforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every<br>instant. All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever<br>at his work.<br><br>“I’ve been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he’s come to himself,”<br> cried Razumihin.<br><br>“I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?” said Zossimov to<br>Raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the<br>sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.<br><br>“He is still depressed,” Razumihin went on. “We’ve just changed his<br>linen and he almost cried.”<br><br>“That’s very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish<br>it.... His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still aching, eh?”<br><br>“I am well, I am perfectly well!” Raskolnikov declared positively<br>and irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with<br>glittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to<br>the wall. Zossimov watched him intently.<br><br>“Very good.... Going on all right,” he said lazily. “Has he eaten<br>anything?”<br><br>They told him, and asked what he might have.<br><br>“He may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of<br>course, you must not give him; he’d better not have meat either, and...<br>but no need to tell you that!” Razumihin and he looked at each<br>other. “No more medicine or anything. I’ll look at him again to-morrow.<br>Perhaps, to-day even... but never mind...”<br><br>“To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk,” said Razumihin. “We are<br>going to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Cristal.”<br><br>“I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don’t know... a little,<br>maybe... but we’ll see.”<br><br>“Ach, what a nuisance! I’ve got a house-warming party to-night; it’s<br>only a step from here. Couldn’t he come? He could lie on the sofa. You<br>are coming?” Razumihin said to Zossimov. “Don’t forget, you promised.”<br><br>“All right, only rather later. What are you going to do?”<br><br>“Oh, nothing--tea, vodka, herrings. There will be a pie... just our<br>friends.”<br><br>“And who?”<br><br>“All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and<br>he is new too--he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some<br>business of his. We meet once in five years.”<br><br>“What is he?”<br><br>“He’s been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a<br>little pension. He is sixty-five--not worth talking about.... But I<br>am fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation<br>Department here... But you know him.”<br><br>“Is he a relation of yours, too?”<br><br>“A very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarrelled<br>once, won’t you come then?”<br><br>“I don’t care a damn for him.”<br><br>“So much the better. Well, there will be some students, a teacher, a<br>government clerk, a musician, an officer and Zametov.”<br><br>“Do tell me, please, what you or he”--Zossimov nodded at<br>Raskolnikov--“can have in common with this Zametov?”<br><br>“Oh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are worked by principles,<br>as it were by springs; you won’t venture to turn round on your own<br>account. If a man is a nice fellow, that’s the only principle I go upon.<br>Zametov is a delightful person.”<br><br>“Though he does take bribes.”<br><br>“Well, he does! and what of it? I don’t care if he does take bribes,”<br> Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. “I don’t praise him for<br>taking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one<br>looks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left? Why, I am sure<br>I shouldn’t be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrown<br>in.”<br><br>“That’s too little; I’d give two for you.”<br><br>“And I wouldn’t give more than one for you. No more of your jokes!<br>Zametov is no more than a boy. I can pull his hair and one must draw him<br>not repel him. You’ll never improve a man by repelling him, especially<br>a boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh, you progressive<br>dullards! You don’t understand. You harm yourselves running another man<br>down.... But if you want to know, we really have something in common.”<br><br>“I should like to know what.”<br><br>“Why, it’s all about a house-painter.... We are getting him out of<br>a mess! Though indeed there’s nothing to fear now. The matter is<br>absolutely self-evident. We only put on steam.”<br><br>“A painter?”<br><br>“Why, haven’t I told you about it? I only told you the beginning then<br>about the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman. Well, the painter is mixed<br>up in it...”<br><br>“Oh, I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it...<br>partly... for one reason.... I read about it in the papers, too....”<br><br>“Lizaveta was murdered, too,” Nastasya blurted out, suddenly addressing<br>Raskolnikov. She remained in the room all the time, standing by the door<br>listening.<br><br>“Lizaveta,” murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly.<br><br>“Lizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didn’t you know her? She used to come<br>here. She mended a shirt for you, too.”<br><br>Raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he<br>picked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began<br>examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the<br>petals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless<br>as though they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move, but stared<br>obstinately at the flower.<br><br>“But what about the painter?” Zossimov interrupted Nastasya’s chatter<br>with marked displeasure. She sighed and was silent.<br><br>“Why, he was accused of the murder,” Razumihin went on hotly.<br><br>“Was there evidence against him then?”<br><br>“Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and that’s what we<br>have to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and<br>Pestryakov, at first. Foo! how stupidly it’s all done, it makes one<br>sick, though it’s not one’s business! Pestryakov may be coming<br>to-night.... By the way, Rodya, you’ve heard about the business already;<br>it happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the<br>police office while they were talking about it.”<br><br>Zossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not stir.<br><br>“But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you. What a busybody you are!”<br> Zossimov observed.<br><br>“Maybe I am, but we will get him off anyway,” shouted Razumihin,<br>bringing his fist down on the table. “What’s the most offensive is not<br>their lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing,<br>for it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship<br>their own lying.... I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out at<br>first? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter<br>it was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the<br>murderers--that was their logic!”<br><br>“But don’t excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not<br>help that.... And, by the way, I’ve met that man Koch. He used to buy<br>unredeemed pledges from the old woman? Eh?”<br><br>“Yes, he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts, too. He makes a profession<br>of it. But enough of him! Do you know what makes me angry? It’s their<br>sickening rotten, petrified routine.... And this case might be the means<br>of introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data<br>alone how to get on the track of the real man. ‘We have facts,’ they<br>say. But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in<br>how you interpret them!”<br><br>“Can you interpret them, then?”<br><br>“Anyway, one can’t hold one’s tongue when one has a feeling, a tangible<br>feeling, that one might be a help if only.... Eh! Do you know the<br>details of the case?”<br><br>“I am waiting to hear about the painter.”<br><br>“Oh, yes! Well, here’s the story. Early on the third day after the<br>murder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they<br>accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an<br>unexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a<br>dram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller’s<br>case containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. ‘The<br>day before yesterday, just after eight o’clock’--mark the day and the<br>hour!--‘a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me<br>already that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and<br>asked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got<br>them, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him<br>anything more.’ I am telling you Dushkin’s story. ‘I gave him a note’--a<br>rouble that is--‘for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would<br>with another. It would all come to the same thing--he’d spend it on<br>drink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it<br>the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any<br>rumours, I’ll take it to the police.’ Of course, that’s all taradiddle;<br>he lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and<br>a receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a<br>thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simply<br>afraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkin’s story. ‘I’ve known<br>this peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same<br>province and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan men. And though<br>Nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that<br>house, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.<br>As soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses,<br>took his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then.<br>And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and<br>her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I felt<br>suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman<br>lent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make careful<br>inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, “Is<br>Nikolay here?” Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he<br>had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes,<br>and went out again. Dmitri didn’t see him again and is finishing the<br>job alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on<br>the second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word to<br>anyone’--that’s Dushkin’s tale--‘but I found out what I could about<br>the murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight<br>o’clock this morning’--that was the third day, you understand--‘I saw<br>Nikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could<br>understand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did not<br>speak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep<br>on a bench and our two boys. “Have you seen Dmitri?” said I. “No, I<br>haven’t,” said he. “And you’ve not been here either?” “Not since the day<br>before yesterday,” said he. “And where did you sleep last night?”<br> “In Peski, with the Kolomensky men.” “And where did you get those<br>ear-rings?” I asked. “I found them in the street,” and the way he said<br>it was a bit queer; he did not look at me. “Did you hear what happened<br>that very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?” said I.<br>“No,” said he, “I had not heard,” and all the while he was listening,<br>his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I<br>told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted<br>to keep him. “Wait a bit, Nikolay,” said I, “won’t you have a drink?”<br> And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the<br>bar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.<br>I have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his<br>doing, as clear as could be....’”<br><br>“I should think so,” said Zossimov.<br><br>“Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay;<br>they detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested;<br>the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before<br>yesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He<br>had gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram<br>for it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went<br>to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable<br>adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a<br>block of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman<br>screeched her hardest; people ran in. ‘So that’s what you are up to!’<br>‘Take me,’ he says, ‘to such-and-such a police officer; I’ll confess<br>everything.’ Well, they took him to that police station--that is<br>here--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how old<br>he is, ‘twenty-two,’ and so on. At the question, ‘When you were working<br>with Dmitri, didn’t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a<br>time?’--answer: ‘To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did<br>not notice them.’ ‘And didn’t you hear anything, any noise, and so on?’<br>‘We heard nothing special.’ ‘And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same<br>day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?’ ‘I<br>never knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy<br>Pavlovitch the day before yesterday.’ ‘And where did you find the<br>ear-rings?’ ‘I found them on the pavement.’ ‘Why didn’t you go to work<br>with Dmitri the other day?’ ‘Because I was drinking.’ ‘And where were<br>you drinking?’ ‘Oh, in such-and-such a place.’ ‘Why did you run away<br>from Dushkin’s?’ ‘Because I was awfully frightened.’ ‘What were<br>you frightened of?’ ‘That I should be accused.’ ‘How could you be<br>frightened, if you felt free from guilt?’ Now, Zossimov, you may not<br>believe me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it<br>for a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?”<br><br>“Well, anyway, there’s the evidence.”<br><br>“I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question,<br>of their own idea of themselves. Well, so they squeezed and squeezed<br>him and he confessed: ‘I did not find it in the street, but in the flat<br>where I was painting with Dmitri.’ ‘And how was that?’ ‘Why, Dmitri and<br>I were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and<br>Dmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him.<br>I ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I<br>ran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen<br>were there I don’t remember. And the porter swore at me, and the other<br>porter swore, too, and the porter’s wife came out, and swore at us, too;<br>and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us,<br>too, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitri’s<br>hair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught<br>me by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper<br>but in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran into<br>the street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back<br>to the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting them<br>together, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the<br>corner by the door, I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped<br>up in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them,<br>and in the box were the ear-rings....’”<br><br>“Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door?” Raskolnikov<br>cried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he<br>slowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand.<br><br>“Yes... why? What’s the matter? What’s wrong?” Razumihin, too, got up<br>from his seat.<br><br>“Nothing,” Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All were<br>silent for a while.<br><br>“He must have waked from a dream,” Razumihin said at last, looking<br>inquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.<br><br>“Well, go on,” said Zossimov. “What next?”<br><br>“What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and<br>everything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got<br>a rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and<br>went off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:<br>‘I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.’<br>‘And why didn’t you come to the police till now?’ ‘I was frightened.’<br>‘And why did you try to hang yourself?’ ‘From anxiety.’ ‘What anxiety?’<br>‘That I should be accused of it.’ Well, that’s the whole story. And now<br>what do you suppose they deduced from that?”<br><br>“Why, there’s no supposing. There’s a clue, such as it is, a fact. You<br>wouldn’t have your painter set free?”<br><br>“Now they’ve simply taken him for the murderer. They haven’t a shadow of<br>doubt.”<br><br>“That’s nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? You<br>must admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old<br>woman’s box have come into Nikolay’s hands, they must have come there<br>somehow. That’s a good deal in such a case.”<br><br>“How did they get there? How did they get there?” cried Razumihin.<br>“How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more<br>opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail<br>to see the character of the man in the whole story? Don’t you see at<br>once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy<br>truth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped<br>on the box and picked it up.”<br><br>“The holy truth! But didn’t he own himself that he told a lie at first?”<br><br>“Listen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and Pestryakov<br>and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who<br>was sitting in the porter’s lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got<br>out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his<br>arm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on<br>the ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his<br>hair, beating him, too. They lay right across the way, blocking the<br>thoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they ‘like children’<br>(the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another,<br>squealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing<br>one another like children, they ran into the street. Now take careful<br>note. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they<br>found them! If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open<br>the boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one<br>question: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish<br>scuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning,<br>robbery? They’d just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for<br>the bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing<br>that people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they<br>rolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.<br>And there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!”<br><br>“Of course it is strange! It’s impossible, indeed, but...”<br><br>“No, brother, no _buts_. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay’s<br>hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important<br>piece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation<br>given by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously<br>against him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him<br>innocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_. And<br>do you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will<br>accept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting<br>simply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively<br>breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, they<br>won’t accept it, they certainly won’t, because they found the jewel-case<br>and the man tried to hang himself, ‘which he could not have done if he<br>hadn’t felt guilty.’ That’s the point, that’s what excites me, you must<br>understand!”<br><br>“Oh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proof<br>is there that the box came from the old woman?”<br><br>“That’s been proved,” said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning.<br>“Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who<br>proved conclusively that it was his.”<br><br>“That’s bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the time<br>that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no<br>evidence about that?”<br><br>“Nobody did see him,” Razumihin answered with vexation. “That’s the<br>worst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way<br>upstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.<br>They said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going<br>on in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether<br>there actually were men at work in it.”<br><br>“Hm!... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating<br>one another and laughing. That constitutes a strong presumption, but...<br>How do you explain the facts yourself?”<br><br>“How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It’s clear. At any<br>rate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and<br>the jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.<br>The murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked<br>at the door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the<br>murderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of<br>escape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when<br>Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while the<br>porter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of<br>hearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri<br>and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;<br>possibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people going<br>in and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when<br>he stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he<br>had other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that<br>he did stand there.... That’s how I explain it.”<br><br>“Too clever! No, my boy, you’re too clever. That beats everything.”<br><br>“But, why, why?”<br><br>“Why, because everything fits too well... it’s too melodramatic.”<br><br>“A-ach!” Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened<br>and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>This was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance,<br>and a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the<br>doorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment,<br>as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.<br>Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost<br>affronted, he scanned Raskolnikov’s low and narrow “cabin.” With the<br>same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled,<br>unwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with<br>the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and<br>unshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the<br>face without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for a<br>couple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting<br>took place. Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,<br>that he would get nothing in this “cabin” by attempting to overawe them,<br>the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity,<br>emphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov:<br><br>“Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?”<br><br>Zossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not<br>Razumihin anticipated him.<br><br>“Here he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?”<br><br>This familiar “what do you want” seemed to cut the ground from the<br>feet of the pompous gentleman. He was turning to Razumihin, but checked<br>himself in time and turned to Zossimov again.<br><br>“This is Raskolnikov,” mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him. Then he<br>gave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then he<br>lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold<br>watch in a round hunter’s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly<br>and lazily proceeded to put it back.<br><br>Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing<br>persistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. Now that<br>his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it<br>was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just<br>undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. But<br>the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder,<br>then suspicion and even alarm. When Zossimov said “This is Raskolnikov”<br> he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but<br>weak and breaking, voice articulated:<br><br>“Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?”<br><br>The visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:<br><br>“Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name<br>is not wholly unknown to you?”<br><br>But Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed<br>blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the<br>name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time.<br><br>“Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no<br>information?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.<br><br>In reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands<br>behind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into<br>Luzhin’s face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively<br>than ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.<br><br>“I had presumed and calculated,” he faltered, “that a letter posted more<br>than ten days, if not a fortnight ago...”<br><br>“I say, why are you standing in the doorway?” Razumihin interrupted<br>suddenly. “If you’ve something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are so<br>crowded. Nastasya, make room. Here’s a chair, thread your way in!”<br><br>He moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the<br>table and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the<br>visitor to “thread his way in.” The minute was so chosen that it was<br>impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying<br>and stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at<br>Razumihin.<br><br>“No need to be nervous,” the latter blurted out. “Rodya has been ill for<br>the last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and<br>has got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.<br>I am a comrade of Rodya’s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am<br>nursing him; so don’t you take any notice of us, but go on with your<br>business.”<br><br>“Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and<br>conversation?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov.<br><br>“N-no,” mumbled Zossimov; “you may amuse him.” He yawned again.<br><br>“He has been conscious a long time, since the morning,” went on<br>Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature<br>that Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps,<br>because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a<br>student.<br><br>“Your mamma,” began Luzhin.<br><br>“Hm!” Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin looked at him<br>inquiringly.<br><br>“That’s all right, go on.”<br><br>Luzhin shrugged his shoulders.<br><br>“Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in<br>her neighbourhood. On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to<br>elapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully<br>assured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my<br>astonishment...”<br><br>“I know, I know!” Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation.<br>“So you are the _fiancé_? I know, and that’s enough!”<br><br>There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch’s being offended this time,<br>but he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all<br>meant. There was a moment’s silence.<br><br>Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he<br>answered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as<br>though he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something<br>new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at<br>him. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole<br>appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of “fiancé” so<br>unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far<br>too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few<br>days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation<br>of his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,<br>indeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the<br>agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such<br>circumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of<br>fiancé. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor’s and were all<br>right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even<br>the stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch<br>treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The<br>exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,<br>if only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in<br>his hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr<br>Petrovitch’s attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,<br>light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a<br>cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best<br>of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even<br>handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.<br>His dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,<br>growing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,<br>touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled<br>at a hairdresser’s, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair<br>usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.<br>If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather<br>good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other<br>causes. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled<br>malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as<br>before.<br><br>But Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no<br>notice of their oddities.<br><br>“I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,” he began,<br>again breaking the silence with an effort. “If I had been aware of your<br>illness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I<br>have, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention<br>other preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your<br>mamma and sister any minute.”<br><br>Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed<br>some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing<br>followed, he went on:<br><br>“... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival.”<br><br>“Where?” asked Raskolnikov weakly.<br><br>“Very near here, in Bakaleyev’s house.”<br><br>“That’s in Voskresensky,” put in Razumihin. “There are two storeys of<br>rooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I’ve been there.”<br><br>“Yes, rooms...”<br><br>“A disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what’s more, of doubtful<br>character. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer<br>people living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. It’s<br>cheap, though...”<br><br>“I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger<br>in Petersburg myself,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. “However, the<br>two rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...<br>I have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat,” he said,<br>addressing Raskolnikov, “and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am<br>myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch<br>Lebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me<br>of Bakaleyev’s house, too...”<br><br>“Lebeziatnikov?” said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something.<br><br>“Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you<br>know him?”<br><br>“Yes... no,” Raskolnikov answered.<br><br>“Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian....<br>A very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one<br>learns new things from them.” Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all.<br><br>“How do you mean?” asked Razumihin.<br><br>“In the most serious and essential matters,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied,<br>as though delighted at the question. “You see, it’s ten years since I<br>visited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in<br>the provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.<br>And it’s my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the<br>younger generation. And I confess I am delighted...”<br><br>“At what?”<br><br>“Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find<br>clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...”<br><br>“That’s true,” Zossimov let drop.<br><br>“Nonsense! There’s no practicality.” Razumihin flew at him.<br>“Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from<br>heaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from<br>all practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,” he said to<br>Pyotr Petrovitch, “and desire for good exists, though it’s in a childish<br>form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.<br>Anyway, there’s no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.”<br><br>“I don’t agree with you,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident<br>enjoyment. “Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,<br>but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of<br>enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little<br>has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.<br>It’s my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been<br>accomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are<br>circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.<br>Literature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been<br>rooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselves<br>off irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great<br>thing...”<br><br>“He’s learnt it by heart to show off!” Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.<br><br>“What?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received<br>no reply.<br><br>“That’s all true,” Zossimov hastened to interpose.<br><br>“Isn’t it so?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov.<br>“You must admit,” he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of<br>triumph and superciliousness--he almost added “young man”--“that there<br>is an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and<br>economic truth...”<br><br>“A commonplace.”<br><br>“No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, ‘love<br>thy neighbour,’ what came of it?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with<br>excessive haste. “It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my<br>neighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has<br>it, ‘Catch several hares and you won’t catch one.’ Science now tells<br>us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on<br>self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly<br>and your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private<br>affairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the<br>firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare<br>organised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for<br>myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to<br>pass my neighbour’s getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not<br>from private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general<br>advance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time<br>reaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it<br>would seem to want very little wit to perceive it...”<br><br>“Excuse me, I’ve very little wit myself,” Razumihin cut in sharply,<br>“and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object, but I’ve<br>grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse<br>oneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that,<br>by Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a<br>hurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don’t blame you,<br>that’s quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man you<br>are, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive<br>cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything<br>they touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire. That’s<br>enough!”<br><br>“Excuse me, sir,” said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive<br>dignity. “Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too...”<br><br>“Oh, my dear sir... how could I?... Come, that’s enough,” Razumihin<br>concluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous<br>conversation.<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. He made up<br>his mind to take leave in another minute or two.<br><br>“I trust our acquaintance,” he said, addressing Raskolnikov, “may, upon<br>your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware,<br>become closer... Above all, I hope for your return to health...”<br><br>Raskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petrovitch began getting<br>up from his chair.<br><br>“One of her customers must have killed her,” Zossimov declared<br>positively.<br><br>“Not a doubt of it,” replied Razumihin. “Porfiry doesn’t give his<br>opinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her there.”<br><br>“Examining them?” Raskolnikov asked aloud.<br><br>“Yes. What then?”<br><br>“Nothing.”<br><br>“How does he get hold of them?” asked Zossimov.<br><br>“Koch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the<br>wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves.”<br><br>“It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The boldness of it!<br>The coolness!”<br><br>“That’s just what it wasn’t!” interposed Razumihin. “That’s what throws<br>you all off the scent. But I maintain that he is not cunning, not<br>practised, and probably this was his first crime! The supposition that<br>it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn’t work. Suppose<br>him to have been inexperienced, and it’s clear that it was only a chance<br>that saved him--and chance may do anything. Why, he did not foresee<br>obstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He took jewels worth<br>ten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the<br>old woman’s trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles,<br>besides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know<br>how to rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime, I assure you,<br>his first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by luck than good<br>counsel!”<br><br>“You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe?” Pyotr<br>Petrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He was standing, hat and gloves<br>in hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more<br>intellectual phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a favourable<br>impression and his vanity overcame his prudence.<br><br>“Yes. You’ve heard of it?”<br><br>“Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood.”<br><br>“Do you know the details?”<br><br>“I can’t say that; but another circumstance interests me in the<br>case--the whole question, so to say. Not to speak of the fact that crime<br>has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last<br>five years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere,<br>what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes,<br>too, crime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears of a<br>student’s robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of<br>good social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole<br>gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of<br>the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary<br>abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain.... And if this old<br>woman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class<br>in society--for peasants don’t pawn gold trinkets--how are we to explain<br>this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?”<br><br>“There are many economic changes,” put in Zossimov.<br><br>“How are we to explain it?” Razumihin caught him up. “It might be<br>explained by our inveterate impracticality.”<br><br>“How do you mean?”<br><br>“What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he<br>was forging notes? ‘Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I<br>want to make haste to get rich too.’ I don’t remember the exact words,<br>but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or<br>working! We’ve grown used to having everything ready-made, to walking<br>on crutches, to having our food chewed for us. Then the great hour<br>struck,[*] and every man showed himself in his true colours.”<br><br>     [*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant.<br>     --TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.<br><br>“But morality? And so to speak, principles...”<br><br>“But why do you worry about it?” Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. “It’s<br>in accordance with your theory!”<br><br>“In accordance with my theory?”<br><br>“Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and<br>it follows that people may be killed...”<br><br>“Upon my word!” cried Luzhin.<br><br>“No, that’s not so,” put in Zossimov.<br><br>Raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing<br>painfully.<br><br>“There’s a measure in all things,” Luzhin went on superciliously.<br>“Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to<br>suppose...”<br><br>“And is it true,” Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a<br>voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, “is it true that<br>you told your _fiancée_... within an hour of her acceptance, that what<br>pleased you most... was that she was a beggar... because it was better<br>to raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over<br>her, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?”<br><br>“Upon my word,” Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with<br>confusion, “to distort my words in this way! Excuse me, allow me to<br>assure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say,<br>has been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I... suspect<br>who... in a word... this arrow... in a word, your mamma... She seemed<br>to me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, of a somewhat<br>high-flown and romantic way of thinking.... But I was a thousand miles<br>from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in<br>so fanciful a way.... And indeed... indeed...”<br><br>“I tell you what,” cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and<br>fixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, “I tell you what.”<br><br>“What?” Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face.<br>Silence lasted for some seconds.<br><br>“Why, if ever again... you dare to mention a single word... about my<br>mother... I shall send you flying downstairs!”<br><br>“What’s the matter with you?” cried Razumihin.<br><br>“So that’s how it is?” Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. “Let me tell<br>you, sir,” he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself<br>but breathing hard, “at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed<br>to me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more. I could forgive<br>a great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you... never after<br>this...”<br><br>“I am not ill,” cried Raskolnikov.<br><br>“So much the worse...”<br><br>“Go to hell!”<br><br>But Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing<br>between the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him<br>pass. Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who<br>had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone,<br>he went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid<br>crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. And even the curve of<br>his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.<br><br>“How could you--how could you!” Razumihin said, shaking his head in<br>perplexity.<br><br>“Let me alone--let me alone all of you!” Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy.<br>“Will you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you! I am<br>not afraid of anyone, anyone now! Get away from me! I want to be alone,<br>alone, alone!”<br><br>“Come along,” said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin.<br><br>“But we can’t leave him like this!”<br><br>“Come along,” Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out. Razumihin<br>thought a minute and ran to overtake him.<br><br>“It might be worse not to obey him,” said Zossimov on the stairs. “He<br>mustn’t be irritated.”<br><br>“What’s the matter with him?”<br><br>“If only he could get some favourable shock, that’s what would do it! At<br>first he was better.... You know he has got something on his mind! Some<br>fixed idea weighing on him.... I am very much afraid so; he must have!”<br><br>“Perhaps it’s that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch. From his conversation<br>I gather he is going to marry his sister, and that he had received a<br>letter about it just before his illness....”<br><br>“Yes, confound the man! he may have upset the case altogether. But have<br>you noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond to<br>anything except one point on which he seems excited--that’s the murder?”<br><br>“Yes, yes,” Razumihin agreed, “I noticed that, too. He is interested,<br>frightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police<br>office; he fainted.”<br><br>“Tell me more about that this evening and I’ll tell you something<br>afterwards. He interests me very much! In half an hour I’ll go and see<br>him again.... There’ll be no inflammation though.”<br><br>“Thanks! And I’ll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him<br>through Nastasya....”<br><br>Raskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya,<br>but she still lingered.<br><br>“Won’t you have some tea now?” she asked.<br><br>“Later! I am sleepy! Leave me.”<br><br>He turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>But as soon as she went out, he got up, latched the door, undid the<br>parcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again<br>and began dressing. Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become<br>perfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic<br>fear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strange<br>sudden calm. His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was<br>evident in them. “To-day, to-day,” he muttered to himself. He understood<br>that he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him<br>strength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he would not<br>fall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he<br>looked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment’s thought<br>put it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He took also all the<br>copper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.<br>Then he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and<br>glanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her back<br>to him, blowing up the landlady’s samovar. She heard nothing. Who would<br>have dreamed of his going out, indeed? A minute later he was in the<br>street.<br><br>It was nearly eight o’clock, the sun was setting. It was as stifling as<br>before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air. His head<br>felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his<br>feverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face. He did not know and<br>did not think where he was going, he had one thought only: “that all<br>_this_ must be ended to-day, once for all, immediately; that he would<br>not return home without it, because he _would not go on living like<br>that_.” How, with what to make an end? He had not an idea about it,<br>he did not even want to think of it. He drove away thought; thought<br>tortured him. All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be<br>changed “one way or another,” he repeated with desperate and immovable<br>self-confidence and determination.<br><br>From old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay<br>Market. A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in<br>the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very<br>sentimental song. He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood<br>on the pavement in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a<br>mantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very<br>old and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and<br>coarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from<br>the shop. Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five<br>copeck piece and put it in the girl’s hand. She broke off abruptly on a<br>sentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder “Come on,”<br> and both moved on to the next shop.<br><br>“Do you like street music?” said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged<br>man standing idly by him. The man looked at him, startled and wondering.<br><br>“I love to hear singing to a street organ,” said Raskolnikov, and his<br>manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--“I like it<br>on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the<br>passers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet<br>snow is falling straight down, when there’s no wind--you know what I<br>mean?--and the street lamps shine through it...”<br><br>“I don’t know.... Excuse me...” muttered the stranger, frightened by the<br>question and Raskolnikov’s strange manner, and he crossed over to the<br>other side of the street.<br><br>Raskolnikov walked straight on and came out at the corner of the Hay<br>Market, where the huckster and his wife had talked with Lizaveta; but<br>they were not there now. Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round<br>and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a<br>corn chandler’s shop.<br><br>“Isn’t there a man who keeps a booth with his wife at this corner?”<br><br>“All sorts of people keep booths here,” answered the young man, glancing<br>superciliously at Raskolnikov.<br><br>“What’s his name?”<br><br>“What he was christened.”<br><br>“Aren’t you a Zaraïsky man, too? Which province?”<br><br>The young man looked at Raskolnikov again.<br><br>“It’s not a province, your excellency, but a district. Graciously<br>forgive me, your excellency!”<br><br>“Is that a tavern at the top there?”<br><br>“Yes, it’s an eating-house and there’s a billiard-room and you’ll find<br>princesses there too.... La-la!”<br><br>Raskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowd<br>of peasants. He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking<br>at the faces. He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into<br>conversation with people. But the peasants took no notice of him; they<br>were all shouting in groups together. He stood and thought a little and<br>took a turning to the right in the direction of V.<br><br>He had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading<br>from the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of late he had often felt drawn<br>to wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might<br>feel more so.<br><br>Now he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point there is a great<br>block of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;<br>women were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their<br>indoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement,<br>especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in<br>the lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the<br>tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.<br>A crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the<br>steps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunken<br>soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road,<br>swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had<br>forgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead<br>drunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of<br>women, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore<br>cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some<br>not more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.<br><br>He felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and<br>uproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing<br>frantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar<br>and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently,<br>gloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping<br>inquisitively in from the pavement.<br><br>  “Oh, my handsome soldier<br>   Don’t beat me for nothing,”<br><br>trilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a great desire to<br>make out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that.<br><br>“Shall I go in?” he thought. “They are laughing. From drink. Shall I get<br>drunk?”<br><br>“Won’t you come in?” one of the women asked him. Her voice was<br>still musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not<br>repulsive--the only one of the group.<br><br>“Why, she’s pretty,” he said, drawing himself up and looking at her.<br><br>She smiled, much pleased at the compliment.<br><br>“You’re very nice looking yourself,” she said.<br><br>“Isn’t he thin though!” observed another woman in a deep bass. “Have you<br>just come out of a hospital?”<br><br>“They’re all generals’ daughters, it seems, but they have all snub<br>noses,” interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing<br>a loose coat. “See how jolly they are.”<br><br>“Go along with you!”<br><br>“I’ll go, sweetie!”<br><br>And he darted down into the saloon below. Raskolnikov moved on.<br><br>“I say, sir,” the girl shouted after him.<br><br>“What is it?”<br><br>She hesitated.<br><br>“I’ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but<br>now I feel shy. Give me six copecks for a drink, there’s a nice young<br>man!”<br><br>Raskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.<br><br>“Ah, what a good-natured gentleman!”<br><br>“What’s your name?”<br><br>“Ask for Duclida.”<br><br>“Well, that’s too much,” one of the women observed, shaking her head<br>at Duclida. “I don’t know how you can ask like that. I believe I should<br>drop with shame....”<br><br>Raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a pock-marked wench<br>of thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen. She made<br>her criticism quietly and earnestly. “Where is it,” thought Raskolnikov.<br>“Where is it I’ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks,<br>an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock,<br>on such a narrow ledge that he’d only room to stand, and the ocean,<br>everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around<br>him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his<br>life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die<br>at once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!...<br>How true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile<br>is he who calls him vile for that,” he added a moment later.<br><br>He went into another street. “Bah, the Palais de Cristal! Razumihin<br>was just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was it<br>I wanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said he’d read it in the<br>papers. Have you the papers?” he asked, going into a very spacious and<br>positively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were,<br>however, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a<br>room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikov<br>fancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that<br>distance. “What if it is?” he thought.<br><br>“Will you have vodka?” asked the waiter.<br><br>“Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last<br>five days, and I’ll give you something.”<br><br>“Yes, sir, here’s to-day’s. No vodka?”<br><br>The old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down and<br>began to look through them.<br><br>“Oh, damn... these are the items of intelligence. An accident on a<br>staircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire<br>in Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the<br>Petersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....<br>Ah, here it is!” He found at last what he was seeking and began to<br>read it. The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began<br>eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. His hands<br>shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets. Suddenly someone<br>sat down beside him at his table. He looked up, it was the head clerk<br>Zametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the<br>watch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the<br>smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a good<br>humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His dark<br>face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.<br><br>“What, you here?” he began in surprise, speaking as though he’d known<br>him all his life. “Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were<br>unconscious. How strange! And do you know I’ve been to see you?”<br><br>Raskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid aside the papers and<br>turned to Zametov. There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of<br>irritable impatience was apparent in that smile.<br><br>“I know you have,” he answered. “I’ve heard it. You looked for my<br>sock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you? He says<br>you’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna’s--you know, the woman you tried<br>to befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he<br>would not understand. Do you remember? How could he fail to<br>understand--it was quite clear, wasn’t it?”<br><br>“What a hot head he is!”<br><br>“The explosive one?”<br><br>“No, your friend Razumihin.”<br><br>“You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most<br>agreeable places. Who’s been pouring champagne into you just now?”<br><br>“We’ve just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouring<br>it into me!”<br><br>“By way of a fee! You profit by everything!” Raskolnikov laughed, “it’s<br>all right, my dear boy,” he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. “I<br>am not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that<br>workman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of<br>the old woman....”<br><br>“How do you know about it?”<br><br>“Perhaps I know more about it than you do.”<br><br>“How strange you are.... I am sure you are still very unwell. You<br>oughtn’t to have come out.”<br><br>“Oh, do I seem strange to you?”<br><br>“Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“There’s a lot about the fires.”<br><br>“No, I am not reading about the fires.” Here he looked mysteriously at<br>Zametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. “No, I am not<br>reading about the fires,” he went on, winking at Zametov. “But confess<br>now, my dear fellow, you’re awfully anxious to know what I am reading<br>about?”<br><br>“I am not in the least. Mayn’t I ask a question? Why do you keep<br>on...?”<br><br>“Listen, you are a man of culture and education?”<br><br>“I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,” said Zametov with some<br>dignity.<br><br>“Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings--you<br>are a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what a charming boy!” Here Raskolnikov<br>broke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov’s face. The latter drew<br>back, more amazed than offended.<br><br>“Foo! how strange you are!” Zametov repeated very seriously. “I can’t<br>help thinking you are still delirious.”<br><br>“I am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? You<br>find me curious, do you?”<br><br>“Yes, curious.”<br><br>“Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for? See<br>what a lot of papers I’ve made them bring me. Suspicious, eh?”<br><br>“Well, what is it?”<br><br>“You prick up your ears?”<br><br>“How do you mean--‘prick up my ears’?”<br><br>“I’ll explain that afterwards, but now, my boy, I declare to you... no,<br>better ‘I confess’... No, that’s not right either; ‘I make a deposition<br>and you take it.’ I depose that I was reading, that I was looking and<br>searching....” he screwed up his eyes and paused. “I was searching--and<br>came here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old<br>pawnbroker woman,” he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing<br>his face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov looked at him<br>steadily, without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametov<br>afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for<br>exactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.<br><br>“What if you have been reading about it?” he cried at last, perplexed<br>and impatient. “That’s no business of mine! What of it?”<br><br>“The same old woman,” Raskolnikov went on in the same whisper, not<br>heeding Zametov’s explanation, “about whom you were talking in the<br>police-office, you remember, when I fainted. Well, do you understand<br>now?”<br><br>“What do you mean? Understand... what?” Zametov brought out, almost<br>alarmed.<br><br>Raskolnikov’s set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he<br>suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though<br>utterly unable to restrain himself. And in one flash he recalled with<br>extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that<br>moment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch<br>trembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden<br>desire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at<br>them, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!<br><br>“You are either mad, or...” began Zametov, and he broke off, as though<br>stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.<br><br>“Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!”<br><br>“Nothing,” said Zametov, getting angry, “it’s all nonsense!”<br><br>Both were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became<br>suddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put his elbow on the table and<br>leaned his head on his hand. He seemed to have completely forgotten<br>Zametov. The silence lasted for some time.<br><br>“Why don’t you drink your tea? It’s getting cold,” said Zametov.<br><br>“What! Tea? Oh, yes....” Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of<br>bread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember<br>everything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his face<br>resumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.<br><br>“There have been a great many of these crimes lately,” said Zametov.<br>“Only the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of<br>false coiners had been caught in Moscow. It was a regular society. They<br>used to forge tickets!”<br><br>“Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month ago,”<br> Raskolnikov answered calmly. “So you consider them criminals?” he added,<br>smiling.<br><br>“Of course they are criminals.”<br><br>“They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundred<br>people meeting for such an object--what an idea! Three would be too<br>many, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in<br>themselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.<br>Simpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what<br>a thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that these<br>simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the<br>rest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his<br>life! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to change<br>the notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand<br>roubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four thousand,<br>but did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the<br>money into his pocket and run away. Of course he roused suspicion. And<br>the whole thing came to a crash through one fool! Is it possible?”<br><br>“That his hands trembled?” observed Zametov, “yes, that’s quite<br>possible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes one can’t<br>stand things.”<br><br>“Can’t stand that?”<br><br>“Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn’t. For the sake of a hundred<br>roubles to face such a terrible experience? To go with false notes<br>into a bank where it’s their business to spot that sort of thing! No, I<br>should not have the face to do it. Would you?”<br><br>Raskolnikov had an intense desire again “to put his tongue out.” Shivers<br>kept running down his spine.<br><br>“I should do it quite differently,” Raskolnikov began. “This is how I<br>would change the notes: I’d count the first thousand three or four times<br>backwards and forwards, looking at every note and then I’d set to the<br>second thousand; I’d count that half-way through and then hold some<br>fifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light<br>again--to see whether it was a good one. ‘I am afraid,’ I would say, ‘a<br>relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a<br>false note,’ and then I’d tell them the whole story. And after I began<br>counting the third, ‘No, excuse me,’ I would say, ‘I fancy I made a<br>mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.’<br>And so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and<br>so on to the end. And when I had finished, I’d pick out one from the<br>fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light<br>and ask again, ‘Change them, please,’ and put the clerk into such a stew<br>that he would not know how to get rid of me. When I’d finished and had<br>gone out, I’d come back, ‘No, excuse me,’ and ask for some explanation.<br>That’s how I’d do it.”<br><br>“Foo! what terrible things you say!” said Zametov, laughing. “But all<br>that is only talk. I dare say when it came to deeds you’d make a slip.<br>I believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on<br>himself, much less you and I. To take an example near home--that old<br>woman murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been a<br>desperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by<br>a miracle--but his hands shook, too. He did not succeed in robbing the<br>place, he couldn’t stand it. That was clear from the...”<br><br>Raskolnikov seemed offended.<br><br>“Clear? Why don’t you catch him then?” he cried, maliciously gibing at<br>Zametov.<br><br>“Well, they will catch him.”<br><br>“Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? You’ve a tough job! A<br>great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not. If he had<br>no money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man. So that any<br>child can mislead you.”<br><br>“The fact is they always do that, though,” answered Zametov. “A man will<br>commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes<br>drinking in a tavern. They are caught spending money, they are not all<br>as cunning as you are. You wouldn’t go to a tavern, of course?”<br><br>Raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.<br><br>“You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should<br>behave in that case, too?” he asked with displeasure.<br><br>“I should like to,” Zametov answered firmly and seriously. Somewhat too<br>much earnestness began to appear in his words and looks.<br><br>“Very much?”<br><br>“Very much!”<br><br>“All right then. This is how I should behave,” Raskolnikov began, again<br>bringing his face close to Zametov’s, again staring at him and speaking<br>in a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. “This is what<br>I should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels, I should<br>have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place<br>with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden<br>or place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stone<br>weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from<br>the time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sure<br>to be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that<br>hole. Then I’d roll the stone back so that it would look as before,<br>would press it down with my foot and walk away. And for a year or two,<br>three maybe, I would not touch it. And, well, they could search! There’d<br>be no trace.”<br><br>“You are a madman,” said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a<br>whisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering. He<br>had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.<br>He bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to move<br>without uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he<br>was doing, but could not restrain himself. The terrible word trembled on<br>his lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break<br>out, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out.<br><br>“And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?” he said<br>suddenly and--realised what he had done.<br><br>Zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth. His<br>face wore a contorted smile.<br><br>“But is it possible?” he brought out faintly. Raskolnikov looked<br>wrathfully at him.<br><br>“Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?”<br><br>“Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now,” Zametov cried<br>hastily.<br><br>“I’ve caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before, if now you<br>believe less than ever?”<br><br>“Not at all,” cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed. “Have you been<br>frightening me so as to lead up to this?”<br><br>“You don’t believe it then? What were you talking about behind my<br>back when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosive<br>lieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey, there,” he shouted to the<br>waiter, getting up and taking his cap, “how much?”<br><br>“Thirty copecks,” the latter replied, running up.<br><br>“And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money!” he<br>held out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. “Red notes and<br>blue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my new<br>clothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. You’ve cross-examined my<br>landlady, I’ll be bound.... Well, that’s enough! _Assez causé!_ Till we<br>meet again!”<br><br>He went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical<br>sensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture. Yet he<br>was gloomy and terribly tired. His face was twisted as after a fit.<br>His fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock, any irritating sensation<br>stimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as<br>quickly when the stimulus was removed.<br><br>Zametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in<br>thought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on<br>a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.<br><br>“Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead,” he decided.<br><br>Raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he<br>stumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each other<br>till they almost knocked against each other. For a moment they stood<br>looking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then<br>anger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.<br><br>“So here you are!” he shouted at the top of his voice--“you ran away<br>from your bed! And here I’ve been looking for you under the sofa! We<br>went up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And here<br>he is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it? Tell me the whole<br>truth! Confess! Do you hear?”<br><br>“It means that I’m sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,”<br> Raskolnikov answered calmly.<br><br>“Alone? When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a<br>sheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot!... What have you been doing<br>in the Palais de Cristal? Own up at once!”<br><br>“Let me go!” said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This was too much<br>for Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.<br><br>“Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know what I’ll do<br>with you directly? I’ll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you<br>home under my arm and lock you up!”<br><br>“Listen, Razumihin,” Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--“can’t<br>you see that I don’t want your benevolence? A strange desire you have to<br>shower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in<br>fact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness? Maybe I<br>was very glad to die. Didn’t I tell you plainly enough to-day that<br>you were torturing me, that I was... sick of you! You seem to want to<br>torture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my<br>recovery, because it’s continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov<br>went away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for<br>goodness’ sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force? Don’t<br>you see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How, how can<br>I persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness? I may be<br>ungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for God’s sake, let me be!<br>Let me be, let me be!”<br><br>He began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was<br>about to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had<br>been with Luzhin.<br><br>Razumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop.<br><br>“Well, go to hell then,” he said gently and thoughtfully. “Stay,” he<br>roared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. “Listen to me. Let me tell<br>you, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots! If you’ve any<br>little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you are<br>plagiarists even in that! There isn’t a sign of independent life in<br>you! You are made of spermaceti ointment and you’ve lymph in your veins<br>instead of blood. I don’t believe in anyone of you! In any circumstances<br>the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being! Stop!” he<br>cried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making<br>a movement--“hear me out! You know I’m having a house-warming this<br>evening, I dare say they’ve arrived by now, but I left my uncle there--I<br>just ran in--to receive the guests. And if you weren’t a fool, a common<br>fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...<br>you see, Rodya, I recognise you’re a clever fellow, but you’re a<br>fool!--and if you weren’t a fool you’d come round to me this evening<br>instead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have gone<br>out, there’s no help for it! I’d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady<br>has one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--any<br>way you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?”<br><br>“No.”<br><br>“R-rubbish!” Razumihin shouted, out of patience. “How do you know?<br>You can’t answer for yourself! You don’t know anything about it....<br>Thousands of times I’ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back<br>to them afterwards.... One feels ashamed and goes back to a man! So<br>remember, Potchinkov’s house on the third storey....”<br><br>“Why, Mr. Razumihin, I do believe you’d let anybody beat you from sheer<br>benevolence.”<br><br>“Beat? Whom? Me? I’d twist his nose off at the mere idea! Potchinkov’s<br>house, 47, Babushkin’s flat....”<br><br>“I shall not come, Razumihin.” Raskolnikov turned and walked away.<br><br>“I bet you will,” Razumihin shouted after him. “I refuse to know you if<br>you don’t! Stay, hey, is Zametov in there?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Did you see him?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Talked to him?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“What about? Confound you, don’t tell me then. Potchinkov’s house, 47,<br>Babushkin’s flat, remember!”<br><br>Raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into Sadovy Street.<br>Razumihin looked after him thoughtfully. Then with a wave of his hand he<br>went into the house but stopped short of the stairs.<br><br>“Confound it,” he went on almost aloud. “He talked sensibly but yet...<br>I am a fool! As if madmen didn’t talk sensibly! And this was just what<br>Zossimov seemed afraid of.” He struck his finger on his forehead. “What<br>if... how could I let him go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach,<br>what a blunder! I can’t.” And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but<br>there was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps to<br>the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.<br><br>Raskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge, stood in the middle, and<br>leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. On parting<br>with Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this<br>place. He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending<br>over the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the<br>sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at<br>one distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in<br>the last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,<br>and the water seemed to catch his attention. At last red circles flashed<br>before his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal<br>banks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he started,<br>saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. He<br>became aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked<br>and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow,<br>wasted face and red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but<br>obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she leaned her<br>right hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then<br>her left and threw herself into the canal. The filthy water parted and<br>swallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning<br>woman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head<br>and legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.<br><br>“A woman drowning! A woman drowning!” shouted dozens of voices; people<br>ran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people<br>crowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.<br><br>“Mercy on it! it’s our Afrosinya!” a woman cried tearfully close by.<br>“Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!”<br><br>“A boat, a boat” was shouted in the crowd. But there was no need of a<br>boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great<br>coat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her:<br>she floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of<br>her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a<br>comrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. They<br>laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recovered<br>consciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing,<br>stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.<br><br>“She’s drunk herself out of her senses,” the same woman’s voice wailed<br>at her side. “Out of her senses. The other day she tried to hang<br>herself, we cut her down. I ran out to the shop just now, left my little<br>girl to look after her--and here she’s in trouble again! A neighbour,<br>gentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end,<br>see yonder....”<br><br>The crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman, someone<br>mentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange<br>sensation of indifference and apathy. He felt disgusted. “No, that’s<br>loathsome... water... it’s not good enough,” he muttered to himself.<br>“Nothing will come of it,” he added, “no use to wait. What about the<br>police office...? And why isn’t Zametov at the police office? The police<br>office is open till ten o’clock....” He turned his back to the railing<br>and looked about him.<br><br>“Very well then!” he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and<br>walked in the direction of the police office. His heart felt hollow and<br>empty. He did not want to think. Even his depression had passed, there<br>was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out “to make an<br>end of it all.” Complete apathy had succeeded to it.<br><br>“Well, it’s a way out of it,” he thought, walking slowly and listlessly<br>along the canal bank. “Anyway I’ll make an end, for I want to.... But<br>is it a way out? What does it matter! There’ll be the square yard of<br>space--ha! But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or<br>not? Ah... damn! How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie<br>down soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But I don’t<br>care about that either! What idiotic ideas come into one’s head.”<br><br>To reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the<br>second turning to the left. It was only a few paces away. But at the<br>first turning he stopped and, after a minute’s thought, turned into a<br>side street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any<br>object, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking<br>at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted<br>his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.<br>He had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.<br>An overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into the<br>house, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the<br>right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.<br>The narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landing<br>and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework<br>of the window had been taken out. “That wasn’t so then,” he thought.<br>Here was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been<br>working. “It’s shut up and the door newly painted. So it’s to let.” Then<br>the third storey and the fourth. “Here!” He was perplexed to find the<br>door of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;<br>he had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last<br>stairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were<br>workmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he<br>would find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the<br>same places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed<br>strange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There<br>were two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the<br>other. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with<br>lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for<br>some reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper<br>with dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.<br>The workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were<br>hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took<br>no notice of Raskolnikov’s coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikov<br>folded his arms and listened.<br><br>“She comes to me in the morning,” said the elder to the younger, “very<br>early, all dressed up. ‘Why are you preening and prinking?’ says I. ‘I<br>am ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!’ That’s a way of<br>going on! And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!”<br><br>“And what is a fashion book?” the younger one asked. He obviously<br>regarded the other as an authority.<br><br>“A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the<br>tailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how<br>to dress, the male sex as well as the female. They’re pictures. The<br>gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies’ fluffles,<br>they’re beyond anything you can fancy.”<br><br>“There’s nothing you can’t find in Petersburg,” the younger cried<br>enthusiastically, “except father and mother, there’s everything!”<br><br>“Except them, there’s everything to be found, my boy,” the elder<br>declared sententiously.<br><br>Raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box,<br>the bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very<br>tiny without furniture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the<br>corner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it and<br>went to the window. The elder workman looked at him askance.<br><br>“What do you want?” he asked suddenly.<br><br>Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the<br>bell. The same bell, the same cracked note. He rang it a second and<br>a third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisingly<br>fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more<br>vividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more<br>satisfaction.<br><br>“Well, what do you want? Who are you?” the workman shouted, going out to<br>him. Raskolnikov went inside again.<br><br>“I want to take a flat,” he said. “I am looking round.”<br><br>“It’s not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought to come up<br>with the porter.”<br><br>“The floors have been washed, will they be painted?” Raskolnikov went<br>on. “Is there no blood?”<br><br>“What blood?”<br><br>“Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here. There was a<br>perfect pool there.”<br><br>“But who are you?” the workman cried, uneasy.<br><br>“Who am I?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“You want to know? Come to the police station, I’ll tell you.”<br><br>The workmen looked at him in amazement.<br><br>“It’s time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka. We must lock<br>up,” said the elder workman.<br><br>“Very well, come along,” said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going<br>out first, he went slowly downstairs. “Hey, porter,” he cried in the<br>gateway.<br><br>At the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by;<br>the two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.<br>Raskolnikov went straight up to them.<br><br>“What do you want?” asked one of the porters.<br><br>“Have you been to the police office?”<br><br>“I’ve just been there. What do you want?”<br><br>“Is it open?”<br><br>“Of course.”<br><br>“Is the assistant there?”<br><br>“He was there for a time. What do you want?”<br><br>Raskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.<br><br>“He’s been to look at the flat,” said the elder workman, coming forward.<br><br>“Which flat?”<br><br>“Where we are at work. ‘Why have you washed away the blood?’ says he.<br>‘There has been a murder here,’ says he, ‘and I’ve come to take it.’<br>And he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it. ‘Come to the police<br>station,’ says he. ‘I’ll tell you everything there.’ He wouldn’t leave<br>us.”<br><br>The porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.<br><br>“Who are you?” he shouted as impressively as he could.<br><br>“I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in<br>Shil’s house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he<br>knows me.” Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not<br>turning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.<br><br>“Why have you been to the flat?”<br><br>“To look at it.”<br><br>“What is there to look at?”<br><br>“Take him straight to the police station,” the man in the long coat<br>jerked in abruptly.<br><br>Raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the<br>same slow, lazy tones:<br><br>“Come along.”<br><br>“Yes, take him,” the man went on more confidently. “Why was he going<br>into _that_, what’s in his mind, eh?”<br><br>“He’s not drunk, but God knows what’s the matter with him,” muttered the<br>workman.<br><br>“But what do you want?” the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry<br>in earnest--“Why are you hanging about?”<br><br>“You funk the police station then?” said Raskolnikov jeeringly.<br><br>“How funk it? Why are you hanging about?”<br><br>“He’s a rogue!” shouted the peasant woman.<br><br>“Why waste time talking to him?” cried the other porter, a huge peasant<br>in a full open coat and with keys on his belt. “Get along! He is a rogue<br>and no mistake. Get along!”<br><br>And seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street. He<br>lurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators in<br>silence and walked away.<br><br>“Strange man!” observed the workman.<br><br>“There are strange folks about nowadays,” said the woman.<br><br>“You should have taken him to the police station all the same,” said the<br>man in the long coat.<br><br>“Better have nothing to do with him,” decided the big porter. “A regular<br>rogue! Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you<br>won’t get rid of him.... We know the sort!”<br><br>“Shall I go there or not?” thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middle<br>of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as<br>though expecting from someone a decisive word. But no sound came, all<br>was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to<br>him alone.... All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards<br>away, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.<br>In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the<br>middle of the street. “What is it?” Raskolnikov turned to the right<br>and went up to the crowd. He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled<br>coldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to<br>the police station and knew that it would all soon be over.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of<br>spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got<br>off his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....<br>A mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One<br>of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying<br>close to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the<br>coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:<br><br>“What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!”<br><br>Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last<br>in seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a<br>man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with<br>blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was<br>flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and<br>disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.<br><br>“Merciful heaven!” wailed the coachman, “what more could I do? If I’d<br>been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly,<br>not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody<br>else. A drunken man can’t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him<br>crossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again<br>and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell<br>straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very<br>tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started,<br>he screamed... that made them worse. That’s how it happened!”<br><br>“That’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed.<br><br>“He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice<br>declared.<br><br>“Three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third.<br><br>But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was<br>evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who<br>was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little<br>anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to<br>take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew<br>his name.<br><br>Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The<br>lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face. He recognised<br>him.<br><br>“I know him! I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front. “It’s a<br>government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close<br>by in Kozel’s house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?” He<br>pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in<br>violent agitation.<br><br>The police were glad that they had found out who the man was.<br>Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it<br>had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious<br>Marmeladov to his lodging at once.<br><br>“Just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to<br>Kozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him,<br>he is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one<br>daughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is<br>sure to be a doctor in the house. I’ll pay, I’ll pay! At least he will<br>be looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he’ll die<br>before you get him to the hospital.” He managed to slip something<br>unseen into the policeman’s hand. But the thing was straightforward<br>and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the<br>injured man; people volunteered to help.<br><br>Kozel’s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind,<br>carefully holding Marmeladov’s head and showing the way.<br><br>“This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn<br>round! I’ll pay, I’ll make it worth your while,” he muttered.<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free<br>moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and<br>back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself<br>and coughing. Of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest<br>girl, Polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not<br>understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so<br>always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost<br>to appear to understand. This time Polenka was undressing her little<br>brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. The boy was<br>waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night.<br>He was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent,<br>serious face, with his legs stretched out straight before him--heels<br>together and toes turned out.<br><br>He was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, sitting<br>perfectly still with pouting lips and wide-open eyes, just as all good<br>little boys have to sit when they are undressed to go to bed. A little<br>girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen,<br>waiting for her turn. The door on to the stairs was open to relieve<br>them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the<br>other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor,<br>consumptive woman. Katerina Ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner<br>during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than<br>ever.<br><br>“You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking<br>about the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house<br>and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!<br>Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that<br>everyone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch,<br>as our governor!’ When I... when...” she coughed violently, “oh, cursed<br>life,” she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her<br>breast, “when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal’s...<br>Princess Bezzemelny saw me--who gave me the blessing when your father<br>and I were married, Polenka--she asked at once ‘Isn’t that the pretty<br>girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?’ (You must mend<br>that tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or<br>to-morrow--cough, cough, cough--he will make the hole bigger,” she<br>articulated with effort.) “Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just<br>come from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to<br>make me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions<br>and told him that my heart had long been another’s. That other was your<br>father, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me<br>the shirt, and the stockings! Lida,” said she to the youngest one, “you<br>must manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out<br>with it... I’ll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond<br>doesn’t come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout,<br>he has torn it to rags! I’d do it all together, so as not to have to<br>work two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again!<br>What’s this?” she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men,<br>who were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. “What is it? What are<br>they bringing? Mercy on us!”<br><br>“Where are we to put him?” asked the policeman, looking round when<br>Marmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in.<br><br>“On the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way,”<br> Raskolnikov showed him.<br><br>“Run over in the road! Drunk!” someone shouted in the passage.<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. The<br>children were terrified. Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and<br>clutched at her, trembling all over.<br><br>Having laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.<br><br>“For God’s sake be calm, don’t be frightened!” he said, speaking<br>quickly, “he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don’t<br>be frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here... I’ve been<br>here already, you remember? He will come to; I’ll pay!”<br><br>“He’s done it this time!” Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she<br>rushed to her husband.<br><br>Raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who<br>swoon easily. She instantly placed under the luckless man’s head a<br>pillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining<br>him. She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips<br>and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.<br><br>Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was a<br>doctor, it appeared, next door but one.<br><br>“I’ve sent for a doctor,” he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, “don’t be<br>uneasy, I’ll pay. Haven’t you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel,<br>anything, as quick as you can.... He is injured, but not killed, believe<br>me.... We shall see what the doctor says!”<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the<br>corner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in<br>readiness for washing her children’s and husband’s linen that night.<br>This washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a<br>week, if not oftener. For the family had come to such a pass that they<br>were practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could<br>not endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she<br>preferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when<br>the rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry<br>by the morning. She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov’s request,<br>but almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had already<br>succeeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off<br>Marmeladov’s face.<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands<br>to her breast. She was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began<br>to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man<br>brought here. The policeman, too, stood in hesitation.<br><br>“Polenka,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, “run to Sonia, make haste. If you<br>don’t find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over<br>and that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. Run, Polenka!<br>there, put on the shawl.”<br><br>“Run your fastest!” cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after<br>which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his<br>heels thrust forward and his toes spread out.<br><br>Meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn’t have<br>dropped a pin. The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a<br>time, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. Almost<br>all Madame Lippevechsel’s lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms<br>of the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but<br>afterwards they overflowed into the room. Katerina Ivanovna flew into a<br>fury.<br><br>“You might let him die in peace, at least,” she shouted at the crowd,<br>“is it a spectacle for you to gape at? With cigarettes! (Cough, cough,<br>cough!) You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his<br>hat!... Get away! You should respect the dead, at least!”<br><br>Her cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result. They<br>evidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna. The lodgers, one after<br>another, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling<br>of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden<br>accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which<br>no living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and<br>compassion.<br><br>Voices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying<br>that they’d no business to make a disturbance here.<br><br>“No business to die!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing to<br>the door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to<br>face with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident<br>and ran in to restore order. She was a particularly quarrelsome and<br>irresponsible German.<br><br>“Ah, my God!” she cried, clasping her hands, “your husband drunken<br>horses have trampled! To the hospital with him! I am the landlady!”<br><br>“Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,”<br> Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with<br>the landlady that she might “remember her place” and even now could not<br>deny herself this satisfaction). “Amalia Ludwigovna...”<br><br>“I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may<br>not dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna.”<br><br>“You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am not<br>one of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who’s laughing<br>behind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of ‘they are at it<br>again’ was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you<br>Amalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike that<br>name. You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;<br>he is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.<br>Let him at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General,<br>himself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow. The prince knew<br>me as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been<br>a benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many<br>friends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable<br>pride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to<br>Raskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has<br>wealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a<br>child. You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna...”<br><br>All this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,<br>but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna’s eloquence. At that<br>instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she<br>ran to him. The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or<br>understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drew<br>deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth<br>and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognising<br>Raskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked<br>at him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.<br><br>“My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding,” she said<br>in despair. “We must take off his clothes. Turn a little, Semyon<br>Zaharovitch, if you can,” she cried to him.<br><br>Marmeladov recognised her.<br><br>“A priest,” he articulated huskily.<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window<br>frame and exclaimed in despair:<br><br>“Oh, cursed life!”<br><br>“A priest,” the dying man said again after a moment’s silence.<br><br>“They’ve gone for him,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her<br>shout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she<br>returned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for<br>long.<br><br>Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in<br>the corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her<br>wondering childish eyes.<br><br>“A-ah,” he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.<br><br>“What now?” cried Katerina Ivanovna.<br><br>“Barefoot, barefoot!” he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the<br>child’s bare feet.<br><br>“Be silent,” Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, “you know why she is<br>barefooted.”<br><br>“Thank God, the doctor,” exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved.<br><br>The doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about<br>him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully<br>felt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the<br>blood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man’s chest. It was gashed,<br>crushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.<br>On the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking<br>yellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse’s hoof. The doctor<br>frowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and<br>turned round with it for thirty yards on the road.<br><br>“It’s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,” the doctor<br>whispered softly to Raskolnikov.<br><br>“What do you think of him?” he asked.<br><br>“He will die immediately.”<br><br>“Is there really no hope?”<br><br>“Not the faintest! He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured,<br>too... Hm... I could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless.<br>He is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes.”<br><br>“Better bleed him then.”<br><br>“If you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless.”<br><br>At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,<br>and the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing<br>the sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.<br>The doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.<br>Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged his<br>shoulders and remained.<br><br>All stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably<br>understood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.<br>Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt<br>down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of<br>her. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his<br>little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with<br>precision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which<br>seemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her<br>lips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling<br>straight the boy’s shirt, and managed to cover the girl’s bare shoulders<br>with a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her<br>knees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was<br>opened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators from<br>all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not<br>venture beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.<br><br>At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She<br>came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for<br>her mother, went up to her and said, “She’s coming, I met her in the<br>street.” Her mother made her kneel beside her.<br><br>Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,<br>and strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,<br>death and despair. She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of<br>the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,<br>unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the<br>doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.<br>She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with<br>its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the<br>whole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought<br>with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat<br>with its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat<br>was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in<br>terror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather<br>pretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the<br>priest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some<br>words in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a<br>step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.<br><br>The service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.<br>The priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and<br>consolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.<br><br>“What am I to do with these?” she interrupted sharply and irritably,<br>pointing to the little ones.<br><br>“God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour,” the priest began.<br><br>“Ach! He is merciful, but not to us.”<br><br>“That’s a sin, a sin, madam,” observed the priest, shaking his head.<br><br>“And isn’t that a sin?” cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying<br>man.<br><br>“Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to<br>compensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings.”<br><br>“You don’t understand!” cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.<br>“And why should they compensate me? Why, he was drunk and threw himself<br>under the horses! What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.<br>He drank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get drink, he<br>wasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God he’s dying! One<br>less to keep!”<br><br>“You must forgive in the hour of death, that’s a sin, madam, such<br>feelings are a great sin.”<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,<br>wiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,<br>and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Now<br>she flew at him almost in a frenzy.<br><br>“Ah, father! That’s words and only words! Forgive! If he’d not been run<br>over, he’d have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and<br>in rags and he’d have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been<br>sousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children’s<br>and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I<br>should have been darning them. That’s how I spend my nights!... What’s<br>the use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!”<br><br>A terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchief<br>to her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her<br>aching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed<br>his head and said nothing.<br><br>Marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face<br>of Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again. He kept trying<br>to say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and<br>articulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he<br>wanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:<br><br>“Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say!” And the sick man<br>was silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the<br>doorway and he saw Sonia.<br><br>Till then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a<br>corner.<br><br>“Who’s that? Who’s that?” he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice,<br>in agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his<br>daughter was standing, and trying to sit up.<br><br>“Lie down! Lie do-own!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.<br><br>With unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his<br>elbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as<br>though not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.<br>Suddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and<br>gaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying<br>father. His face showed intense suffering.<br><br>“Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!” he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand<br>to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on<br>the floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he<br>was dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so<br>without moving. He died in her arms.<br><br>“He’s got what he wanted,” Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband’s<br>dead body. “Well, what’s to be done now? How am I to bury him! What can<br>I give them to-morrow to eat?”<br><br>Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.<br><br>“Katerina Ivanovna,” he began, “last week your husband told me all his<br>life and circumstances.... Believe me, he spoke of you with passionate<br>reverence. From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you<br>all and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,<br>in spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became<br>friends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my<br>dead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any<br>assistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I will<br>be sure to come again... I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....<br>Good-bye!”<br><br>And he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd<br>to the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim<br>Fomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions<br>in person. They had not met since the scene at the police station, but<br>Nikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.<br><br>“Ah, is that you?” he asked him.<br><br>“He’s dead,” answered Raskolnikov. “The doctor and the priest have been,<br>all as it should have been. Don’t worry the poor woman too much, she is<br>in consumption as it is. Try and cheer her up, if possible... you are a<br>kind-hearted man, I know...” he added with a smile, looking straight in<br>his face.<br><br>“But you are spattered with blood,” observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing<br>in the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov’s waistcoat.<br><br>“Yes... I’m covered with blood,” Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;<br>then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.<br><br>He walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious<br>of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and<br>strength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be<br>compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been<br>pardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on<br>his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting<br>with him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid<br>footsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was<br>running after him, calling “Wait! wait!”<br><br>He turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped<br>short a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov<br>could distinguish the child’s thin but pretty little face, looking at<br>him with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a message<br>which she was evidently glad to give.<br><br>“Tell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?” she said<br>hurriedly in a breathless voice.<br><br>He laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of<br>rapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said<br>why.<br><br>“Who sent you?”<br><br>“Sister Sonia sent me,” answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.<br><br>“I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.”<br><br>“Mamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,<br>too, and said ‘Run fast, Polenka.’”<br><br>“Do you love sister Sonia?”<br><br>“I love her more than anyone,” Polenka answered with a peculiar<br>earnestness, and her smile became graver.<br><br>“And will you love me?”<br><br>By way of answer he saw the little girl’s face approaching him, her full<br>lips naïvely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks<br>held him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl<br>wept softly, pressing her face against him.<br><br>“I am sorry for father,” she said a moment later, raising her<br>tear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. “It’s<br>nothing but misfortunes now,” she added suddenly with that peculiarly<br>sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak<br>like grown-up people.<br><br>“Did your father love you?”<br><br>“He loved Lida most,” she went on very seriously without a smile,<br>exactly like grown-up people, “he loved her because she is little and<br>because she is ill, too. And he always used to bring her presents. But<br>he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too,” she added with<br>dignity. “And mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she<br>liked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach me French,<br>for it’s time my education began.”<br><br>“And do you know your prayers?”<br><br>“Of course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myself<br>as I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.<br>First they repeat the ‘Ave Maria’ and then another prayer: ‘Lord,<br>forgive and bless sister Sonia,’ and then another, ‘Lord, forgive and<br>bless our second father.’ For our elder father is dead and this is<br>another one, but we do pray for the other as well.”<br><br>“Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, too. ‘And Thy<br>servant Rodion,’ nothing more.”<br><br>“I’ll pray for you all the rest of my life,” the little girl declared<br>hotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him<br>warmly once more.<br><br>Raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to<br>come next day. The child went away quite enchanted with him. It was past<br>ten when he came out into the street. In five minutes he was standing on<br>the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.<br><br>“Enough,” he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. “I’ve done with<br>fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! haven’t I lived<br>just now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of<br>Heaven to her--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for the<br>reign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and now<br>we will see! We will try our strength!” he added defiantly, as though<br>challenging some power of darkness. “And I was ready to consent to live<br>in a square of space!<br><br>“I am very weak at this moment, but... I believe my illness is all over.<br>I knew it would be over when I went out. By the way, Potchinkov’s house<br>is only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even if<br>it were not close by... let him win his bet! Let us give him some<br>satisfaction, too--no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, you<br>can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that’s<br>what they don’t know,” he added proudly and self-confidently and<br>he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride and<br>self-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming<br>a different man every moment. What was it had happened to work this<br>revolution in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a<br>straw, he suddenly felt that he, too, ‘could live, that there was still<br>life for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.’ Perhaps he<br>was in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of<br>that.<br><br>“But I did ask her to remember ‘Thy servant Rodion’ in her prayers,” the<br>idea struck him. “Well, that was... in case of emergency,” he added and<br>laughed himself at his boyish sally. He was in the best of spirits.<br><br>He easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at<br>Potchinkov’s and the porter at once showed him the way. Half-way<br>upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big<br>gathering of people. The door was wide open on the stairs; he could<br>hear exclamations and discussion. Razumihin’s room was fairly large; the<br>company consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the entry,<br>where two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind a screen with two<br>samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up<br>from the landlady’s kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran<br>out delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a<br>great deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite<br>drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.<br><br>“Listen,” Raskolnikov hastened to say, “I’ve only just come to tell you<br>you’ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to<br>him. I can’t come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. And<br>so good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.”<br><br>“Do you know what? I’ll see you home. If you say you’re weak yourself,<br>you must...”<br><br>“And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped<br>out?”<br><br>“He? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle’s, I expect, or perhaps<br>he has come without being invited... I’ll leave uncle with them, he<br>is an invaluable person, pity I can’t introduce you to him now. But<br>confound them all now! They won’t notice me, and I need a little fresh<br>air, for you’ve come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and I<br>should have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...<br>you simply can’t imagine what men will say! Though why shouldn’t you<br>imagine? Don’t we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... that’s the<br>way to learn not to!... Wait a minute, I’ll fetch Zossimov.”<br><br>Zossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special<br>interest in him; soon his face brightened.<br><br>“You must go to bed at once,” he pronounced, examining the patient as<br>far as he could, “and take something for the night. Will you take it? I<br>got it ready some time ago... a powder.”<br><br>“Two, if you like,” answered Raskolnikov. The powder was taken at once.<br><br>“It’s a good thing you are taking him home,” observed Zossimov to<br>Razumihin--“we shall see how he is to-morrow, to-day he’s not at all<br>amiss--a considerable change since the afternoon. Live and learn...”<br><br>“Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?”<br> Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. “I won’t tell<br>you everything, brother, because they are such fools. Zossimov told me<br>to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and<br>afterwards I am to tell him about it, for he’s got a notion in his head<br>that you are... mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the first place,<br>you’ve three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad,<br>you needn’t care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly,<br>that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental<br>diseases, and what’s brought him to this conclusion about you was your<br>conversation to-day with Zametov.”<br><br>“Zametov told you all about it?”<br><br>“Yes, and he did well. Now I understand what it all means and so does<br>Zametov.... Well, the fact is, Rodya... the point is... I am a little<br>drunk now.... But that’s... no matter... the point is that this<br>idea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... you<br>understand? That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea<br>is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that<br>bubble’s burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave<br>Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that’s between ourselves,<br>brother; please don’t let out a hint that you know of it; I’ve noticed<br>he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna’s. But to-day, to-day<br>it’s all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He<br>took advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed<br>of it himself now; I know that...”<br><br>Raskolnikov listened greedily. Razumihin was drunk enough to talk too<br>freely.<br><br>“I fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint,” said<br>Raskolnikov.<br><br>“No need to explain that! And it wasn’t the paint only: the fever had<br>been coming on for a month; Zossimov testifies to that! But how crushed<br>that boy is now, you wouldn’t believe! ‘I am not worth his little<br>finger,’ he says. Yours, he means. He has good feelings at times,<br>brother. But the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the Palais<br>de Cristal, that was too good for anything! You frightened him at first,<br>you know, he nearly went into convulsions! You almost convinced<br>him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you<br>suddenly--put out your tongue at him: ‘There now, what do you make of<br>it?’ It was perfect! He is crushed, annihilated now! It was masterly, by<br>Jove, it’s what they deserve! Ah, that I wasn’t there! He was hoping to<br>see you awfully. Porfiry, too, wants to make your acquaintance...”<br><br>“Ah!... he too... but why did they put me down as mad?”<br><br>“Oh, not mad. I must have said too much, brother.... What struck him,<br>you see, was that only that subject seemed to interest you; now it’s<br>clear why it did interest you; knowing all the circumstances... and<br>how that irritated you and worked in with your illness... I am a little<br>drunk, brother, only, confound him, he has some idea of his own... I<br>tell you, he’s mad on mental diseases. But don’t you mind him...”<br><br>For half a minute both were silent.<br><br>“Listen, Razumihin,” began Raskolnikov, “I want to tell you plainly:<br>I’ve just been at a death-bed, a clerk who died... I gave them all my<br>money... and besides I’ve just been kissed by someone who, if I had<br>killed anyone, would just the same... in fact I saw someone else<br>there... with a flame-coloured feather... but I am talking nonsense; I<br>am very weak, support me... we shall be at the stairs directly...”<br><br>“What’s the matter? What’s the matter with you?” Razumihin asked<br>anxiously.<br><br>“I am a little giddy, but that’s not the point, I am so sad, so sad...<br>like a woman. Look, what’s that? Look, look!”<br><br>“What is it?”<br><br>“Don’t you see? A light in my room, you see? Through the crack...”<br><br>They were already at the foot of the last flight of stairs, at the level<br>of the landlady’s door, and they could, as a fact, see from below that<br>there was a light in Raskolnikov’s garret.<br><br>“Queer! Nastasya, perhaps,” observed Razumihin.<br><br>“She is never in my room at this time and she must be in bed long ago,<br>but... I don’t care! Good-bye!”<br><br>“What do you mean? I am coming with you, we’ll come in together!”<br><br>“I know we are going in together, but I want to shake hands here and say<br>good-bye to you here. So give me your hand, good-bye!”<br><br>“What’s the matter with you, Rodya?”<br><br>“Nothing... come along... you shall be witness.”<br><br>They began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck Razumihin that<br>perhaps Zossimov might be right after all. “Ah, I’ve upset him with my<br>chatter!” he muttered to himself.<br><br>When they reached the door they heard voices in the room.<br><br>“What is it?” cried Razumihin. Raskolnikov was the first to open the<br>door; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered.<br><br>His mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an<br>hour and a half for him. Why had he never expected, never thought of<br>them, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would<br>arrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day? They had<br>spent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She was<br>standing before them and had told them everything by now. They were<br>beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his “running away”<br> to-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious! “Good<br>Heavens, what had become of him?” Both had been weeping, both had been<br>in anguish for that hour and a half.<br><br>A cry of joy, of ecstasy, greeted Raskolnikov’s entrance. Both rushed to<br>him. But he stood like one dead; a sudden intolerable sensation struck<br>him like a thunderbolt. He did not lift his arms to embrace them, he<br>could not. His mother and sister clasped him in their arms, kissed him,<br>laughed and cried. He took a step, tottered and fell to the ground,<br>fainting.<br><br>Anxiety, cries of horror, moans... Razumihin who was standing in the<br>doorway flew into the room, seized the sick man in his strong arms and<br>in a moment had him on the sofa.<br><br>“It’s nothing, nothing!” he cried to the mother and sister--“it’s only a<br>faint, a mere trifle! Only just now the doctor said he was much better,<br>that he is perfectly well! Water! See, he is coming to himself, he is<br>all right again!”<br><br>And seizing Dounia by the arm so that he almost dislocated it, he made<br>her bend down to see that “he is all right again.” The mother and sister<br>looked on him with emotion and gratitude, as their Providence. They<br>had heard already from Nastasya all that had been done for their Rodya<br>during his illness, by this “very competent young man,” as Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna Raskolnikov called him that evening in conversation with<br>Dounia.<br><br><br><br><br>PART III<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>Raskolnikov got up, and sat down on the sofa. He waved his hand weakly<br>to Razumihin to cut short the flow of warm and incoherent consolations<br>he was addressing to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand<br>and for a minute or two gazed from one to the other without speaking.<br>His mother was alarmed by his expression. It revealed an emotion<br>agonisingly poignant, and at the same time something immovable, almost<br>insane. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.<br><br>Avdotya Romanovna was pale; her hand trembled in her brother’s.<br><br>“Go home... with him,” he said in a broken voice, pointing to Razumihin,<br>“good-bye till to-morrow; to-morrow everything... Is it long since you<br>arrived?”<br><br>“This evening, Rodya,” answered Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “the train was<br>awfully late. But, Rodya, nothing would induce me to leave you now! I<br>will spend the night here, near you...”<br><br>“Don’t torture me!” he said with a gesture of irritation.<br><br>“I will stay with him,” cried Razumihin, “I won’t leave him for a<br>moment. Bother all my visitors! Let them rage to their hearts’ content!<br>My uncle is presiding there.”<br><br>“How, how can I thank you!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna was beginning, once<br>more pressing Razumihin’s hands, but Raskolnikov interrupted her again.<br><br>“I can’t have it! I can’t have it!” he repeated irritably, “don’t worry<br>me! Enough, go away... I can’t stand it!”<br><br>“Come, mamma, come out of the room at least for a minute,” Dounia<br>whispered in dismay; “we are distressing him, that’s evident.”<br><br>“Mayn’t I look at him after three years?” wept Pulcheria Alexandrovna.<br><br>“Stay,” he stopped them again, “you keep interrupting me, and my ideas<br>get muddled.... Have you seen Luzhin?”<br><br>“No, Rodya, but he knows already of our arrival. We have heard, Rodya,<br>that Pyotr Petrovitch was so kind as to visit you today,” Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna added somewhat timidly.<br><br>“Yes... he was so kind... Dounia, I promised Luzhin I’d throw him<br>downstairs and told him to go to hell....”<br><br>“Rodya, what are you saying! Surely, you don’t mean to tell us...”<br> Pulcheria Alexandrovna began in alarm, but she stopped, looking at<br>Dounia.<br><br>Avdotya Romanovna was looking attentively at her brother, waiting<br>for what would come next. Both of them had heard of the quarrel from<br>Nastasya, so far as she had succeeded in understanding and reporting it,<br>and were in painful perplexity and suspense.<br><br>“Dounia,” Raskolnikov continued with an effort, “I don’t want that<br>marriage, so at the first opportunity to-morrow you must refuse Luzhin,<br>so that we may never hear his name again.”<br><br>“Good Heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.<br><br>“Brother, think what you are saying!” Avdotya Romanovna began<br>impetuously, but immediately checked herself. “You are not fit to talk<br>now, perhaps; you are tired,” she added gently.<br><br>“You think I am delirious? No... You are marrying Luzhin for _my_<br>sake. But I won’t accept the sacrifice. And so write a letter before<br>to-morrow, to refuse him... Let me read it in the morning and that will<br>be the end of it!”<br><br>“That I can’t do!” the girl cried, offended, “what right have you...”<br><br>“Dounia, you are hasty, too, be quiet, to-morrow... Don’t you see...”<br> the mother interposed in dismay. “Better come away!”<br><br>“He is raving,” Razumihin cried tipsily, “or how would he dare!<br>To-morrow all this nonsense will be over... to-day he certainly did<br>drive him away. That was so. And Luzhin got angry, too.... He made<br>speeches here, wanted to show off his learning and he went out<br>crest-fallen....”<br><br>“Then it’s true?” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.<br><br>“Good-bye till to-morrow, brother,” said Dounia compassionately--“let us<br>go, mother... Good-bye, Rodya.”<br><br>“Do you hear, sister,” he repeated after them, making a last effort,<br>“I am not delirious; this marriage is--an infamy. Let me act like<br>a scoundrel, but you mustn’t... one is enough... and though I am a<br>scoundrel, I wouldn’t own such a sister. It’s me or Luzhin! Go now....”<br><br>“But you’re out of your mind! Despot!” roared Razumihin; but Raskolnikov<br>did not and perhaps could not answer. He lay down on the sofa, and<br>turned to the wall, utterly exhausted. Avdotya Romanovna looked with<br>interest at Razumihin; her black eyes flashed; Razumihin positively<br>started at her glance.<br><br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna stood overwhelmed.<br><br>“Nothing would induce me to go,” she whispered in despair to Razumihin.<br>“I will stay somewhere here... escort Dounia home.”<br><br>“You’ll spoil everything,” Razumihin answered in the same whisper,<br>losing patience--“come out on to the stairs, anyway. Nastasya, show a<br>light! I assure you,” he went on in a half whisper on the stairs--“that<br>he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you<br>understand? The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as not<br>to irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once<br>and slipped off. And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this<br>time of night, and will do himself some mischief....”<br><br>“What are you saying?”<br><br>“And Avdotya Romanovna can’t possibly be left in those lodgings without<br>you. Just think where you are staying! That blackguard Pyotr Petrovitch<br>couldn’t find you better lodgings... But you know I’ve had a little to<br>drink, and that’s what makes me... swear; don’t mind it....”<br><br>“But I’ll go to the landlady here,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted,<br>“I’ll beseech her to find some corner for Dounia and me for the night. I<br>can’t leave him like that, I cannot!”<br><br>This conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady’s<br>door. Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was in<br>extraordinary excitement. Half an hour earlier, while he was bringing<br>Raskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of<br>it himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he<br>had imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he<br>had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood with<br>the two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving<br>them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every<br>word he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their<br>hands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the<br>least regard for good manners. They sometimes pulled their hands out of<br>his huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew<br>them all the closer to him. If they’d told him to jump head foremost<br>from the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation<br>in their service. Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man<br>was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety<br>over her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was<br>unwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya Romanovna<br>shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not<br>see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. It<br>was only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya’s account of her<br>brother’s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from<br>him, and to persuade her mother to do the same. She realised, too,<br>that even running away was perhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later,<br>however, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of<br>Razumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might<br>be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.<br><br>“You can’t go to the landlady, that’s perfect nonsense!” he cried. “If<br>you stay, though you are his mother, you’ll drive him to a frenzy, and<br>then goodness knows what will happen! Listen, I’ll tell you what I’ll<br>do: Nastasya will stay with him now, and I’ll conduct you both home, you<br>can’t be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that<br>way.... But no matter! Then I’ll run straight back here and a quarter of<br>an hour later, on my word of honour, I’ll bring you news how he is,<br>whether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! Then I’ll run home in<br>a twinkling--I’ve a lot of friends there, all drunk--I’ll fetch<br>Zossimov--that’s the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too,<br>but he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk! I’ll drag him<br>to Rodya, and then to you, so that you’ll get two reports in the<br>hour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that’s a<br>very different thing from my account of him! If there’s anything wrong,<br>I swear I’ll bring you here myself, but, if it’s all right, you go to<br>bed. And I’ll spend the night here, in the passage, he won’t hear me,<br>and I’ll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady’s, to be at hand. Which<br>is better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But the<br>landlady is out of the question; it’s all right for me, but it’s out of<br>the question for you: she wouldn’t take you, for she’s... for she’s a<br>fool... She’d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you,<br>too, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is an<br>absolutely, absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool, too!...<br>No matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?”<br><br>“Let us go, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna, “he will certainly do what<br>he has promised. He has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor really<br>will consent to spend the night here, what could be better?”<br><br>“You see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!”<br> Razumihin cried in ecstasy, “let us go! Nastasya! Fly upstairs and sit<br>with him with a light; I’ll come in a quarter of an hour.”<br><br>Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no<br>further resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down<br>the stairs. He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and<br>good-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed in<br>such a condition....<br><br>“Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition!” Razumihin broke in upon<br>her thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with huge<br>steps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he<br>did not observe, however. “Nonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool,<br>but that’s not it; I am not drunk from wine. It’s seeing you has turned<br>my head... But don’t mind me! Don’t take any notice: I am talking<br>nonsense, I am not worthy of you.... I am utterly unworthy of you! The<br>minute I’ve taken you home, I’ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over<br>my head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right.... If only<br>you knew how I love you both! Don’t laugh, and don’t be angry! You may<br>be angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his friend, and therefore I<br>am your friend, too, I want to be... I had a presentiment... Last year<br>there was a moment... though it wasn’t a presentiment really, for<br>you seem to have fallen from heaven. And I expect I shan’t sleep all<br>night... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...<br>that’s why he mustn’t be irritated.”<br><br>“What do you say?” cried the mother.<br><br>“Did the doctor really say that?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed.<br><br>“Yes, but it’s not so, not a bit of it. He gave him some medicine, a<br>powder, I saw it, and then your coming here.... Ah! It would have been<br>better if you had come to-morrow. It’s a good thing we went away. And in<br>an hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything. He is not<br>drunk! And I shan’t be drunk.... And what made me get so tight? Because<br>they got me into an argument, damn them! I’ve sworn never to argue! They<br>talk such trash! I almost came to blows! I’ve left my uncle to preside.<br>Would you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualism<br>and that’s just what they relish! Not to be themselves, to be as unlike<br>themselves as they can. That’s what they regard as the highest point of<br>progress. If only their nonsense were their own, but as it is...”<br><br>“Listen!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna interrupted timidly, but it only added<br>fuel to the flames.<br><br>“What do you think?” shouted Razumihin, louder than ever, “you think I<br>am attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk<br>nonsense. That’s man’s one privilege over all creation. Through error<br>you come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any<br>truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and<br>fourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can’t even make<br>mistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense,<br>and I’ll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one’s own way is better than<br>to go right in someone else’s. In the first case you are a man, in the<br>second you’re no better than a bird. Truth won’t escape you, but life<br>can be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now?<br>In science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism,<br>judgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are<br>still in the preparatory class at school. We prefer to live on other<br>people’s ideas, it’s what we are used to! Am I right, am I right?” cried<br>Razumihin, pressing and shaking the two ladies’ hands.<br><br>“Oh, mercy, I do not know,” cried poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna.<br><br>“Yes, yes... though I don’t agree with you in everything,” added Avdotya<br>Romanovna earnestly and at once uttered a cry, for he squeezed her hand<br>so painfully.<br><br>“Yes, you say yes... well after that you... you...” he cried in<br>a transport, “you are a fount of goodness, purity, sense... and<br>perfection. Give me your hand... you give me yours, too! I want to kiss<br>your hands here at once, on my knees...” and he fell on his knees on the<br>pavement, fortunately at that time deserted.<br><br>“Leave off, I entreat you, what are you doing?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna<br>cried, greatly distressed.<br><br>“Get up, get up!” said Dounia laughing, though she, too, was upset.<br><br>“Not for anything till you let me kiss your hands! That’s it! Enough! I<br>get up and we’ll go on! I am a luckless fool, I am unworthy of you and<br>drunk... and I am ashamed.... I am not worthy to love you, but to do<br>homage to you is the duty of every man who is not a perfect beast! And<br>I’ve done homage.... Here are your lodgings, and for that alone Rodya<br>was right in driving your Pyotr Petrovitch away.... How dare he! how<br>dare he put you in such lodgings! It’s a scandal! Do you know the<br>sort of people they take in here? And you his betrothed! You are<br>his betrothed? Yes? Well, then, I’ll tell you, your _fiancé_ is a<br>scoundrel.”<br><br>“Excuse me, Mr. Razumihin, you are forgetting...” Pulcheria Alexandrovna<br>was beginning.<br><br>“Yes, yes, you are right, I did forget myself, I am ashamed of it,”<br> Razumihin made haste to apologise. “But... but you can’t be angry with<br>me for speaking so! For I speak sincerely and not because... hm, hm!<br>That would be disgraceful; in fact not because I’m in... hm! Well,<br>anyway, I won’t say why, I daren’t.... But we all saw to-day when he<br>came in that that man is not of our sort. Not because he had his hair<br>curled at the barber’s, not because he was in such a hurry to show his<br>wit, but because he is a spy, a speculator, because he is a skin-flint<br>and a buffoon. That’s evident. Do you think him clever? No, he is a<br>fool, a fool. And is he a match for you? Good heavens! Do you see,<br>ladies?” he stopped suddenly on the way upstairs to their rooms, “though<br>all my friends there are drunk, yet they are all honest, and though we<br>do talk a lot of trash, and I do, too, yet we shall talk our way to the<br>truth at last, for we are on the right path, while Pyotr Petrovitch...<br>is not on the right path. Though I’ve been calling them all sorts of<br>names just now, I do respect them all... though I don’t respect Zametov,<br>I like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he<br>is an honest man and knows his work. But enough, it’s all said and<br>forgiven. Is it forgiven? Well, then, let’s go on. I know this corridor,<br>I’ve been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3.... Where are you<br>here? Which number? eight? Well, lock yourselves in for the night, then.<br>Don’t let anybody in. In a quarter of an hour I’ll come back with news,<br>and half an hour later I’ll bring Zossimov, you’ll see! Good-bye, I’ll<br>run.”<br><br>“Good heavens, Dounia, what is going to happen?” said Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna, addressing her daughter with anxiety and dismay.<br><br>“Don’t worry yourself, mother,” said Dounia, taking off her hat and<br>cape. “God has sent this gentleman to our aid, though he has come from a<br>drinking party. We can depend on him, I assure you. And all that he has<br>done for Rodya....”<br><br>“Ah. Dounia, goodness knows whether he will come! How could I bring<br>myself to leave Rodya?... And how different, how different I had fancied<br>our meeting! How sullen he was, as though not pleased to see us....”<br><br>Tears came into her eyes.<br><br>“No, it’s not that, mother. You didn’t see, you were crying all the<br>time. He is quite unhinged by serious illness--that’s the reason.”<br><br>“Ah, that illness! What will happen, what will happen? And how he talked<br>to you, Dounia!” said the mother, looking timidly at her daughter,<br>trying to read her thoughts and, already half consoled by Dounia’s<br>standing up for her brother, which meant that she had already forgiven<br>him. “I am sure he will think better of it to-morrow,” she added,<br>probing her further.<br><br>“And I am sure that he will say the same to-morrow... about that,”<br> Avdotya Romanovna said finally. And, of course, there was no going<br>beyond that, for this was a point which Pulcheria Alexandrovna was<br>afraid to discuss. Dounia went up and kissed her mother. The latter<br>warmly embraced her without speaking. Then she sat down to wait<br>anxiously for Razumihin’s return, timidly watching her daughter who<br>walked up and down the room with her arms folded, lost in thought.<br>This walking up and down when she was thinking was a habit of Avdotya<br>Romanovna’s and the mother was always afraid to break in on her<br>daughter’s mood at such moments.<br><br>Razumihin, of course, was ridiculous in his sudden drunken infatuation<br>for Avdotya Romanovna. Yet apart from his eccentric condition, many<br>people would have thought it justified if they had seen Avdotya<br>Romanovna, especially at that moment when she was walking to and<br>fro with folded arms, pensive and melancholy. Avdotya Romanovna was<br>remarkably good-looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned,<br>strong and self-reliant--the latter quality was apparent in every<br>gesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and<br>softness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but she<br>might be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, a<br>little lighter than her brother’s; there was a proud light in her almost<br>black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She was<br>pale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness<br>and vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected<br>a little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful<br>face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty<br>expression. Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;<br>but how well smiles, how well youthful, lighthearted, irresponsible,<br>laughter suited her face! It was natural enough that a warm, open,<br>simple-hearted, honest giant like Razumihin, who had never seen anyone<br>like her and was not quite sober at the time, should lose his head<br>immediately. Besides, as chance would have it, he saw Dounia for the<br>first time transfigured by her love for her brother and her joy at<br>meeting him. Afterwards he saw her lower lip quiver with indignation<br>at her brother’s insolent, cruel and ungrateful words--and his fate was<br>sealed.<br><br>He had spoken the truth, moreover, when he blurted out in his drunken<br>talk on the stairs that Praskovya Pavlovna, Raskolnikov’s eccentric<br>landlady, would be jealous of Pulcheria Alexandrovna as well as of<br>Avdotya Romanovna on his account. Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was<br>forty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she<br>looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the<br>case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure<br>sincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in parenthesis that to<br>preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age. Her<br>hair had begun to grow grey and thin, there had long been little crow’s<br>foot wrinkles round her eyes, her cheeks were hollow and sunken from<br>anxiety and grief, and yet it was a handsome face. She was Dounia<br>over again, twenty years older, but without the projecting underlip.<br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna was emotional, but not sentimental, timid and<br>yielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a<br>great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a<br>certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions<br>which nothing would induce her to cross.<br><br>Exactly twenty minutes after Razumihin’s departure, there came two<br>subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.<br><br>“I won’t come in, I haven’t time,” he hastened to say when the door was<br>opened. “He sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and God grant he may<br>sleep ten hours. Nastasya’s with him; I told her not to leave till I<br>came. Now I am fetching Zossimov, he will report to you and then you’d<br>better turn in; I can see you are too tired to do anything....”<br><br>And he ran off down the corridor.<br><br>“What a very competent and... devoted young man!” cried Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna exceedingly delighted.<br><br>“He seems a splendid person!” Avdotya Romanovna replied with some<br>warmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.<br><br>It was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor<br>and another knock at the door. Both women waited this time completely<br>relying on Razumihin’s promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing<br>Zossimov. Zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to<br>go to Raskolnikov’s, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest<br>suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated<br>condition. But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw<br>that they were really expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten<br>minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and<br>extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.<br>He did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the<br>slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two<br>ladies. Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya<br>Romanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and<br>addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. All this gave him<br>extraordinary inward satisfaction. He declared that he thought the<br>invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. According to his<br>observations the patient’s illness was due partly to his unfortunate<br>material surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also<br>a moral origin, “was, so to speak, the product of several material and<br>moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...<br>and so on.” Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his<br>words with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this<br>theme. On Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s anxiously and timidly inquiring as<br>to “some suspicion of insanity,” he replied with a composed and candid<br>smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient<br>had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,<br>was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but<br>that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in<br>delirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have<br>a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, “if only all<br>fresh shocks can be avoided,” he added significantly. Then he got up,<br>took leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm<br>gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna<br>spontaneously offered her hand to him. He went out exceedingly pleased<br>with his visit and still more so with himself.<br><br>“We’ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!” Razumihin said in conclusion,<br>following Zossimov out. “I’ll be with you to-morrow morning as early as<br>possible with my report.”<br><br>“That’s a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna,” remarked Zossimov,<br>almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.<br><br>“Fetching? You said fetching?” roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov<br>and seized him by the throat. “If you ever dare.... Do you understand?<br>Do you understand?” he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezing<br>him against the wall. “Do you hear?”<br><br>“Let me go, you drunken devil,” said Zossimov, struggling and when he<br>had let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw.<br>Razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.<br><br>“Of course, I am an ass,” he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, “but<br>still... you are another.”<br><br>“No, brother, not at all such another. I am not dreaming of any folly.”<br><br>They walked along in silence and only when they were close to<br>Raskolnikov’s lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable<br>anxiety.<br><br>“Listen,” he said, “you’re a first-rate fellow, but among your other<br>failings, you’re a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too. You<br>are a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, you’re getting fat<br>and lazy and can’t deny yourself anything--and I call that dirty because<br>it leads one straight into the dirt. You’ve let yourself get so slack<br>that I don’t know how it is you are still a good, even a devoted doctor.<br>You--a doctor--sleep on a feather bed and get up at night to your<br>patients! In another three or four years you won’t get up for your<br>patients... But hang it all, that’s not the point!... You are going<br>to spend to-night in the landlady’s flat here. (Hard work I’ve had to<br>persuade her!) And I’ll be in the kitchen. So here’s a chance for you to<br>get to know her better.... It’s not as you think! There’s not a trace of<br>anything of the sort, brother...!”<br><br>“But I don’t think!”<br><br>“Here you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a savage<br>virtue... and yet she’s sighing and melting like wax, simply melting!<br>Save me from her, by all that’s unholy! She’s most prepossessing... I’ll<br>repay you, I’ll do anything....”<br><br>Zossimov laughed more violently than ever.<br><br>“Well, you are smitten! But what am I to do with her?”<br><br>“It won’t be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you like to her,<br>as long as you sit by her and talk. You’re a doctor, too; try curing<br>her of something. I swear you won’t regret it. She has a piano, and you<br>know, I strum a little. I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: ‘I<br>shed hot tears.’ She likes the genuine article--and well, it all<br>began with that song; Now you’re a regular performer, a _maître_, a<br>Rubinstein.... I assure you, you won’t regret it!”<br><br>“But have you made her some promise? Something signed? A promise of<br>marriage, perhaps?”<br><br>“Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of the kind! Besides she is not<br>that sort at all.... Tchebarov tried that....”<br><br>“Well then, drop her!”<br><br>“But I can’t drop her like that!”<br><br>“Why can’t you?”<br><br>“Well, I can’t, that’s all about it! There’s an element of attraction<br>here, brother.”<br><br>“Then why have you fascinated her?”<br><br>“I haven’t fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly.<br>But she won’t care a straw whether it’s you or I, so long as somebody<br>sits beside her, sighing.... I can’t explain the position, brother...<br>look here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now... begin<br>teaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, I’m not joking, I’m<br>in earnest, it’ll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and sigh<br>for a whole year together. I talked to her once for two days at a time<br>about the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)--she<br>just sighed and perspired! And you mustn’t talk of love--she’s bashful<br>to hysterics--but just let her see you can’t tear yourself away--that’s<br>enough. It’s fearfully comfortable; you’re quite at home, you can<br>read, sit, lie about, write. You may even venture on a kiss, if you’re<br>careful.”<br><br>“But what do I want with her?”<br><br>“Ach, I can’t make you understand! You see, you are made for each other!<br>I have often been reminded of you!... You’ll come to it in the end! So<br>does it matter whether it’s sooner or later? There’s the feather-bed<br>element here, brother--ach! and not only that! There’s an attraction<br>here--here you have the end of the world, an anchorage, a quiet haven,<br>the navel of the earth, the three fishes that are the foundation of the<br>world, the essence of pancakes, of savoury fish-pies, of the evening<br>samovar, of soft sighs and warm shawls, and hot stoves to sleep on--as<br>snug as though you were dead, and yet you’re alive--the advantages<br>of both at once! Well, hang it, brother, what stuff I’m talking, it’s<br>bedtime! Listen. I sometimes wake up at night; so I’ll go in and look at<br>him. But there’s no need, it’s all right. Don’t you worry yourself,<br>yet if you like, you might just look in once, too. But if you notice<br>anything--delirium or fever--wake me at once. But there can’t be....”<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>Razumihin waked up next morning at eight o’clock, troubled and serious.<br>He found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.<br>He had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He<br>remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly<br>novel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression<br>unlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised<br>clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly<br>unattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and<br>he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties<br>bequeathed him by that “thrice accursed yesterday.”<br><br>The most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown<br>himself “base and mean,” not only because he had been drunk, but<br>because he had taken advantage of the young girl’s position to abuse<br>her _fiancé_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual<br>relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And<br>what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?<br>Who had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as<br>Avdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So there<br>must be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he know<br>the character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat... Foo! how<br>despicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk?<br>Such a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth, and the<br>truth had all come out, “that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse<br>and envious heart”! And would such a dream ever be permissible to<br>him, Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisy<br>braggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical<br>a juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and<br>suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had<br>said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of<br>Avdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist<br>down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the<br>bricks flying.<br><br>“Of course,” he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of<br>self-abasement, “of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or<br>smoothed over... and so it’s useless even to think of it, and I must<br>go to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask<br>forgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!”<br><br>And yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual.<br>He hadn’t another suit--if he had had, perhaps he wouldn’t have put it<br>on. “I would have made a point of not putting it on.” But in any case he<br>could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend<br>the feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his<br>assistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his clothes carefully.<br>His linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.<br><br>He washed that morning scrupulously--he got some soap from Nastasya--he<br>washed his hair, his neck and especially his hands. When it came to the<br>question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna<br>had capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question<br>was angrily answered in the negative. “Let it stay as it is! What if<br>they think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would think<br>so! Not on any account!”<br><br>“And... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the<br>manners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had<br>some of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be<br>proud of? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all<br>the same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactly<br>dishonest, and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to<br>set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it! Well, he’d<br>make a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he<br>wouldn’t care! He’d be worse!”<br><br>He was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night<br>in Praskovya Pavlovna’s parlour, came in.<br><br>He was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first.<br>Razumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse.<br>Zossimov gave orders that they shouldn’t wake him and promised to see<br>him again about eleven.<br><br>“If he is still at home,” he added. “Damn it all! If one can’t control<br>one’s patients, how is one to cure them? Do you know whether _he_ will<br>go to them, or whether _they_ are coming here?”<br><br>“They are coming, I think,” said Razumihin, understanding the object<br>of the question, “and they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt.<br>I’ll be off. You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I.”<br><br>“But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I’ve plenty<br>to do besides looking after them.”<br><br>“One thing worries me,” interposed Razumihin, frowning. “On the way home<br>I talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and<br>amongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane.”<br><br>“You told the ladies so, too.”<br><br>“I know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did you think so<br>seriously?”<br><br>“That’s nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously? You,<br>yourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to<br>him... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with<br>your story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was,<br>perhaps, mad on that very point! If only I’d known what happened then<br>at the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with this<br>suspicion! Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday.<br>These monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and<br>see their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember, it was<br>Zametov’s story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, I<br>know one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat<br>of a little boy of eight, because he couldn’t endure the jokes he made<br>every day at table! And in this case his rags, the insolent police<br>officer, the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man half<br>frantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That<br>may well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it<br>all!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but<br>hm... he shouldn’t have told all that last night. He is an awful<br>chatterbox!”<br><br>“But whom did he tell it to? You and me?”<br><br>“And Porfiry.”<br><br>“What does that matter?”<br><br>“And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister?<br>Tell them to be more careful with him to-day....”<br><br>“They’ll get on all right!” Razumihin answered reluctantly.<br><br>“Why is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money and she doesn’t<br>seem to dislike him... and they haven’t a farthing, I suppose? eh?”<br><br>“But what business is it of yours?” Razumihin cried with annoyance. “How<br>can I tell whether they’ve a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhaps<br>you’ll find out....”<br><br>“Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night’s wine has not gone off<br>yet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night’s<br>lodging. She locked herself in, made no reply to my _bonjour_ through<br>the door; she was up at seven o’clock, the samovar was taken into her<br>from the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview....”<br><br>At nine o’clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev’s<br>house. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. They<br>had risen at seven o’clock or earlier. He entered looking as black as<br>night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He<br>had reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at<br>him, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glanced<br>timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that<br>moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such<br>complete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and<br>ill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater<br>confusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a<br>subject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.<br><br>Hearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked,<br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because<br>“she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over<br>beforehand.” Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation<br>to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya<br>Romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and<br>they asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such<br>a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihin<br>vigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped<br>in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s<br>questions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.<br><br>He talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted<br>by their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the<br>most important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov’s life,<br>concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted,<br>however, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at<br>the police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly<br>to his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his<br>listeners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.<br><br>“Tell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still don’t know<br>your name!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.<br><br>“Dmitri Prokofitch.”<br><br>“I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he<br>looks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are<br>his likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me, if you can,<br>what are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams? Under what influences is<br>he now? In a word, I should like...”<br><br>“Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?” observed Dounia.<br><br>“Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this,<br>Dmitri Prokofitch!”<br><br>“Naturally,” answered Razumihin. “I have no mother, but my uncle comes<br>every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in<br>appearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years’ separation<br>means a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for<br>a year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of<br>late--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and<br>fanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like<br>showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his<br>heart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply<br>cold and inhumanly callous; it’s as though he were alternating between<br>two characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is<br>so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing<br>nothing. He doesn’t jeer at things, not because he hasn’t the wit, but<br>as though he hadn’t time to waste on such trifles. He never listens<br>to what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other<br>people at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps<br>he is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most<br>beneficial influence upon him.”<br><br>“God grant it may,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by<br>Razumihin’s account of her Rodya.<br><br>And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.<br>He glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and<br>looked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening<br>attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her<br>arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,<br>without stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to<br>what was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a<br>white transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of<br>extreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed<br>like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps<br>just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery<br>of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be<br>afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very<br>trying for a man who already felt diffident.<br><br>“You’ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother’s<br>character... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you<br>were too uncritically devoted to him,” observed Avdotya Romanovna with<br>a smile. “I think you are right that he needs a woman’s care,” she added<br>thoughtfully.<br><br>“I didn’t say so; but I daresay you are right, only...”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>“He loves no one and perhaps he never will,” Razumihin declared<br>decisively.<br><br>“You mean he is not capable of love?”<br><br>“Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in<br>everything, indeed!” he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but<br>remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother,<br>he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya<br>Romanovna couldn’t help laughing when she looked at him.<br><br>“You may both be mistaken about Rodya,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked,<br>slightly piqued. “I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia.<br>What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have<br>supposed may be mistaken, but you can’t imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how<br>moody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could depend on what<br>he would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might<br>do something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for<br>instance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave<br>me a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that<br>girl--what was her name--his landlady’s daughter?”<br><br>“Did you hear about that affair?” asked Avdotya Romanovna.<br><br>“Do you suppose----” Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. “Do you<br>suppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from<br>grief, our poverty would have made him pause? No, he would calmly have<br>disregarded all obstacles. And yet it isn’t that he doesn’t love us!”<br><br>“He has never spoken a word of that affair to me,” Razumihin answered<br>cautiously. “But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,<br>though she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was<br>rather strange.”<br><br>“And what did you hear?” both the ladies asked at once.<br><br>“Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage, which<br>only failed to take place through the girl’s death, was not at all to<br>Praskovya Pavlovna’s liking. They say, too, the girl was not at all<br>pretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and<br>queer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have<br>had some good qualities or it’s quite inexplicable.... She had no money<br>either and he wouldn’t have considered her money.... But it’s always<br>difficult to judge in such matters.”<br><br>“I am sure she was a good girl,” Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.<br><br>“God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I don’t know<br>which of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her<br>or she to him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began<br>tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with<br>Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to<br>the latter’s annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently<br>caused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in<br>detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly<br>blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not<br>seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.<br><br>“He had planned it before his illness,” he added.<br><br>“I think so, too,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.<br>But she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself<br>so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.<br>Avdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it.<br><br>“So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna<br>could not resist asking.<br><br>“I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,”<br> Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, “and I don’t say it simply<br>from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna<br>has of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so<br>rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...<br>mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this<br>morning I am ashamed of it.”<br><br>He crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not<br>break the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they began<br>to speak of Luzhin.<br><br>Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what<br>to do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she<br>confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.<br><br>“You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,” she began. “I’ll be perfectly open with<br>Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?”<br><br>“Of course, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.<br><br>“This is what it is,” she began in haste, as though the permission to<br>speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. “Very early this<br>morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter<br>announcing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you<br>know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these<br>lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would<br>be here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him.<br>You’d better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me<br>very much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid<br>opinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya’s character better than<br>anyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia, I must tell<br>you, made her decision at once, but I still don’t feel sure how to act<br>and I... I’ve been waiting for your opinion.”<br><br>Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read<br>as follows:<br><br>“Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you<br>that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at<br>the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object<br>in view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with<br>you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of<br>delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you<br>are meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have<br>the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings<br>not later than to-morrow evening at eight o’clock precisely, and<br>herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative<br>request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as<br>he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my<br>visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire<br>from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation<br>upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own<br>interpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,<br>that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be<br>compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to<br>blame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so<br>ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able<br>to leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief<br>by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who<br>was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of<br>notorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the<br>funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to<br>raise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable<br>daughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage<br>of<br><br>“Your humble servant,<br><br>“P. LUZHIN.”<br><br><br>“What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?” began Pulcheria Alexandrovna,<br>almost weeping. “How can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted<br>so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not<br>to receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will<br>happen then?”<br><br>“Act on Avdotya Romanovna’s decision,” Razumihin answered calmly at<br>once.<br><br>“Oh, dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn’t<br>explain her object! She says that it would be best, at least, not that<br>it would be best, but that it’s absolutely necessary that Rodya should<br>make a point of being here at eight o’clock and that they must meet....<br>I didn’t want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him<br>from coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so<br>irritable.... Besides I don’t understand about that drunkard who died<br>and that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the<br>money... which...”<br><br>“Which cost you such sacrifice, mother,” put in Avdotya Romanovna.<br><br>“He was not himself yesterday,” Razumihin said thoughtfully, “if you<br>only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there<br>was sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as we were going home<br>yesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn’t understand<br>a word.... But last night, I myself...”<br><br>“The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves and<br>there I assure you we shall see at once what’s to be done. Besides,<br>it’s getting late--good heavens, it’s past ten,” she cried looking at<br>a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin<br>Venetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her<br>dress. “A present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin.<br><br>“We must start, Dounia, we must start,” her mother cried in a flutter.<br>“He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming<br>so late. Merciful heavens!”<br><br>While she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle;<br>Dounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were<br>not merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty<br>gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in<br>people who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently<br>at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. “The queen who mended her<br>stockings in prison,” he thought, “must have looked then every inch a<br>queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées.”<br><br>“My God!” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “little did I think that I<br>should ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya! I am afraid,<br>Dmitri Prokofitch,” she added, glancing at him timidly.<br><br>“Don’t be afraid, mother,” said Dounia, kissing her, “better have faith<br>in him.”<br><br>“Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven’t slept all night,”<br> exclaimed the poor woman.<br><br>They came out into the street.<br><br>“Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of<br>Marfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, took<br>my hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were<br>blaming me.... Is that a good omen? Oh, dear me! You don’t know, Dmitri<br>Prokofitch, that Marfa Petrovna’s dead!”<br><br>“No, I didn’t know; who is Marfa Petrovna?”<br><br>“She died suddenly; and only fancy...”<br><br>“Afterwards, mamma,” put in Dounia. “He doesn’t know who Marfa Petrovna<br>is.”<br><br>“Ah, you don’t know? And I was thinking that you knew all about us.<br>Forgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don’t know what I am thinking about<br>these last few days. I look upon you really as a providence for us, and<br>so I took it for granted that you knew all about us. I look on you as a<br>relation.... Don’t be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, what’s the<br>matter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?”<br><br>“Yes, I bruised it,” muttered Razumihin overjoyed.<br><br>“I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds fault<br>with me.... But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whether<br>he is awake? Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room? Listen,<br>you say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy<br>him with my... weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to<br>treat him? I feel quite distracted, you know.”<br><br>“Don’t question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don’t<br>ask him too much about his health; he doesn’t like that.”<br><br>“Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But here are the<br>stairs.... What an awful staircase!”<br><br>“Mother, you are quite pale, don’t distress yourself, darling,” said<br>Dounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: “He ought to be<br>happy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so.”<br><br>“Wait, I’ll peep in and see whether he has waked up.”<br><br>The ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they<br>reached the landlady’s door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her<br>door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching<br>them from the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door was<br>suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried<br>out.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>“He is well, quite well!” Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.<br><br>He had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place<br>as before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,<br>fully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for<br>some time past. The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed<br>to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.<br><br>Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the<br>day before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked like<br>a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.<br>His brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke<br>little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a<br>restlessness in his movements.<br><br>He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete<br>the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The<br>pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister<br>entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in<br>place of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look<br>of suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient<br>with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed<br>in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of<br>bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable<br>torture. He saw later that almost every word of the following<br>conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But<br>at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself<br>and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a<br>monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.<br><br>“Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well,” said Raskolnikov,<br>giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna radiant at once. “And I don’t say this _as I did<br>yesterday_,” he said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of<br>his hand.<br><br>“Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day,” began Zossimov, much<br>delighted at the ladies’ entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping<br>up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. “In another three or<br>four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,<br>as he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been<br>coming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been<br>perhaps your own fault?” he added, with a tentative smile, as though<br>still afraid of irritating him.<br><br>“It is very possible,” answered Raskolnikov coldly.<br><br>“I should say, too,” continued Zossimov with zest, “that your complete<br>recovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you,<br>I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the<br>elementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your<br>morbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go<br>from bad to worse. These fundamental causes I don’t know, but they must<br>be known to you. You are an intelligent man, and must have observed<br>yourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement<br>coincides with your leaving the university. You must not be left without<br>occupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I<br>fancy, be very beneficial.”<br><br>“Yes, yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return to<br>the university: and then everything will go smoothly....”<br><br>Zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before<br>the ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his<br>patient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. This lasted<br>an instant, however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking<br>Zossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.<br><br>“What! he saw you last night?” Raskolnikov asked, as though startled.<br>“Then you have not slept either after your journey.”<br><br>“Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o’clock. Dounia and I never go to<br>bed before two at home.”<br><br>“I don’t know how to thank him either,” Raskolnikov went on,<br>suddenly frowning and looking down. “Setting aside the question of<br>payment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I<br>really don’t know what I have done to deserve such special attention<br>from you! I simply don’t understand it... and... and... it weighs upon<br>me, indeed, because I don’t understand it. I tell you so candidly.”<br><br>“Don’t be irritated.” Zossimov forced himself to laugh. “Assume that you<br>are my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love<br>our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in<br>love with them. And, of course, I am not rich in patients.”<br><br>“I say nothing about him,” added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin,<br>“though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble.”<br><br>“What nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day,<br>are you?” shouted Razumihin.<br><br>If he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no<br>trace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.<br>But Avdotya Romanovna noticed it. She was intently and uneasily watching<br>her brother.<br><br>“As for you, mother, I don’t dare to speak,” he went on, as though<br>repeating a lesson learned by heart. “It is only to-day that I have<br>been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here<br>yesterday, waiting for me to come back.”<br><br>When he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister,<br>smiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real<br>unfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his<br>hand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had addressed her<br>since their dispute the previous day. The mother’s face lighted up<br>with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken<br>reconciliation. “Yes, that is what I love him for,” Razumihin,<br>exaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his<br>chair. “He has these movements.”<br><br>“And how well he does it all,” the mother was thinking to herself. “What<br>generous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end<br>to all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his<br>hand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And what<br>fine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!... He is even better<br>looking than Dounia.... But, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly<br>he’s dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch’s shop, is<br>better dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but<br>I am afraid.... Oh, dear, he’s so strange! He’s talking kindly, but I’m<br>afraid! Why, what am I afraid of?...”<br><br>“Oh, Rodya, you wouldn’t believe,” she began suddenly, in haste to<br>answer his words to her, “how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now<br>that it’s all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can<br>tell you. Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace<br>you and that woman--ah, here she is! Good morning, Nastasya!... She told<br>us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away<br>from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the<br>streets. You can’t imagine how we felt! I couldn’t help thinking of the<br>tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father’s--you<br>can’t remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever<br>and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn’t pull him out<br>till next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of<br>rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were<br>alone, utterly alone,” she said plaintively and stopped short,<br>suddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr<br>Petrovitch, although “we are quite happy again.”<br><br>“Yes, yes.... Of course it’s very annoying....” Raskolnikov muttered in<br>reply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed<br>at him in perplexity.<br><br>“What else was it I wanted to say?” He went on trying to recollect. “Oh,<br>yes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please don’t think that I didn’t mean<br>to come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first.”<br><br>“What are you saying, Rodya?” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She, too,<br>was surprised.<br><br>“Is he answering us as a duty?” Dounia wondered. “Is he being reconciled<br>and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating<br>a lesson?”<br><br>“I’ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing<br>to my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash out<br>the blood... I’ve only just dressed.”<br><br>“Blood! What blood?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm.<br><br>“Oh, nothing--don’t be uneasy. It was when I was wandering about<br>yesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run<br>over... a clerk...”<br><br>“Delirious? But you remember everything!” Razumihin interrupted.<br><br>“That’s true,” Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. “I<br>remember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why I did<br>that and went there and said that, I can’t clearly explain now.”<br><br>“A familiar phenomenon,” interposed Zossimov, “actions are sometimes<br>performed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the<br>actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it’s<br>like a dream.”<br><br>“Perhaps it’s a good thing really that he should think me almost a<br>madman,” thought Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too,” observed<br>Dounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.<br><br>“There is some truth in your observation,” the latter replied. “In that<br>sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the<br>slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we<br>must draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among<br>dozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with.”<br><br>At the word “madman,” carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on<br>his favourite subject, everyone frowned.<br><br>Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a<br>strange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.<br><br>“Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!”<br> Razumihin cried hastily.<br><br>“What?” Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. “Oh... I got spattered with<br>blood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did an<br>unpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave<br>away all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. She’s<br>a widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children,<br>starving... nothing in the house... there’s a daughter, too... perhaps<br>you’d have given it yourself if you’d seen them. But I had no right to<br>do it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.<br>To help others one must have the right to do it, or else _Crevez,<br>chiens, si vous n’êtes pas contents_.” He laughed, “That’s right, isn’t<br>it, Dounia?”<br><br>“No, it’s not,” answered Dounia firmly.<br><br>“Bah! you, too, have ideals,” he muttered, looking at her almost with<br>hatred, and smiling sarcastically. “I ought to have considered that....<br>Well, that’s praiseworthy, and it’s better for you... and if you reach a<br>line you won’t overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,<br>maybe you will be still unhappier.... But all that’s nonsense,” he added<br>irritably, vexed at being carried away. “I only meant to say that I beg<br>your forgiveness, mother,” he concluded, shortly and abruptly.<br><br>“That’s enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,”<br> said his mother, delighted.<br><br>“Don’t be too sure,” he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.<br><br>A silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all this<br>conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the<br>forgiveness, and all were feeling it.<br><br>“It is as though they were afraid of me,” Raskolnikov was thinking<br>to himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.<br><br>“Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much,” flashed through<br>his mind.<br><br>“Do you know, Rodya, Marfa Petrovna is dead,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna<br>suddenly blurted out.<br><br>“What Marfa Petrovna?”<br><br>“Oh, mercy on us--Marfa Petrovna Svidrigaïlov. I wrote you so much about<br>her.”<br><br>“A-a-h! Yes, I remember.... So she’s dead! Oh, really?” he roused<br>himself suddenly, as if waking up. “What did she die of?”<br><br>“Only imagine, quite suddenly,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered<br>hurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. “On the very day I was sending<br>you that letter! Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been<br>the cause of her death. They say he beat her dreadfully.”<br><br>“Why, were they on such bad terms?” he asked, addressing his sister.<br><br>“Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was always very<br>patient, considerate even. In fact, all those seven years of their<br>married life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases. All<br>of a sudden he seems to have lost patience.”<br><br>“Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven<br>years? You seem to be defending him, Dounia?”<br><br>“No, no, he’s an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful!” Dounia<br>answered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into<br>thought.<br><br>“That had happened in the morning,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on<br>hurriedly. “And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be<br>harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always used<br>to drive to the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am<br>told....”<br><br>“After the beating?”<br><br>“That was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not<br>to be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she was<br>undergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there, and<br>she used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got<br>into the water when she suddenly had a stroke!”<br><br>“I should think so,” said Zossimov.<br><br>“And did he beat her badly?”<br><br>“What does that matter!” put in Dounia.<br><br>“H’m! But I don’t know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,”<br> said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.<br><br>“Ah, my dear, I don’t know what to talk about,” broke from Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna.<br><br>“Why, are you all afraid of me?” he asked, with a constrained smile.<br><br>“That’s certainly true,” said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at<br>her brother. “Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the<br>stairs.”<br><br>His face worked, as though in convulsion.<br><br>“Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don’t be angry, please, Rodya....<br>Why did you say that, Dounia?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began,<br>overwhelmed--“You see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the<br>train, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything<br>together.... And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey! But what<br>am I saying? I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia.... I am happy<br>now--simply in seeing you, Rodya....”<br><br>“Hush, mother,” he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but<br>pressing her hand. “We shall have time to speak freely of everything!”<br><br>As he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned<br>pale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly<br>chill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to<br>him that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be<br>able to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to<br>_speak_ of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such that<br>for a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and not<br>looking at anyone walked towards the door.<br><br>“What are you about?” cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm.<br><br>He sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. They were<br>all looking at him in perplexity.<br><br>“But what are you all so dull for?” he shouted, suddenly and quite<br>unexpectedly. “Do say something! What’s the use of sitting like this?<br>Come, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....<br>Come, anything!”<br><br>“Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning<br>again,” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.<br><br>“What is the matter, Rodya?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully.<br><br>“Oh, nothing! I remembered something,” he answered, and suddenly<br>laughed.<br><br>“Well, if you remembered something; that’s all right!... I was beginning<br>to think...” muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa. “It is time<br>for me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can...” He made<br>his bows, and went out.<br><br>“What an excellent man!” observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.<br><br>“Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,” Raskolnikov<br>began, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he<br>had not shown till then. “I can’t remember where I met him before my<br>illness.... I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a good<br>man, too,” he nodded at Razumihin. “Do you like him, Dounia?” he asked<br>her; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.<br><br>“Very much,” answered Dounia.<br><br>“Foo!--what a pig you are!” Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible<br>confusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled<br>faintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.<br><br>“Where are you off to?”<br><br>“I must go.”<br><br>“You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don’t go.<br>What’s the time? Is it twelve o’clock? What a pretty watch you have got,<br>Dounia. But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking.”<br><br>“It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,” answered Dounia.<br><br>“And a very expensive one!” added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.<br><br>“A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady’s.”<br><br>“I like that sort,” said Dounia.<br><br>“So it is not a present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin, and was<br>unreasonably delighted.<br><br>“I thought it was Luzhin’s present,” observed Raskolnikov.<br><br>“No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.”<br><br>“A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get<br>married?” he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted<br>by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.<br><br>“Oh, yes, my dear.”<br><br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.<br><br>“H’m, yes. What shall I tell you? I don’t remember much indeed. She was<br>such a sickly girl,” he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again.<br>“Quite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was<br>always dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she<br>began talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember very<br>well. She was an ugly little thing. I really don’t know what drew me<br>to her then--I think it was because she was always ill. If she had been<br>lame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still,” he<br>smiled dreamily. “Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium.”<br><br>“No, it was not only spring delirium,” said Dounia, with warm feeling.<br><br>He fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did<br>not understand her words. Then, completely lost in thought, he got up,<br>went up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.<br><br>“You love her even now?” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched.<br><br>“Her? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No... that’s all now, as<br>it were, in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everything<br>happening here seems somehow far away.” He looked attentively at them.<br>“You, now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...<br>but, goodness knows why we are talking of that! And what’s the use of<br>asking about it?” he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell<br>into dreamy silence again.<br><br>“What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It’s like a tomb,” said<br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. “I<br>am sure it’s quite half through your lodging you have become so<br>melancholy.”<br><br>“My lodging,” he answered, listlessly. “Yes, the lodging had a great<br>deal to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though,<br>what a strange thing you said just now, mother,” he said, laughing<br>strangely.<br><br>A little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister,<br>with him after three years’ absence, this intimate tone of conversation,<br>in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,<br>would have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent<br>matter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had<br>decided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of<br>escape.<br><br>“Listen, Dounia,” he began, gravely and drily, “of course I beg your<br>pardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that<br>I do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a<br>scoundrel, you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease<br>at once to look on you as a sister.”<br><br>“Rodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again,” Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna cried, mournfully. “And why do you call yourself a<br>scoundrel? I can’t bear it. You said the same yesterday.”<br><br>“Brother,” Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. “In all<br>this there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night,<br>and found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am<br>sacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at<br>all. I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for<br>me. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to<br>my family. But that is not the chief motive for my decision....”<br><br>“She is lying,” he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively.<br>“Proud creature! She won’t admit she wants to do it out of charity! Too<br>haughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh,<br>how I... hate them all!”<br><br>“In fact,” continued Dounia, “I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of<br>two evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects of<br>me, so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now?” She, too,<br>flushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.<br><br>“All?” he asked, with a malignant grin.<br><br>“Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch’s<br>courtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may, of course, think too<br>well of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing<br>again?”<br><br>“And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are<br>intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your<br>own against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked<br>with him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you<br>are acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.”<br><br>“It is not true. I am not lying,” cried Dounia, losing her composure.<br>“I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me<br>and thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly<br>convinced that I can respect him. Fortunately, I can have convincing<br>proof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as<br>you say! And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a<br>vile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?<br>Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It<br>is despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone, it is only myself.... I<br>am not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are you<br>so pale? Rodya, darling, what’s the matter?”<br><br>“Good heavens! You have made him faint,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.<br><br>“No, no, nonsense! It’s nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. You<br>have fainting on the brain. H’m, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. In<br>what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,<br>and that he... esteems you, as you said. I think you said to-day?”<br><br>“Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch’s letter,” said Dounia.<br><br>With trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. He<br>took it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked<br>with a sort of wonder at Dounia.<br><br>“It is strange,” he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. “What<br>am I making such a fuss for? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!”<br><br>He said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for<br>some time at his sister, as though puzzled. He opened the letter at<br>last, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then,<br>slowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.<br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected<br>something particular.<br><br>“What surprises me,” he began, after a short pause, handing the letter<br>to his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, “is that he is a<br>business man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and<br>yet he writes such an uneducated letter.”<br><br>They all started. They had expected something quite different.<br><br>“But they all write like that, you know,” Razumihin observed, abruptly.<br><br>“Have you read it?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“We showed him, Rodya. We... consulted him just now,” Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna began, embarrassed.<br><br>“That’s just the jargon of the courts,” Razumihin put in. “Legal<br>documents are written like that to this day.”<br><br>“Legal? Yes, it’s just legal--business language--not so very uneducated,<br>and not quite educated--business language!”<br><br>“Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap<br>education, he is proud indeed of having made his own way,” Avdotya<br>Romanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother’s tone.<br><br>“Well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, I don’t deny it. You seem to<br>be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the<br>letter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to<br>annoy you. It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style<br>occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There<br>is one expression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in very significantly and<br>plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I<br>am present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon<br>you both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning<br>you to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such an<br>expression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had<br>written it, or Zossimov, or one of us?”<br><br>“N-no,” answered Dounia, with more animation. “I saw clearly that it<br>was too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill<br>in writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect,<br>indeed...”<br><br>“It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he<br>intended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression<br>in the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. I<br>gave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed<br>with trouble, and not ‘on the pretext of the funeral,’ but simply to pay<br>for the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes,<br>of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my<br>life)--but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander<br>me and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legal<br>jargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and<br>with a very naïve eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act<br>sensibly, intelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and... I<br>don’t think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to<br>warn you, because I sincerely wish for your good...”<br><br>Dounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was only<br>awaiting the evening.<br><br>“Then what is your decision, Rodya?” asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who<br>was more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his<br>talk.<br><br>“What decision?”<br><br>“You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this<br>evening, and that he will go away if you come. So will you... come?”<br><br>“That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are<br>not offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is<br>not offended. I will do what you think best,” he added, drily.<br><br>“Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her,” Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna hastened to declare.<br><br>“I decided to ask you, Rodya, to urge you not to fail to be with us at<br>this interview,” said Dounia. “Will you come?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“I will ask you, too, to be with us at eight o’clock,” she said,<br>addressing Razumihin. “Mother, I am inviting him, too.”<br><br>“Quite right, Dounia. Well, since you have decided,” added Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna, “so be it. I shall feel easier myself. I do not like<br>concealment and deception. Better let us have the whole truth.... Pyotr<br>Petrovitch may be angry or not, now!”<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>At that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into<br>the room, looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her with<br>surprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise<br>her. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday for<br>the first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such<br>a dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now she<br>was a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed,<br>almost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but<br>somewhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indoor<br>dress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a<br>parasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so<br>much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a<br>little child. She was even about to retreat. “Oh... it’s you!” said<br>Raskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once<br>recollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin’s letter<br>of “some young woman of notorious behaviour.” He had only just been<br>protesting against Luzhin’s calumny and declaring that he had seen the<br>girl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in. He<br>remembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression “of<br>notorious behaviour.” All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through<br>his brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated<br>creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she<br>made a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.<br><br>“I did not expect you,” he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her<br>stop. “Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.<br>Allow me--not there. Sit here....”<br><br>At Sonia’s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of<br>Raskolnikov’s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to<br>enter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where<br>Zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him<br>as a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her to<br>Razumihin’s chair.<br><br>“You sit here,” he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa.<br><br>Sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the<br>two ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she<br>could sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightened<br>that she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed<br>Raskolnikov.<br><br>“I... I... have come for one minute. Forgive me for disturbing you,” she<br>began falteringly. “I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to<br>send. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in<br>the morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...<br>to do her the honour... she told me to beg you...” Sonia stammered and<br>ceased speaking.<br><br>“I will try, certainly, most certainly,” answered Raskolnikov. He,<br>too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence.<br>“Please sit down,” he said, suddenly. “I want to talk to you. You are<br>perhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,” and<br>he drew up a chair for her.<br><br>Sonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened<br>look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov’s pale face<br>flushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.<br><br>“Mother,” he said, firmly and insistently, “this is Sofya Semyonovna<br>Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run<br>over yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.”<br><br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up<br>her eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya’s urgent and<br>challenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction. Dounia<br>gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl’s face, and scrutinised<br>her with perplexity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise<br>her eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.<br><br>“I wanted to ask you,” said Raskolnikov, hastily, “how things were<br>arranged yesterday. You were not worried by the police, for instance?”<br><br>“No, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death...<br>they did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry.”<br><br>“Why?”<br><br>“At the body’s remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that,<br>to-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until<br>to-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees<br>herself that it’s necessary...”<br><br>“To-day, then?”<br><br>“She begs you to do us the honour to be in the church to-morrow for the<br>service, and then to be present at the funeral lunch.”<br><br>“She is giving a funeral lunch?”<br><br>“Yes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helping<br>us yesterday. But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral.”<br><br>All at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she<br>controlled herself, looking down again.<br><br>During the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had a<br>thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a<br>sharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty, but<br>her blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such<br>a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help<br>being attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another<br>peculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen years, she looked<br>almost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her gestures, this<br>childishness seemed almost absurd.<br><br>“But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?<br>Does she even mean to have a funeral lunch?” Raskolnikov asked,<br>persistently keeping up the conversation.<br><br>“The coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so<br>it won’t cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, so<br>that there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious<br>it should be so. You know one can’t... it’s a comfort to her... she is<br>like that, you know....”<br><br>“I understand, I understand... of course... why do you look at my room<br>like that? My mother has just said it is like a tomb.”<br><br>“You gave us everything yesterday,” Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a<br>loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. Her lips<br>and chin were trembling once more. She had been struck at once<br>by Raskolnikov’s poor surroundings, and now these words broke out<br>spontaneously. A silence followed. There was a light in Dounia’s eyes,<br>and even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.<br><br>“Rodya,” she said, getting up, “we shall have dinner together, of<br>course. Come, Dounia.... And you, Rodya, had better go for a little<br>walk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... I am<br>afraid we have exhausted you....”<br><br>“Yes, yes, I’ll come,” he answered, getting up fussily. “But I have<br>something to see to.”<br><br>“But surely you will have dinner together?” cried Razumihin, looking in<br>surprise at Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”<br><br>“Yes, yes, I am coming... of course, of course! And you stay a minute.<br>You do not want him just now, do you, mother? Or perhaps I am taking him<br>from you?”<br><br>“Oh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining<br>with us?”<br><br>“Please do,” added Dounia.<br><br>Razumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, they were all<br>strangely embarrassed.<br><br>“Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like saying good-bye.<br>Good-bye, Nastasya. Ah, I have said good-bye again.”<br><br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed<br>to come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.<br><br>But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother<br>out, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow. Sonia, in confusion, gave<br>a hurried, frightened curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfort<br>in her face, as though Avdotya Romanovna’s courtesy and attention were<br>oppressive and painful to her.<br><br>“Dounia, good-bye,” called Raskolnikov, in the passage. “Give me your<br>hand.”<br><br>“Why, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten?” said Dounia, turning<br>warmly and awkwardly to him.<br><br>“Never mind, give it to me again.” And he squeezed her fingers warmly.<br><br>Dounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy.<br><br>“Come, that’s capital,” he said to Sonia, going back and looking<br>brightly at her. “God give peace to the dead, the living have still to<br>live. That is right, isn’t it?”<br><br>Sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face. He looked<br>at her for some moments in silence. The whole history of the dead father<br>floated before his memory in those moments....<br><br>*****<br><br>“Heavens, Dounia,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they were in<br>the street, “I really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease.<br>How little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad<br>of that.”<br><br>“I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don’t you see it?<br>Perhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be patient, and much, much<br>can be forgiven.”<br><br>“Well, you were not very patient!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up,<br>hotly and jealously. “Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two. You<br>are the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul. You<br>are both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both<br>generous.... Surely he can’t be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? When I think of<br>what is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!”<br><br>“Don’t be uneasy, mother. What must be, will be.”<br><br>“Dounia, only think what a position we are in! What if Pyotr Petrovitch<br>breaks it off?” poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously.<br><br>“He won’t be worth much if he does,” answered Dounia, sharply and<br>contemptuously.<br><br>“We did well to come away,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in.<br>“He was in a hurry about some business or other. If he gets out and has<br>a breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room.... But where is<br>one to get a breath of air here? The very streets here feel like shut-up<br>rooms. Good heavens! what a town!... stay... this side... they will<br>crush you--carrying something. Why, it is a piano they have got, I<br>declare... how they push!... I am very much afraid of that young woman,<br>too.”<br><br>“What young woman, mother?<br><br>“Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now.”<br><br>“Why?”<br><br>“I have a presentiment, Dounia. Well, you may believe it or not, but<br>as soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt that she was the chief<br>cause of the trouble....”<br><br>“Nothing of the sort!” cried Dounia, in vexation. “What nonsense, with<br>your presentiments, mother! He only made her acquaintance the evening<br>before, and he did not know her when she came in.”<br><br>“Well, you will see.... She worries me; but you will see, you will<br>see! I was so frightened. She was gazing at me with those eyes. I could<br>scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do you<br>remember? It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that<br>about her, and he introduces her to us--to you! So he must think a great<br>deal of her.”<br><br>“People will write anything. We were talked about and written about,<br>too. Have you forgotten? I am sure that she is a good girl, and that it<br>is all nonsense.”<br><br>“God grant it may be!”<br><br>“And Pyotr Petrovitch is a contemptible slanderer,” Dounia snapped out,<br>suddenly.<br><br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna was crushed; the conversation was not resumed.<br><br>*****<br><br>“I will tell you what I want with you,” said Raskolnikov, drawing<br>Razumihin to the window.<br><br>“Then I will tell Katerina Ivanovna that you are coming,” Sonia said<br>hurriedly, preparing to depart.<br><br>“One minute, Sofya Semyonovna. We have no secrets. You are not in our<br>way. I want to have another word or two with you. Listen!” he turned<br>suddenly to Razumihin again. “You know that... what’s his name...<br>Porfiry Petrovitch?”<br><br>“I should think so! He is a relation. Why?” added the latter, with<br>interest.<br><br>“Is not he managing that case... you know, about that murder?... You<br>were speaking about it yesterday.”<br><br>“Yes... well?” Razumihin’s eyes opened wide.<br><br>“He was inquiring for people who had pawned things, and I have some<br>pledges there, too--trifles--a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when<br>I left home, and my father’s silver watch--they are only worth five or<br>six roubles altogether... but I value them. So what am I to do now? I<br>do not want to lose the things, especially the watch. I was quaking just<br>now, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia’s<br>watch. It is the only thing of father’s left us. She would be ill if<br>it were lost. You know what women are. So tell me what to do. I know I<br>ought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be<br>better to go straight to Porfiry? Eh? What do you think? The matter<br>might be settled more quickly. You see, mother may ask for it before<br>dinner.”<br><br>“Certainly not to the police station. Certainly to Porfiry,” Razumihin<br>shouted in extraordinary excitement. “Well, how glad I am. Let us go at<br>once. It is a couple of steps. We shall be sure to find him.”<br><br>“Very well, let us go.”<br><br>“And he will be very, very glad to make your acquaintance. I have<br>often talked to him of you at different times. I was speaking of you<br>yesterday. Let us go. So you knew the old woman? So that’s it! It is all<br>turning out splendidly.... Oh, yes, Sofya Ivanovna...”<br><br>“Sofya Semyonovna,” corrected Raskolnikov. “Sofya Semyonovna, this is my<br>friend Razumihin, and he is a good man.”<br><br>“If you have to go now,” Sonia was beginning, not looking at Razumihin<br>at all, and still more embarrassed.<br><br>“Let us go,” decided Raskolnikov. “I will come to you to-day, Sofya<br>Semyonovna. Only tell me where you live.”<br><br>He was not exactly ill at ease, but seemed hurried, and avoided her<br>eyes. Sonia gave her address, and flushed as she did so. They all went<br>out together.<br><br>“Don’t you lock up?” asked Razumihin, following him on to the stairs.<br><br>“Never,” answered Raskolnikov. “I have been meaning to buy a lock for<br>these two years. People are happy who have no need of locks,” he said,<br>laughing, to Sonia. They stood still in the gateway.<br><br>“Do you go to the right, Sofya Semyonovna? How did you find me, by the<br>way?” he added, as though he wanted to say something quite different. He<br>wanted to look at her soft clear eyes, but this was not easy.<br><br>“Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday.”<br><br>“Polenka? Oh, yes; Polenka, that is the little girl. She is your sister?<br>Did I give her the address?”<br><br>“Why, had you forgotten?”<br><br>“No, I remember.”<br><br>“I had heard my father speak of you... only I did not know your name,<br>and he did not know it. And now I came... and as I had learnt your name,<br>I asked to-day, ‘Where does Mr. Raskolnikov live?’ I did not know you<br>had only a room too.... Good-bye, I will tell Katerina Ivanovna.”<br><br>She was extremely glad to escape at last; she went away looking down,<br>hurrying to get out of sight as soon as possible, to walk the twenty<br>steps to the turning on the right and to be at last alone, and then<br>moving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to<br>remember, to meditate on every word, every detail. Never, never had she<br>felt anything like this. Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was<br>opening before her. She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to<br>come to her that day, perhaps at once!<br><br>“Only not to-day, please, not to-day!” she kept muttering with a sinking<br>heart, as though entreating someone, like a frightened child. “Mercy! to<br>me... to that room... he will see... oh, dear!”<br><br>She was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who<br>was watching her and following at her heels. He had accompanied her from<br>the gateway. At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood<br>still at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,<br>started on hearing Sonia’s words: “and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov<br>lived?” He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially<br>upon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted<br>the house. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not<br>to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for<br>something. He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and<br>that Sonia was going home.<br><br>“Home? Where? I’ve seen that face somewhere,” he thought. “I must find<br>out.”<br><br>At the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the<br>same way, noticing nothing. She turned the corner. He followed her on<br>the other side. After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook<br>her and kept two or three yards behind her.<br><br>He was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high<br>shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little. He wore<br>good and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.<br>He carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each<br>step; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant face<br>with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg.<br>His flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with<br>grey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.<br>His eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were<br>crimson. He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger<br>than his years.<br><br>When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on<br>the pavement. He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation. On reaching<br>the house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed<br>her, seeming rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the right<br>corner. “Bah!” muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs<br>behind her. Only then Sonia noticed him. She reached the third storey,<br>turned down the passage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed<br>in chalk, “Kapernaumov, Tailor.” “Bah!” the stranger repeated again,<br>wondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No. 8.<br>The doors were two or three yards apart.<br><br>“You lodge at Kapernaumov’s,” he said, looking at Sonia and laughing.<br>“He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am staying close here at<br>Madame Resslich’s. How odd!” Sonia looked at him attentively.<br><br>“We are neighbours,” he went on gaily. “I only came to town the day<br>before yesterday. Good-bye for the present.”<br><br>Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. She felt for<br>some reason ashamed and uneasy.<br><br>*****<br><br>On the way to Porfiry’s, Razumihin was obviously excited.<br><br>“That’s capital, brother,” he repeated several times, “and I am glad! I<br>am glad!”<br><br>“What are you glad about?” Raskolnikov thought to himself.<br><br>“I didn’t know that you pledged things at the old woman’s, too. And...<br>was it long ago? I mean, was it long since you were there?”<br><br>“What a simple-hearted fool he is!”<br><br>“When was it?” Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. “Two or three<br>days before her death it must have been. But I am not going to redeem<br>the things now,” he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous<br>solicitude about the things. “I’ve not more than a silver rouble<br>left... after last night’s accursed delirium!”<br><br>He laid special emphasis on the delirium.<br><br>“Yes, yes,” Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear. “Then<br>that’s why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you<br>were continually mentioning some rings or chains! Yes, yes... that’s<br>clear, it’s all clear now.”<br><br>“Hullo! How that idea must have got about among them. Here this man will<br>go to the stake for me, and I find him delighted at having it _cleared<br>up_ why I spoke of rings in my delirium! What a hold the idea must have<br>on all of them!”<br><br>“Shall we find him?” he asked suddenly.<br><br>“Oh, yes,” Razumihin answered quickly. “He is a nice fellow, you will<br>see, brother. Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished<br>manners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He is an intelligent<br>fellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... He<br>is incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, or<br>rather to make fun of them. His is the old, circumstantial method....<br>But he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up a<br>case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue. He is very, very<br>anxious to make your acquaintance!”<br><br>“On what grounds is he so anxious?”<br><br>“Oh, it’s not exactly... you see, since you’ve been ill I happen to have<br>mentioned you several times.... So, when he heard about you... about<br>your being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said,<br>‘What a pity!’ And so I concluded... from everything together, not only<br>that; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on<br>the way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk... I am afraid, brother,<br>of your exaggerating it, you see.”<br><br>“What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are right,” he said<br>with a constrained smile.<br><br>“Yes, yes.... That is, pooh, no!... But all that I said (and there was<br>something else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense.”<br><br>“But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all!” Raskolnikov cried<br>with exaggerated irritability. It was partly assumed, however.<br><br>“I know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. One’s ashamed<br>to speak of it.”<br><br>“If you are ashamed, then don’t speak of it.”<br><br>Both were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov<br>perceived it with repulsion. He was alarmed, too, by what Razumihin had<br>just said about Porfiry.<br><br>“I shall have to pull a long face with him too,” he thought, with a<br>beating heart, and he turned white, “and do it naturally, too. But the<br>most natural thing would be to do nothing at all. Carefully do nothing<br>at all! No, _carefully_ would not be natural again.... Oh, well, we<br>shall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly. Is it a good<br>thing to go or not? The butterfly flies to the light. My heart is<br>beating, that’s what’s bad!”<br><br>“In this grey house,” said Razumihin.<br><br>“The most important thing, does Porfiry know that I was at the old<br>hag’s flat yesterday... and asked about the blood? I must find that out<br>instantly, as soon as I go in, find out from his face; otherwise... I’ll<br>find out, if it’s my ruin.”<br><br>“I say, brother,” he said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, with a sly<br>smile, “I have been noticing all day that you seem to be curiously<br>excited. Isn’t it so?”<br><br>“Excited? Not a bit of it,” said Razumihin, stung to the quick.<br><br>“Yes, brother, I assure you it’s noticeable. Why, you sat on your chair<br>in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be<br>writhing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment you<br>were angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even<br>blushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed<br>awfully.”<br><br>“Nothing of the sort, nonsense! What do you mean?”<br><br>“But why are you wriggling out of it, like a schoolboy? By Jove, there<br>he’s blushing again.”<br><br>“What a pig you are!”<br><br>“But why are you so shamefaced about it? Romeo! Stay, I’ll tell of you<br>to-day. Ha-ha-ha! I’ll make mother laugh, and someone else, too...”<br><br>“Listen, listen, listen, this is serious.... What next, you fiend!”<br> Razumihin was utterly overwhelmed, turning cold with horror. “What will<br>you tell them? Come, brother... foo! what a pig you are!”<br><br>“You are like a summer rose. And if only you knew how it suits you; a<br>Romeo over six foot high! And how you’ve washed to-day--you cleaned your<br>nails, I declare. Eh? That’s something unheard of! Why, I do believe<br>you’ve got pomatum on your hair! Bend down.”<br><br>“Pig!”<br><br>Raskolnikov laughed as though he could not restrain himself. So<br>laughing, they entered Porfiry Petrovitch’s flat. This is what<br>Raskolnikov wanted: from within they could be heard laughing as they<br>came in, still guffawing in the passage.<br><br>“Not a word here or I’ll... brain you!” Razumihin whispered furiously,<br>seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>Raskolnikov was already entering the room. He came in looking as though<br>he had the utmost difficulty not to burst out laughing again. Behind him<br>Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony,<br>with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face and<br>whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified<br>Raskolnikov’s laughter. Raskolnikov, not waiting for an introduction,<br>bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room<br>looking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands, still<br>apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few<br>words to introduce himself. But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming<br>a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as<br>though accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself:<br>his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried<br>to restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received<br>this “spontaneous” mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most<br>genuine fun and naturalness. Razumihin strengthened this impression as<br>though on purpose.<br><br>“Fool! You fiend,” he roared, waving his arm which at once struck a<br>little round table with an empty tea-glass on it. Everything was sent<br>flying and crashing.<br><br>“But why break chairs, gentlemen? You know it’s a loss to the Crown,”<br> Porfiry Petrovitch quoted gaily.<br><br>Raskolnikov was still laughing, with his hand in Porfiry Petrovitch’s,<br>but anxious not to overdo it, awaited the right moment to put a natural<br>end to it. Razumihin, completely put to confusion by upsetting the table<br>and smashing the glass, gazed gloomily at the fragments, cursed and<br>turned sharply to the window where he stood looking out with his back<br>to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing.<br>Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but<br>obviously looked for explanations. Zametov had been sitting in the<br>corner, but he rose at the visitors’ entrance and was standing in<br>expectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and<br>even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a<br>certain embarrassment. Zametov’s unexpected presence struck Raskolnikov<br>unpleasantly.<br><br>“I’ve got to think of that,” he thought. “Excuse me, please,” he began,<br>affecting extreme embarrassment. “Raskolnikov.”<br><br>“Not at all, very pleasant to see you... and how pleasantly you’ve come<br>in.... Why, won’t he even say good-morning?” Porfiry Petrovitch nodded<br>at Razumihin.<br><br>“Upon my honour I don’t know why he is in such a rage with me. I only<br>told him as we came along that he was like Romeo... and proved it. And<br>that was all, I think!”<br><br>“Pig!” ejaculated Razumihin, without turning round.<br><br>“There must have been very grave grounds for it, if he is so furious at<br>the word,” Porfiry laughed.<br><br>“Oh, you sharp lawyer!... Damn you all!” snapped Razumihin, and suddenly<br>bursting out laughing himself, he went up to Porfiry with a more<br>cheerful face as though nothing had happened. “That’ll do! We are<br>all fools. To come to business. This is my friend Rodion Romanovitch<br>Raskolnikov; in the first place he has heard of you and wants to make<br>your acquaintance, and secondly, he has a little matter of business with<br>you. Bah! Zametov, what brought you here? Have you met before? Have you<br>known each other long?”<br><br>“What does this mean?” thought Raskolnikov uneasily.<br><br>Zametov seemed taken aback, but not very much so.<br><br>“Why, it was at your rooms we met yesterday,” he said easily.<br><br>“Then I have been spared the trouble. All last week he was begging me<br>to introduce him to you. Porfiry and you have sniffed each other out<br>without me. Where is your tobacco?”<br><br>Porfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and<br>trodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty, short,<br>stout even to corpulence, and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short<br>and had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. His<br>soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour,<br>but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have been<br>good-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery,<br>mawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes. The expression<br>of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish<br>figure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at<br>first sight.<br><br>As soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter<br>of business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down<br>himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with<br>that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and<br>embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are<br>discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such<br>exceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov<br>explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied<br>with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.<br>Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin,<br>sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently,<br>looking from one to the other every moment with rather excessive<br>interest.<br><br>“Fool,” Raskolnikov swore to himself.<br><br>“You have to give information to the police,” Porfiry replied, with a<br>most businesslike air, “that having learnt of this incident, that is of<br>the murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such<br>and such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them...<br>or... but they will write to you.”<br><br>“That’s just the point, that at the present moment,” Raskolnikov tried<br>his utmost to feign embarrassment, “I am not quite in funds... and<br>even this trifling sum is beyond me... I only wanted, you see, for<br>the present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have<br>money....”<br><br>“That’s no matter,” answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his<br>explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, “but you can, if you<br>prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the<br>matter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg...”<br><br>“On an ordinary sheet of paper?” Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again<br>interested in the financial side of the question.<br><br>“Oh, the most ordinary,” and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with<br>obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at<br>him. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov’s fancy, for it all lasted but a<br>moment. There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could<br>have sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.<br><br>“He knows,” flashed through his mind like lightning.<br><br>“Forgive my troubling you about such trifles,” he went on, a little<br>disconcerted, “the things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them<br>particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must<br>confess that I was alarmed when I heard...”<br><br>“That’s why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that<br>Porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!” Razumihin put in<br>with obvious intention.<br><br>This was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him<br>with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately<br>recollected himself.<br><br>“You seem to be jeering at me, brother?” he said to him, with a<br>well-feigned irritability. “I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious<br>about such trash; but you mustn’t think me selfish or grasping for that,<br>and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told you<br>just now that the silver watch, though it’s not worth a cent, is the<br>only thing left us of my father’s. You may laugh at me, but my mother is<br>here,” he turned suddenly to Porfiry, “and if she knew,” he turned again<br>hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, “that the<br>watch was lost, she would be in despair! You know what women are!”<br><br>“Not a bit of it! I didn’t mean that at all! Quite the contrary!”<br> shouted Razumihin distressed.<br><br>“Was it right? Was it natural? Did I overdo it?” Raskolnikov asked<br>himself in a tremor. “Why did I say that about women?”<br><br>“Oh, your mother is with you?” Porfiry Petrovitch inquired.<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“When did she come?”<br><br>“Last night.”<br><br>Porfiry paused as though reflecting.<br><br>“Your things would not in any case be lost,” he went on calmly and<br>coldly. “I have been expecting you here for some time.”<br><br>And as though that was a matter of no importance, he carefully offered<br>the ash-tray to Razumihin, who was ruthlessly scattering cigarette ash<br>over the carpet. Raskolnikov shuddered, but Porfiry did not seem to be<br>looking at him, and was still concerned with Razumihin’s cigarette.<br><br>“What? Expecting him? Why, did you know that he had pledges _there_?”<br> cried Razumihin.<br><br>Porfiry Petrovitch addressed himself to Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Your things, the ring and the watch, were wrapped up together, and on<br>the paper your name was legibly written in pencil, together with the<br>date on which you left them with her...”<br><br>“How observant you are!” Raskolnikov smiled awkwardly, doing his very<br>utmost to look him straight in the face, but he failed, and suddenly<br>added:<br><br>“I say that because I suppose there were a great many pledges... that it<br>must be difficult to remember them all.... But you remember them all so<br>clearly, and... and...”<br><br>“Stupid! Feeble!” he thought. “Why did I add that?”<br><br>“But we know all who had pledges, and you are the only one who hasn’t<br>come forward,” Porfiry answered with hardly perceptible irony.<br><br>“I haven’t been quite well.”<br><br>“I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress<br>about something. You look pale still.”<br><br>“I am not pale at all.... No, I am quite well,” Raskolnikov snapped<br>out rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger was<br>mounting, he could not repress it. “And in my anger I shall betray<br>myself,” flashed through his mind again. “Why are they torturing me?”<br><br>“Not quite well!” Razumihin caught him up. “What next! He was<br>unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, as<br>soon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand,<br>and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight,<br>delirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!”<br><br>“Really delirious? You don’t say so!” Porfiry shook his head in a<br>womanish way.<br><br>“Nonsense! Don’t you believe it! But you don’t believe it anyway,”<br> Raskolnikov let slip in his anger. But Porfiry Petrovitch did not seem<br>to catch those strange words.<br><br>“But how could you have gone out if you hadn’t been delirious?”<br> Razumihin got hot suddenly. “What did you go out for? What was the<br>object of it? And why on the sly? Were you in your senses when you did<br>it? Now that all danger is over I can speak plainly.”<br><br>“I was awfully sick of them yesterday.” Raskolnikov addressed Porfiry<br>suddenly with a smile of insolent defiance, “I ran away from them to<br>take lodgings where they wouldn’t find me, and took a lot of money with<br>me. Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or<br>delirious yesterday; settle our dispute.”<br><br>He could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his<br>expression and his silence to him.<br><br>“In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were<br>extremely irritable,” Zametov pronounced dryly.<br><br>“And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day,” put in Porfiry Petrovitch,<br>“that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had<br>been run over.”<br><br>“And there,” said Razumihin, “weren’t you mad then? You gave your last<br>penny to the widow for the funeral. If you wanted to help, give fifteen<br>or twenty even, but keep three roubles for yourself at least, but he<br>flung away all the twenty-five at once!”<br><br>“Maybe I found a treasure somewhere and you know nothing of it? So<br>that’s why I was liberal yesterday.... Mr. Zametov knows I’ve found a<br>treasure! Excuse us, please, for disturbing you for half an hour<br>with such trivialities,” he said, turning to Porfiry Petrovitch, with<br>trembling lips. “We are boring you, aren’t we?”<br><br>“Oh no, quite the contrary, quite the contrary! If only you knew how you<br>interest me! It’s interesting to look on and listen... and I am really<br>glad you have come forward at last.”<br><br>“But you might give us some tea! My throat’s dry,” cried Razumihin.<br><br>“Capital idea! Perhaps we will all keep you company. Wouldn’t you<br>like... something more essential before tea?”<br><br>“Get along with you!”<br><br>Porfiry Petrovitch went out to order tea.<br><br>Raskolnikov’s thoughts were in a whirl. He was in terrible exasperation.<br><br>“The worst of it is they don’t disguise it; they don’t care to stand on<br>ceremony! And how if you didn’t know me at all, did you come to talk<br>to Nikodim Fomitch about me? So they don’t care to hide that they are<br>tracking me like a pack of dogs. They simply spit in my face.” He was<br>shaking with rage. “Come, strike me openly, don’t play with me like a<br>cat with a mouse. It’s hardly civil, Porfiry Petrovitch, but perhaps I<br>won’t allow it! I shall get up and throw the whole truth in your ugly<br>faces, and you’ll see how I despise you.” He could hardly breathe.<br>“And what if it’s only my fancy? What if I am mistaken, and through<br>inexperience I get angry and don’t keep up my nasty part? Perhaps it’s<br>all unintentional. All their phrases are the usual ones, but there is<br>something about them.... It all might be said, but there is something.<br>Why did he say bluntly, ‘With her’? Why did Zametov add that I spoke<br>artfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes, the tone.... Razumihin<br>is sitting here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never<br>does see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of<br>course it’s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset<br>my nerves or are they teasing me? Either it’s ill fancy or they know!<br>Even Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind.<br>I foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here, while it’s my<br>first visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back<br>to him. They’re as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they<br>were talking about me before we came. Do they know about the flat? If<br>only they’d make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he<br>let it pass.... I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use<br>afterwards.... Delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last<br>night! He didn’t know of my mother’s arrival! The hag had written the<br>date on in pencil! You are wrong, you won’t catch me! There are no<br>facts... it’s all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isn’t a<br>fact but delirium. I know what to say to them.... Do they know about the<br>flat? I won’t go without finding out. What did I come for? But my being<br>angry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps that’s<br>right; to play the invalid.... He is feeling me. He will try to catch<br>me. Why did I come?”<br><br>All this flashed like lightning through his mind.<br><br>Porfiry Petrovitch returned quickly. He became suddenly more jovial.<br><br>“Your party yesterday, brother, has left my head rather.... And I am out<br>of sorts altogether,” he began in quite a different tone, laughing to<br>Razumihin.<br><br>“Was it interesting? I left you yesterday at the most interesting point.<br>Who got the best of it?”<br><br>“Oh, no one, of course. They got on to everlasting questions, floated<br>off into space.”<br><br>“Only fancy, Rodya, what we got on to yesterday. Whether there is such a<br>thing as crime. I told you that we talked our heads off.”<br><br>“What is there strange? It’s an everyday social question,” Raskolnikov<br>answered casually.<br><br>“The question wasn’t put quite like that,” observed Porfiry.<br><br>“Not quite, that’s true,” Razumihin agreed at once, getting warm and<br>hurried as usual. “Listen, Rodion, and tell us your opinion, I want to<br>hear it. I was fighting tooth and nail with them and wanted you to<br>help me. I told them you were coming.... It began with the socialist<br>doctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the<br>abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing<br>more; no other causes admitted!...”<br><br>“You are wrong there,” cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably<br>animated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him<br>more excited than ever.<br><br>“Nothing is admitted,” Razumihin interrupted with heat.<br><br>“I am not wrong. I’ll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them<br>is ‘the influence of environment,’ and nothing else. Their favourite<br>phrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised,<br>all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest<br>against and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature<br>is not taken into account, it is excluded, it’s not supposed to exist!<br>They don’t recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living<br>process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a<br>social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going<br>to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an<br>instant, quicker than any living process! That’s why they instinctively<br>dislike history, ‘nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,’ and they<br>explain it all as stupidity! That’s why they so dislike the _living_<br>process of life; they don’t want a _living soul_! The living soul<br>demands life, the soul won’t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an<br>object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though<br>it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not<br>alive, has no will, is servile and won’t revolt! And it comes in the end<br>to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning<br>of rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready,<br>indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery--it<br>wants life, it hasn’t completed its vital process, it’s too soon for the<br>graveyard! You can’t skip over nature by logic. Logic presupposes three<br>possibilities, but there are millions! Cut away a million, and reduce<br>it all to the question of comfort! That’s the easiest solution of the<br>problem! It’s seductively clear and you musn’t think about it. That’s<br>the great thing, you mustn’t think! The whole secret of life in two<br>pages of print!”<br><br>“Now he is off, beating the drum! Catch hold of him, do!” laughed<br>Porfiry. “Can you imagine,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “six people<br>holding forth like that last night, in one room, with punch as a<br>preliminary! No, brother, you are wrong, environment accounts for a<br>great deal in crime; I can assure you of that.”<br><br>“Oh, I know it does, but just tell me: a man of forty violates a child<br>of ten; was it environment drove him to it?”<br><br>“Well, strictly speaking, it did,” Porfiry observed with noteworthy<br>gravity; “a crime of that nature may be very well ascribed to the<br>influence of environment.”<br><br>Razumihin was almost in a frenzy. “Oh, if you like,” he roared. “I’ll<br>prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the<br>Church of Ivan the Great’s being two hundred and fifty feet high, and I<br>will prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal<br>tendency! I undertake to! Will you bet on it?”<br><br>“Done! Let’s hear, please, how he will prove it!”<br><br>“He is always humbugging, confound him,” cried Razumihin, jumping up and<br>gesticulating. “What’s the use of talking to you? He does all that<br>on purpose; you don’t know him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday,<br>simply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they<br>were delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he<br>persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two<br>months. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going<br>to get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered<br>new clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was no<br>bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!”<br><br>“Ah, you are wrong! I got the clothes before. It was the new clothes in<br>fact that made me think of taking you in.”<br><br>“Are you such a good dissembler?” Raskolnikov asked carelessly.<br><br>“You wouldn’t have supposed it, eh? Wait a bit, I shall take you in,<br>too. Ha-ha-ha! No, I’ll tell you the truth. All these questions about<br>crime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours<br>which interested me at the time. ‘On Crime’... or something of the<br>sort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the<br>_Periodical Review_.”<br><br>“My article? In the _Periodical Review_?” Raskolnikov asked in<br>astonishment. “I certainly did write an article upon a book six months<br>ago when I left the university, but I sent it to the _Weekly Review_.”<br><br>“But it came out in the _Periodical_.”<br><br>“And the _Weekly Review_ ceased to exist, so that’s why it wasn’t<br>printed at the time.”<br><br>“That’s true; but when it ceased to exist, the _Weekly Review_ was<br>amalgamated with the _Periodical_, and so your article appeared two<br>months ago in the latter. Didn’t you know?”<br><br>Raskolnikov had not known.<br><br>“Why, you might get some money out of them for the article! What a<br>strange person you are! You lead such a solitary life that you know<br>nothing of matters that concern you directly. It’s a fact, I assure<br>you.”<br><br>“Bravo, Rodya! I knew nothing about it either!” cried Razumihin. “I’ll<br>run to-day to the reading-room and ask for the number. Two months ago?<br>What was the date? It doesn’t matter though, I will find it. Think of<br>not telling us!”<br><br>“How did you find out that the article was mine? It’s only signed with<br>an initial.”<br><br>“I only learnt it by chance, the other day. Through the editor; I know<br>him.... I was very much interested.”<br><br>“I analysed, if I remember, the psychology of a criminal before and<br>after the crime.”<br><br>“Yes, and you maintained that the perpetration of a crime is always<br>accompanied by illness. Very, very original, but... it was not that part<br>of your article that interested me so much, but an idea at the end of<br>the article which I regret to say you merely suggested without working<br>it out clearly. There is, if you recollect, a suggestion that there are<br>certain persons who can... that is, not precisely are able to, but have<br>a perfect right to commit breaches of morality and crimes, and that the<br>law is not for them.”<br><br>Raskolnikov smiled at the exaggerated and intentional distortion of his<br>idea.<br><br>“What? What do you mean? A right to crime? But not because of the<br>influence of environment?” Razumihin inquired with some alarm even.<br><br>“No, not exactly because of it,” answered Porfiry. “In his article all<br>men are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’ Ordinary men have<br>to live in submission, have no right to transgress the law, because,<br>don’t you see, they are ordinary. But extraordinary men have a right to<br>commit any crime and to transgress the law in any way, just because they<br>are extraordinary. That was your idea, if I am not mistaken?”<br><br>“What do you mean? That can’t be right?” Razumihin muttered in<br>bewilderment.<br><br>Raskolnikov smiled again. He saw the point at once, and knew where they<br>wanted to drive him. He decided to take up the challenge.<br><br>“That wasn’t quite my contention,” he began simply and modestly. “Yet<br>I admit that you have stated it almost correctly; perhaps, if you like,<br>perfectly so.” (It almost gave him pleasure to admit this.) “The only<br>difference is that I don’t contend that extraordinary people are always<br>bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt<br>whether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an<br>‘extraordinary’ man has the right... that is not an official right, but<br>an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain<br>obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment<br>of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).<br>You say that my article isn’t definite; I am ready to make it as clear<br>as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I<br>maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have<br>been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a<br>hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have<br>been in duty-bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for<br>the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But<br>it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people<br>right and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I<br>maintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men,<br>such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without<br>exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they<br>transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held<br>sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either,<br>if that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence<br>of ancient law--were of use to their cause. It’s remarkable, in fact,<br>that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity<br>were guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men<br>or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving<br>some new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less,<br>of course. Otherwise it’s hard for them to get out of the common rut;<br>and to remain in the common rut is what they can’t submit to, from their<br>very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to<br>it. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The<br>same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my<br>division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that<br>it’s somewhat arbitrary, but I don’t insist upon exact numbers. I only<br>believe in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law<br>of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say,<br>material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have<br>the gift or the talent to utter _a new word_. There are, of course,<br>innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both<br>categories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally<br>speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live<br>under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty<br>to be controlled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing<br>humiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the<br>law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their<br>capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied;<br>for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the<br>present for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the<br>sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I<br>maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading<br>through blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.<br>It’s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article<br>(you remember it began with the legal question). There’s no need for<br>such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right,<br>they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil<br>quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these<br>criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or<br>less). The first category is always the man of the present, the second<br>the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the<br>second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal<br>right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me--and _vive la<br>guerre éternelle_--till the New Jerusalem, of course!”<br><br>“Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?”<br><br>“I do,” Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during<br>the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.<br><br>“And... and do you believe in God? Excuse my curiosity.”<br><br>“I do,” repeated Raskolnikov, raising his eyes to Porfiry.<br><br>“And... do you believe in Lazarus’ rising from the dead?”<br><br>“I... I do. Why do you ask all this?”<br><br>“You believe it literally?”<br><br>“Literally.”<br><br>“You don’t say so.... I asked from curiosity. Excuse me. But let us<br>go back to the question; they are not always executed. Some, on the<br>contrary...”<br><br>“Triumph in their lifetime? Oh, yes, some attain their ends in this<br>life, and then...”<br><br>“They begin executing other people?”<br><br>“If it’s necessary; indeed, for the most part they do. Your remark is<br>very witty.”<br><br>“Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary<br>people from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feel<br>there ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. Excuse the<br>natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn’t they<br>adopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn’t they wear something, be<br>branded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member of<br>one category imagines that he belongs to the other, begins to ‘eliminate<br>obstacles’ as you so happily expressed it, then...”<br><br>“Oh, that very often happens! That remark is wittier than the other.”<br><br>“Thank you.”<br><br>“No reason to; but take note that the mistake can only arise in<br>the first category, that is among the ordinary people (as I perhaps<br>unfortunately called them). In spite of their predisposition to<br>obedience very many of them, through a playfulness of nature, sometimes<br>vouchsafed even to the cow, like to imagine themselves advanced people,<br>‘destroyers,’ and to push themselves into the ‘new movement,’ and<br>this quite sincerely. Meanwhile the really _new_ people are very often<br>unobserved by them, or even despised as reactionaries of grovelling<br>tendencies. But I don’t think there is any considerable danger here,<br>and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course,<br>they might have a thrashing sometimes for letting their fancy run away<br>with them and to teach them their place, but no more; in fact, even<br>this isn’t necessary as they castigate themselves, for they are very<br>conscientious: some perform this service for one another and others<br>chastise themselves with their own hands.... They will impose various<br>public acts of penitence upon themselves with a beautiful and edifying<br>effect; in fact you’ve nothing to be uneasy about.... It’s a law of<br>nature.”<br><br>“Well, you have certainly set my mind more at rest on that score; but<br>there’s another thing worries me. Tell me, please, are there many people<br>who have the right to kill others, these extraordinary people? I am<br>ready to bow down to them, of course, but you must admit it’s alarming<br>if there are a great many of them, eh?”<br><br>“Oh, you needn’t worry about that either,” Raskolnikov went on in the<br>same tone. “People with new ideas, people with the faintest capacity for<br>saying something _new_, are extremely few in number, extraordinarily<br>so in fact. One thing only is clear, that the appearance of all these<br>grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity<br>some law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am<br>convinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass of<br>mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort,<br>by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and<br>stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a<br>thousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps--I<br>speak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and with<br>still greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius<br>is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity,<br>appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have<br>not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there<br>certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of<br>chance.”<br><br>“Why, are you both joking?” Razumihin cried at last. “There you sit,<br>making fun of one another. Are you serious, Rodya?”<br><br>Raskolnikov raised his pale and almost mournful face and made no reply.<br>And the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and _discourteous_ sarcasm of<br>Porfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.<br><br>“Well, brother, if you are really serious... You are right, of course,<br>in saying that it’s not new, that it’s like what we’ve read and heard a<br>thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is<br>exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed<br>_in the name of conscience_, and, excuse my saying so, with such<br>fanaticism.... That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that<br>sanction of bloodshed _by conscience_ is to my mind... more terrible<br>than the official, legal sanction of bloodshed....”<br><br>“You are quite right, it is more terrible,” Porfiry agreed.<br><br>“Yes, you must have exaggerated! There is some mistake, I shall read it.<br>You can’t think that! I shall read it.”<br><br>“All that is not in the article, there’s only a hint of it,” said<br>Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Yes, yes.” Porfiry couldn’t sit still. “Your attitude to crime is<br>pretty clear to me now, but... excuse me for my impertinence (I am<br>really ashamed to be worrying you like this), you see, you’ve removed<br>my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but... there are various<br>practical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth<br>imagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--and<br>suppose he begins to remove all obstacles.... He has some great<br>enterprise before him and needs money for it... and tries to get it...<br>do you see?”<br><br>Zametov gave a sudden guffaw in his corner. Raskolnikov did not even<br>raise his eyes to him.<br><br>“I must admit,” he went on calmly, “that such cases certainly must<br>arise. The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that<br>snare; young people especially.”<br><br>“Yes, you see. Well then?”<br><br>“What then?” Raskolnikov smiled in reply; “that’s not my fault. So it is<br>and so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin)<br>that I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons,<br>banishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude. There’s no need to<br>be uneasy. You have but to catch the thief.”<br><br>“And what if we do catch him?”<br><br>“Then he gets what he deserves.”<br><br>“You are certainly logical. But what of his conscience?”<br><br>“Why do you care about that?”<br><br>“Simply from humanity.”<br><br>“If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be his<br>punishment--as well as the prison.”<br><br>“But the real geniuses,” asked Razumihin frowning, “those who have<br>the right to murder? Oughtn’t they to suffer at all even for the blood<br>they’ve shed?”<br><br>“Why the word _ought_? It’s not a matter of permission or prohibition.<br>He will suffer if he is sorry for his victim. Pain and suffering are<br>always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The<br>really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth,” he added<br>dreamily, not in the tone of the conversation.<br><br>He raised his eyes, looked earnestly at them all, smiled, and took his<br>cap. He was too quiet by comparison with his manner at his entrance, and<br>he felt this. Everyone got up.<br><br>“Well, you may abuse me, be angry with me if you like,” Porfiry<br>Petrovitch began again, “but I can’t resist. Allow me one little<br>question (I know I am troubling you). There is just one little notion I<br>want to express, simply that I may not forget it.”<br><br>“Very good, tell me your little notion,” Raskolnikov stood waiting, pale<br>and grave before him.<br><br>“Well, you see... I really don’t know how to express it properly....<br>It’s a playful, psychological idea.... When you were writing your<br>article, surely you couldn’t have helped, he-he! fancying yourself...<br>just a little, an ‘extraordinary’ man, uttering a _new word_ in your<br>sense.... That’s so, isn’t it?”<br><br>“Quite possibly,” Raskolnikov answered contemptuously.<br><br>Razumihin made a movement.<br><br>“And, if so, could you bring yourself in case of worldly difficulties<br>and hardship or for some service to humanity--to overstep obstacles?...<br>For instance, to rob and murder?”<br><br>And again he winked with his left eye, and laughed noiselessly just as<br>before.<br><br>“If I did I certainly should not tell you,” Raskolnikov answered with<br>defiant and haughty contempt.<br><br>“No, I was only interested on account of your article, from a literary<br>point of view...”<br><br>“Foo! how obvious and insolent that is!” Raskolnikov thought with<br>repulsion.<br><br>“Allow me to observe,” he answered dryly, “that I don’t consider myself<br>a Mahomet or a Napoleon, nor any personage of that kind, and not being<br>one of them I cannot tell you how I should act.”<br><br>“Oh, come, don’t we all think ourselves Napoleons now in Russia?”<br> Porfiry Petrovitch said with alarming familiarity.<br><br>Something peculiar betrayed itself in the very intonation of his voice.<br><br>“Perhaps it was one of these future Napoleons who did for Alyona<br>Ivanovna last week?” Zametov blurted out from the corner.<br><br>Raskolnikov did not speak, but looked firmly and intently at Porfiry.<br>Razumihin was scowling gloomily. He seemed before this to be noticing<br>something. He looked angrily around. There was a minute of gloomy<br>silence. Raskolnikov turned to go.<br><br>“Are you going already?” Porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with<br>excessive politeness. “Very, very glad of your acquaintance. As for your<br>request, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still,<br>come to me there yourself in a day or two... to-morrow, indeed. I shall<br>be there at eleven o’clock for certain. We’ll arrange it all; we’ll have<br>a talk. As one of the last to be _there_, you might perhaps be able to<br>tell us something,” he added with a most good-natured expression.<br><br>“You want to cross-examine me officially in due form?” Raskolnikov asked<br>sharply.<br><br>“Oh, why? That’s not necessary for the present. You misunderstand me.<br>I lose no opportunity, you see, and... I’ve talked with all who had<br>pledges.... I obtained evidence from some of them, and you are the<br>last.... Yes, by the way,” he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, “I<br>just remember, what was I thinking of?” he turned to Razumihin, “you<br>were talking my ears off about that Nikolay... of course, I know, I know<br>very well,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “that the fellow is innocent, but<br>what is one to do? We had to trouble Dmitri too.... This is the point,<br>this is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn’t it?”<br><br>“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very<br>moment he spoke that he need not have said it.<br><br>“Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn’t you see in<br>a flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember? two workmen<br>or at least one of them? They were painting there, didn’t you notice<br>them? It’s very, very important for them.”<br><br>“Painters? No, I didn’t see them,” Raskolnikov answered slowly, as<br>though ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking<br>every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as<br>possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. “No, I didn’t<br>see them, and I don’t think I noticed a flat like that open.... But on<br>the fourth storey” (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant)<br>“I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona<br>Ivanovna’s.... I remember... I remember it clearly. Some porters<br>were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. But<br>painters... no, I don’t remember that there were any painters, and I<br>don’t think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn’t.”<br><br>“What do you mean?” Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had<br>reflected and realised. “Why, it was on the day of the murder the<br>painters were at work, and he was there three days before? What are you<br>asking?”<br><br>“Foo! I have muddled it!” Porfiry slapped himself on the forehead.<br>“Deuce take it! This business is turning my brain!” he addressed<br>Raskolnikov somewhat apologetically. “It would be such a great thing for<br>us to find out whether anyone had seen them between seven and eight at<br>the flat, so I fancied you could perhaps have told us something.... I<br>quite muddled it.”<br><br>“Then you should be more careful,” Razumihin observed grimly.<br><br>The last words were uttered in the passage. Porfiry Petrovitch saw them<br>to the door with excessive politeness.<br><br>They went out into the street gloomy and sullen, and for some steps they<br>did not say a word. Raskolnikov drew a deep breath.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>“I don’t believe it, I can’t believe it!” repeated Razumihin, trying in<br>perplexity to refute Raskolnikov’s arguments.<br><br>They were by now approaching Bakaleyev’s lodgings, where Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while. Razumihin<br>kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited<br>by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about<br>_it_.<br><br>“Don’t believe it, then!” answered Raskolnikov, with a cold, careless<br>smile. “You were noticing nothing as usual, but I was weighing every<br>word.”<br><br>“You are suspicious. That is why you weighed their words... h’m...<br>certainly, I agree, Porfiry’s tone was rather strange, and still<br>more that wretch Zametov!... You are right, there was something about<br>him--but why? Why?”<br><br>“He has changed his mind since last night.”<br><br>“Quite the contrary! If they had that brainless idea, they would do<br>their utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you<br>afterwards.... But it was all impudent and careless.”<br><br>“If they had had facts--I mean, real facts--or at least grounds for<br>suspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game,<br>in the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long ago<br>besides). But they have no facts, not one. It is all mirage--all<br>ambiguous. Simply a floating idea. So they try to throw me out by<br>impudence. And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted<br>it out in his vexation--or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an<br>intelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to<br>know. They have a psychology of their own, brother. But it is loathsome<br>explaining it all. Stop!”<br><br>“And it’s insulting, insulting! I understand you. But... since we have<br>spoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--I<br>am glad) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago,<br>this idea. Of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why an<br>insinuation even? How dare they? What foundation have they? If only you<br>knew how furious I have been. Think only! Simply because a poor student,<br>unhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe delirious<br>illness (note that), suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to<br>speak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to<br>face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and<br>the unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the I.O.U. presented<br>by Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling<br>atmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person<br>where he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach--he<br>might well have a fainting fit! And that, that is what they found it<br>all on! Damn them! I understand how annoying it is, but in your place,<br>Rodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces,<br>and spit a dozen times in all directions. I’d hit out in all<br>directions, neatly too, and so I’d put an end to it. Damn them! Don’t be<br>downhearted. It’s a shame!”<br><br>“He really has put it well, though,” Raskolnikov thought.<br><br>“Damn them? But the cross-examination again, to-morrow?” he said with<br>bitterness. “Must I really enter into explanations with them? I feel<br>vexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the<br>restaurant....”<br><br>“Damn it! I will go myself to Porfiry. I will squeeze it out of him, as<br>one of the family: he must let me know the ins and outs of it all! And<br>as for Zametov...”<br><br>“At last he sees through him!” thought Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Stay!” cried Razumihin, seizing him by the shoulder again. “Stay! you<br>were wrong. I have thought it out. You are wrong! How was that a trap?<br>You say that the question about the workmen was a trap. But if you had<br>done _that_, could you have said you had seen them painting the flat...<br>and the workmen? On the contrary, you would have seen nothing, even if<br>you had seen it. Who would own it against himself?”<br><br>“If I had done _that thing_, I should certainly have said that I had<br>seen the workmen and the flat,” Raskolnikov answered, with reluctance<br>and obvious disgust.<br><br>“But why speak against yourself?”<br><br>“Because only peasants, or the most inexperienced novices deny<br>everything flatly at examinations. If a man is ever so little developed<br>and experienced, he will certainly try to admit all the external facts<br>that can’t be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, will<br>introduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them another<br>significance and put them in another light. Porfiry might well reckon<br>that I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them to give an<br>air of truth, and then make some explanation.”<br><br>“But he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been<br>there two days before, and that therefore you must have been there on<br>the day of the murder at eight o’clock. And so he would have caught you<br>over a detail.”<br><br>“Yes, that is what he was reckoning on, that I should not have time to<br>reflect, and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer, and<br>so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days<br>before.”<br><br>“But how could you forget it?”<br><br>“Nothing easier. It is in just such stupid things clever people are most<br>easily caught. The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that he<br>will be caught in a simple thing. The more cunning a man is, the simpler<br>the trap he must be caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as you<br>think....”<br><br>“He is a knave then, if that is so!”<br><br>Raskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the very moment, he was<br>struck by the strangeness of his own frankness, and the eagerness<br>with which he had made this explanation, though he had kept up all the<br>preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive,<br>from necessity.<br><br>“I am getting a relish for certain aspects!” he thought to himself.<br>But almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy, as though an<br>unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him. His uneasiness kept on<br>increasing. They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev’s.<br><br>“Go in alone!” said Raskolnikov suddenly. “I will be back directly.”<br><br>“Where are you going? Why, we are just here.”<br><br>“I can’t help it.... I will come in half an hour. Tell them.”<br><br>“Say what you like, I will come with you.”<br><br>“You, too, want to torture me!” he screamed, with such bitter<br>irritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumihin’s hands dropped.<br>He stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikov<br>striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging. At last, gritting<br>his teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry<br>like a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence.<br><br>When Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he was<br>breathing heavily. He went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his<br>unlocked room and at once fastened the latch. Then in senseless terror<br>he rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had put<br>the things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the<br>hole, in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, he got up<br>and drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyev’s, he<br>suddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper<br>in which they had been wrapped with the old woman’s handwriting on it,<br>might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then<br>might suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him.<br><br>He stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half<br>senseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his cap at last and went<br>quietly out of the room. His ideas were all tangled. He went dreamily<br>through the gateway.<br><br>“Here he is himself,” shouted a loud voice.<br><br>He raised his head.<br><br>The porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing<br>him out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat<br>and a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman. He<br>stooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled<br>flabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and<br>they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.<br><br>“What is it?” Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.<br><br>The man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him<br>attentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the<br>gate into the street without saying a word.<br><br>“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your<br>name and whom you lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed you out and<br>he went away. It’s funny.”<br><br>The porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after<br>wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room.<br><br>Raskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of<br>him walking along the other side of the street with the same even,<br>deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in<br>meditation. He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.<br>At last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face. The man<br>noticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again;<br>and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.<br><br>“You were inquiring for me... of the porter?” Raskolnikov said at last,<br>but in a curiously quiet voice.<br><br>The man made no answer; he didn’t even look at him. Again they were both<br>silent.<br><br>“Why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... What’s the<br>meaning of it?”<br><br>Raskolnikov’s voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words<br>clearly.<br><br>The man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at<br>Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Murderer!” he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.<br><br>Raskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak, a<br>cold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for<br>a moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. So<br>they walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.<br><br>The man did not look at him.<br><br>“What do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer?” muttered<br>Raskolnikov hardly audibly.<br><br>“_You_ are a murderer,” the man answered still more articulately and<br>emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked<br>straight into Raskolnikov’s pale face and stricken eyes.<br><br>They had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left<br>without looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after<br>him. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still<br>standing there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that<br>he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.<br><br>With slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way<br>back to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. He took off his cap<br>and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.<br>Then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he<br>stretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.<br><br>He thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some<br>images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of<br>people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would<br>never have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table<br>in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars<br>in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite<br>dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the<br>Sunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one<br>another, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried<br>to clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression<br>within him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even<br>pleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that too<br>was an almost pleasant sensation.<br><br>He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and<br>pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for some<br>time in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into<br>the room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya’s<br>whisper:<br><br>“Don’t disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his dinner later.”<br><br>“Quite so,” answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed the<br>door. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on<br>his back again, clasping his hands behind his head.<br><br>“Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he,<br>what did he see? He has seen it all, that’s clear. Where was he then?<br>And from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?<br>And how could he see? Is it possible? Hm...” continued Raskolnikov,<br>turning cold and shivering, “and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the<br>door--was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and you<br>can build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is it<br>possible?” He felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he<br>had become. “I ought to have known it,” he thought with a bitter smile.<br>“And how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an<br>axe and shed blood! I ought to have known beforehand.... Ah, but I did<br>know!” he whispered in despair. At times he came to a standstill at some<br>thought.<br><br>“No, those men are not made so. The real _Master_ to whom all is<br>permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, _forgets_ an army in<br>Egypt, _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off<br>with a jest at Vilna. And altars are set up to him after his death, and<br>so _all_ is permitted. No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but<br>of bronze!”<br><br>One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Napoleon, the<br>pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with<br>a red trunk under her bed--it’s a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to<br>digest! How can they digest it! It’s too inartistic. “A Napoleon creep<br>under an old woman’s bed! Ugh, how loathsome!”<br><br>At moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of feverish<br>excitement. “The old woman is of no consequence,” he thought, hotly and<br>incoherently. “The old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not<br>what matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to<br>overstep.... I didn’t kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the<br>principle, but I didn’t overstep, I stopped on this side.... I was<br>only capable of killing. And it seems I wasn’t even capable of that...<br>Principle? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists? They are<br>industrious, commercial people; ‘the happiness of all’ is their case.<br>No, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I<br>don’t want to wait for ‘the happiness of all.’ I want to live myself,<br>or else better not live at all. I simply couldn’t pass by my mother<br>starving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the<br>‘happiness of all.’ I am putting my little brick into the happiness of<br>all and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only<br>live once, I too want.... Ech, I am an æsthetic louse and nothing<br>more,” he added suddenly, laughing like a madman. “Yes, I am certainly a<br>louse,” he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing<br>with it with vindictive pleasure. “In the first place, because I can<br>reason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been<br>troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for<br>my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble<br>object--ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as<br>possible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked<br>out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I<br>needed for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone<br>to a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And what shows that I<br>am utterly a louse,” he added, grinding his teeth, “is that I am<br>perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and _I felt<br>beforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her. Can<br>anything be compared with the horror of that? The vulgarity! The<br>abjectness! I understand the ‘prophet’ with his sabre, on his steed:<br>Allah commands and ‘trembling’ creation must obey! The ‘prophet’ is<br>right, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up<br>the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! It’s for you to<br>obey, trembling creation, and not _to have desires_, for that’s not for<br>you!... I shall never, never forgive the old woman!”<br><br>His hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his<br>eyes were fixed on the ceiling.<br><br>“Mother, sister--how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate<br>them, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can’t bear them near me....<br>I went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember.... To embrace her<br>and think if she only knew... shall I tell her then? That’s just what<br>I might do.... _She_ must be the same as I am,” he added, straining<br>himself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. “Ah, how I hate<br>the old woman now! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!<br>Poor Lizaveta! Why did she come in?... It’s strange though, why is it<br>I scarcely ever think of her, as though I hadn’t killed her? Lizaveta!<br>Sonia! Poor gentle things, with gentle eyes.... Dear women! Why don’t<br>they weep? Why don’t they moan? They give up everything... their eyes<br>are soft and gentle.... Sonia, Sonia! Gentle Sonia!”<br><br>He lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didn’t remember<br>how he got into the street. It was late evening. The twilight had fallen<br>and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a<br>peculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in the<br>street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other<br>people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and<br>stagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was<br>distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do<br>something in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he<br>stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,<br>beckoning to him. He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and<br>walked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to<br>him. “Stay, did he really beckon?” Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried<br>to overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and<br>was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long<br>coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;<br>they went down a turning; the man still did not look round. “Does he<br>know I am following him?” thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the<br>gateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in<br>to see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard<br>the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at<br>once followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have<br>gone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard<br>slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely<br>familiar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone<br>through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he<br>reached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were<br>at work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps<br>of the man above had died away. “So he must have stopped or hidden<br>somewhere.” He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was a<br>stillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own<br>footsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be<br>hiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he<br>hesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as<br>though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour<br>which was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, the<br>chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the<br>frames. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.<br>“It’s the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,” thought<br>Raskolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more<br>silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was<br>painful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp<br>crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A fly<br>flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At<br>that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little<br>cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. “Why is that cloak<br>here?” he thought, “it wasn’t there before....” He went up to it quietly<br>and felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved<br>the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent<br>double so that he couldn’t see her face; but it was she. He stood over<br>her. “She is afraid,” he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the<br>noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. But strange<br>to say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. He was<br>frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,<br>bent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped up<br>into her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old<br>woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing<br>her utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the door<br>from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and<br>whispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the<br>old woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe<br>the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old<br>woman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away, but the<br>passage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the<br>landing, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of<br>heads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.<br>Something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they<br>would not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.<br><br>He drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:<br>his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the<br>doorway watching him intently.<br><br>Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them<br>again. He lay on his back without stirring.<br><br>“Is it still a dream?” he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly<br>perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching<br>him.<br><br>He stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after<br>him, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on<br>Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he<br>put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane<br>and his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait<br>indefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen<br>glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost<br>whitish beard.<br><br>Ten minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. There<br>was complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.<br>Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was<br>unbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.<br><br>“Come, tell me what you want.”<br><br>“I knew you were not asleep, but only pretending,” the stranger answered<br>oddly, laughing calmly. “Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, allow me to<br>introduce myself....”<br><br><br><br><br>PART IV<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>“Can this be still a dream?” Raskolnikov thought once more.<br><br>He looked carefully and suspiciously at the unexpected visitor.<br><br>“Svidrigaïlov! What nonsense! It can’t be!” he said at last aloud in<br>bewilderment.<br><br>His visitor did not seem at all surprised at this exclamation.<br><br>“I’ve come to you for two reasons. In the first place, I wanted to make<br>your personal acquaintance, as I have already heard a great deal about<br>you that is interesting and flattering; secondly, I cherish the hope<br>that you may not refuse to assist me in a matter directly concerning the<br>welfare of your sister, Avdotya Romanovna. For without your support she<br>might not let me come near her now, for she is prejudiced against me,<br>but with your assistance I reckon on...”<br><br>“You reckon wrongly,” interrupted Raskolnikov.<br><br>“They only arrived yesterday, may I ask you?”<br><br>Raskolnikov made no reply.<br><br>“It was yesterday, I know. I only arrived myself the day before. Well,<br>let me tell you this, Rodion Romanovitch, I don’t consider it necessary<br>to justify myself, but kindly tell me what was there particularly<br>criminal on my part in all this business, speaking without prejudice,<br>with common sense?”<br><br>Raskolnikov continued to look at him in silence.<br><br>“That in my own house I persecuted a defenceless girl and ‘insulted her<br>with my infamous proposals’--is that it? (I am anticipating you.) But<br>you’ve only to assume that I, too, am a man _et nihil humanum_... in a<br>word, that I am capable of being attracted and falling in love (which<br>does not depend on our will), then everything can be explained in the<br>most natural manner. The question is, am I a monster, or am I myself<br>a victim? And what if I am a victim? In proposing to the object of my<br>passion to elope with me to America or Switzerland, I may have cherished<br>the deepest respect for her and may have thought that I was promoting<br>our mutual happiness! Reason is the slave of passion, you know; why,<br>probably, I was doing more harm to myself than anyone!”<br><br>“But that’s not the point,” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. “It’s<br>simply that whether you are right or wrong, we dislike you. We don’t<br>want to have anything to do with you. We show you the door. Go out!”<br><br>Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh.<br><br>“But you’re... but there’s no getting round you,” he said, laughing in<br>the frankest way. “I hoped to get round you, but you took up the right<br>line at once!”<br><br>“But you are trying to get round me still!”<br><br>“What of it? What of it?” cried Svidrigaïlov, laughing openly. “But this<br>is what the French call _bonne guerre_, and the most innocent form of<br>deception!... But still you have interrupted me; one way or another, I<br>repeat again: there would never have been any unpleasantness except for<br>what happened in the garden. Marfa Petrovna...”<br><br>“You have got rid of Marfa Petrovna, too, so they say?” Raskolnikov<br>interrupted rudely.<br><br>“Oh, you’ve heard that, too, then? You’d be sure to, though.... But<br>as for your question, I really don’t know what to say, though my own<br>conscience is quite at rest on that score. Don’t suppose that I am in<br>any apprehension about it. All was regular and in order; the medical<br>inquiry diagnosed apoplexy due to bathing immediately after a heavy<br>dinner and a bottle of wine, and indeed it could have proved nothing<br>else. But I’ll tell you what I have been thinking to myself of late, on<br>my way here in the train, especially: didn’t I contribute to all that...<br>calamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of the<br>sort. But I came to the conclusion that that, too, was quite out of the<br>question.”<br><br>Raskolnikov laughed.<br><br>“I wonder you trouble yourself about it!”<br><br>“But what are you laughing at? Only consider, I struck her just twice<br>with a switch--there were no marks even... don’t regard me as a cynic,<br>please; I am perfectly aware how atrocious it was of me and all that;<br>but I know for certain, too, that Marfa Petrovna was very likely pleased<br>at my, so to say, warmth. The story of your sister had been wrung out to<br>the last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced to<br>sit at home; she had nothing to show herself with in the town. Besides,<br>she had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading the<br>letter). And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven! Her<br>first act was to order the carriage to be got out.... Not to speak<br>of the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to be<br>insulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There are instances<br>of it with everyone; human beings in general, indeed, greatly love to<br>be insulted, have you noticed that? But it’s particularly so with women.<br>One might even say it’s their only amusement.”<br><br>At one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so<br>finishing the interview. But some curiosity and even a sort of prudence<br>made him linger for a moment.<br><br>“You are fond of fighting?” he asked carelessly.<br><br>“No, not very,” Svidrigaïlov answered, calmly. “And Marfa Petrovna and<br>I scarcely ever fought. We lived very harmoniously, and she was always<br>pleased with me. I only used the whip twice in all our seven years (not<br>counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character). The first<br>time, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in the<br>country, and the last time was that of which we are speaking. Did you<br>suppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver?<br>Ha, ha! By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years<br>ago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I’ve forgotten<br>his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having<br>thrashed a German woman in the railway train. You remember? It was in<br>those days, that very year I believe, the ‘disgraceful action of the<br>_Age_’ took place (you know, ‘The Egyptian Nights,’ that public reading,<br>you remember? The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of our youth,<br>where are they?). Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German,<br>I feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is there<br>for sympathy? But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking<br>‘Germans’ that I don’t believe there is a progressive who could quite<br>answer for himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of view<br>then, but that’s the truly humane point of view, I assure you.”<br><br>After saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh again.<br>Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his<br>mind and able to keep it to himself.<br><br>“I expect you’ve not talked to anyone for some days?” he asked.<br><br>“Scarcely anyone. I suppose you are wondering at my being such an<br>adaptable man?”<br><br>“No, I am only wondering at your being too adaptable a man.”<br><br>“Because I am not offended at the rudeness of your questions? Is that<br>it? But why take offence? As you asked, so I answered,” he replied,<br>with a surprising expression of simplicity. “You know, there’s<br>hardly anything I take interest in,” he went on, as it were dreamily,<br>“especially now, I’ve nothing to do.... You are quite at liberty to<br>imagine though that I am making up to you with a motive, particularly as<br>I told you I want to see your sister about something. But I’ll confess<br>frankly, I am very much bored. The last three days especially, so I am<br>delighted to see you.... Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but you<br>seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself. Say what you like, there’s<br>something wrong with you, and now, too... not this very minute, I mean,<br>but now, generally.... Well, well, I won’t, I won’t, don’t scowl! I am<br>not such a bear, you know, as you think.”<br><br>Raskolnikov looked gloomily at him.<br><br>“You are not a bear, perhaps, at all,” he said. “I fancy indeed that<br>you are a man of very good breeding, or at least know how on occasion to<br>behave like one.”<br><br>“I am not particularly interested in anyone’s opinion,” Svidrigaïlov<br>answered, dryly and even with a shade of haughtiness, “and therefore why<br>not be vulgar at times when vulgarity is such a convenient cloak for our<br>climate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way,” he<br>added, laughing again.<br><br>“But I’ve heard you have many friends here. You are, as they say, ‘not<br>without connections.’ What can you want with me, then, unless you’ve<br>some special object?”<br><br>“That’s true that I have friends here,” Svidrigaïlov admitted, not<br>replying to the chief point. “I’ve met some already. I’ve been lounging<br>about for the last three days, and I’ve seen them, or they’ve seen me.<br>That’s a matter of course. I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor<br>man; the emancipation of the serfs hasn’t affected me; my property<br>consists chiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has not<br>fallen off; but... I am not going to see them, I was sick of them long<br>ago. I’ve been here three days and have called on no one.... What a town<br>it is! How has it come into existence among us, tell me that? A town of<br>officials and students of all sorts. Yes, there’s a great deal I didn’t<br>notice when I was here eight years ago, kicking up my heels.... My only<br>hope now is in anatomy, by Jove, it is!”<br><br>“Anatomy?”<br><br>“But as for these clubs, Dussauts, parades, or progress, indeed,<br>maybe--well, all that can go on without me,” he went on, again without<br>noticing the question. “Besides, who wants to be a card-sharper?”<br><br>“Why, have you been a card-sharper then?”<br><br>“How could I help being? There was a regular set of us, men of the best<br>society, eight years ago; we had a fine time. And all men of breeding,<br>you know, poets, men of property. And indeed as a rule in our Russian<br>society the best manners are found among those who’ve been thrashed,<br>have you noticed that? I’ve deteriorated in the country. But I did get<br>into prison for debt, through a low Greek who came from Nezhin. Then<br>Marfa Petrovna turned up; she bargained with him and bought me off for<br>thirty thousand silver pieces (I owed seventy thousand). We were united<br>in lawful wedlock and she bore me off into the country like a treasure.<br>You know she was five years older than I. She was very fond of me. For<br>seven years I never left the country. And, take note, that all my life<br>she held a document over me, the IOU for thirty thousand roubles, so<br>if I were to elect to be restive about anything I should be trapped at<br>once! And she would have done it! Women find nothing incompatible in<br>that.”<br><br>“If it hadn’t been for that, would you have given her the slip?”<br><br>“I don’t know what to say. It was scarcely the document restrained me. I<br>didn’t want to go anywhere else. Marfa Petrovna herself invited me to go<br>abroad, seeing I was bored, but I’ve been abroad before, and always<br>felt sick there. For no reason, but the sunrise, the bay of Naples, the<br>sea--you look at them and it makes you sad. What’s most revolting is<br>that one is really sad! No, it’s better at home. Here at least one<br>blames others for everything and excuses oneself. I should have gone<br>perhaps on an expedition to the North Pole, because _j’ai le vin<br>mauvais_ and hate drinking, and there’s nothing left but wine. I have<br>tried it. But, I say, I’ve been told Berg is going up in a great balloon<br>next Sunday from the Yusupov Garden and will take up passengers at a<br>fee. Is it true?”<br><br>“Why, would you go up?”<br><br>“I... No, oh, no,” muttered Svidrigaïlov really seeming to be deep in<br>thought.<br><br>“What does he mean? Is he in earnest?” Raskolnikov wondered.<br><br>“No, the document didn’t restrain me,” Svidrigaïlov went on,<br>meditatively. “It was my own doing, not leaving the country, and nearly<br>a year ago Marfa Petrovna gave me back the document on my name-day<br>and made me a present of a considerable sum of money, too. She had a<br>fortune, you know. ‘You see how I trust you, Arkady Ivanovitch’--that<br>was actually her expression. You don’t believe she used it? But do<br>you know I managed the estate quite decently, they know me in the<br>neighbourhood. I ordered books, too. Marfa Petrovna at first approved,<br>but afterwards she was afraid of my over-studying.”<br><br>“You seem to be missing Marfa Petrovna very much?”<br><br>“Missing her? Perhaps. Really, perhaps I am. And, by the way, do you<br>believe in ghosts?”<br><br>“What ghosts?”<br><br>“Why, ordinary ghosts.”<br><br>“Do you believe in them?”<br><br>“Perhaps not, _pour vous plaire_.... I wouldn’t say no exactly.”<br><br>“Do you see them, then?”<br><br>Svidrigaïlov looked at him rather oddly.<br><br>“Marfa Petrovna is pleased to visit me,” he said, twisting his mouth<br>into a strange smile.<br><br>“How do you mean ‘she is pleased to visit you’?”<br><br>“She has been three times. I saw her first on the very day of the<br>funeral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day before I left to<br>come here. The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, on<br>the journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two<br>hours ago in the room where I am staying. I was alone.”<br><br>“Were you awake?”<br><br>“Quite awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes, speaks to me for<br>a minute and goes out at the door--always at the door. I can almost hear<br>her.”<br><br>“What made me think that something of the sort must be happening to<br>you?” Raskolnikov said suddenly.<br><br>At the same moment he was surprised at having said it. He was much<br>excited.<br><br>“What! Did you think so?” Svidrigaïlov asked in astonishment. “Did you<br>really? Didn’t I say that there was something in common between us, eh?”<br><br>“You never said so!” Raskolnikov cried sharply and with heat.<br><br>“Didn’t I?”<br><br>“No!”<br><br>“I thought I did. When I came in and saw you lying with your eyes shut,<br>pretending, I said to myself at once, ‘Here’s the man.’”<br><br>“What do you mean by ‘the man?’ What are you talking about?” cried<br>Raskolnikov.<br><br>“What do I mean? I really don’t know....” Svidrigaïlov muttered<br>ingenuously, as though he, too, were puzzled.<br><br>For a minute they were silent. They stared in each other’s faces.<br><br>“That’s all nonsense!” Raskolnikov shouted with vexation. “What does she<br>say when she comes to you?”<br><br>“She! Would you believe it, she talks of the silliest trifles and--man<br>is a strange creature--it makes me angry. The first time she came in (I<br>was tired you know: the funeral service, the funeral ceremony, the lunch<br>afterwards. At last I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and<br>began to think), she came in at the door. ‘You’ve been so busy to-day,<br>Arkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,’<br>she said. All those seven years I’ve wound that clock every week, and if<br>I forgot it she would always remind me. The next day I set off on my way<br>here. I got out at the station at daybreak; I’d been asleep, tired out,<br>with my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up and<br>there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of<br>cards in her hands. ‘Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady<br>Ivanovitch?’ She was a great hand at telling fortunes. I shall never<br>forgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a fright, and,<br>besides, the bell rang. I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a<br>miserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden<br>Marfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new green silk dress<br>with a long train. ‘Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like my<br>dress? Aniska can’t make like this.’ (Aniska was a dressmaker in the<br>country, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a<br>pretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress,<br>and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. ‘I wonder<br>you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘Good<br>gracious, you won’t let one disturb you about anything!’ To tease her<br>I said, ‘I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘That’s just like you,<br>Arkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a<br>bride when you’ve hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a good<br>choice, at least, but I know it won’t be for your happiness or hers, you<br>will only be a laughing-stock to all good people.’ Then she went out and<br>her train seemed to rustle. Isn’t it nonsense, eh?”<br><br>“But perhaps you are telling lies?” Raskolnikov put in.<br><br>“I rarely lie,” answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, apparently not<br>noticing the rudeness of the question.<br><br>“And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?”<br><br>“Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago. I had<br>a serf, Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting ‘Filka, my<br>pipe!’ He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were. I sat<br>still and thought ‘he is doing it out of revenge,’ because we had a<br>violent quarrel just before his death. ‘How dare you come in with a hole<br>in your elbow?’ I said. ‘Go away, you scamp!’ He turned and went out,<br>and never came again. I didn’t tell Marfa Petrovna at the time. I wanted<br>to have a service sung for him, but I was ashamed.”<br><br>“You should go to a doctor.”<br><br>“I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I don’t know<br>what’s wrong; I believe I am five times as strong as you are. I didn’t<br>ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you<br>believe that they exist.”<br><br>“No, I won’t believe it!” Raskolnikov cried, with positive anger.<br><br>“What do people generally say?” muttered Svidrigaïlov, as though<br>speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head. “They say, ‘You<br>are ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.’ But that’s not<br>strictly logical. I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that<br>only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that<br>they don’t exist.”<br><br>“Nothing of the sort,” Raskolnikov insisted irritably.<br><br>“No? You don’t think so?” Svidrigaïlov went on, looking at him<br>deliberately. “But what do you say to this argument (help me with<br>it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the<br>beginning of them. A man in health has, of course, no reason to see<br>them, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the<br>sake of completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon<br>as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is<br>broken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the<br>more seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one’s contact with that<br>other world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that<br>world. I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you<br>could believe in that, too.”<br><br>“I don’t believe in a future life,” said Raskolnikov.<br><br>Svidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.<br><br>“And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,”<br> he said suddenly.<br><br>“He is a madman,” thought Raskolnikov.<br><br>“We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception,<br>something vast, vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that, what<br>if it’s one little room, like a bath house in the country, black<br>and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that’s all eternity is? I<br>sometimes fancy it like that.”<br><br>“Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than<br>that?” Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish.<br><br>“Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know<br>it’s what I would certainly have made it,” answered Svidrigaïlov, with a<br>vague smile.<br><br>This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov. Svidrigaïlov<br>raised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing.<br><br>“Only think,” he cried, “half an hour ago we had never seen each other,<br>we regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between<br>us; we’ve thrown it aside, and away we’ve gone into the abstract! Wasn’t<br>I right in saying that we were birds of a feather?”<br><br>“Kindly allow me,” Raskolnikov went on irritably, “to ask you to explain<br>why you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry,<br>I have no time to waste. I want to go out.”<br><br>“By all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to<br>be married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?”<br><br>“Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning<br>her name? I can’t understand how you dare utter her name in my presence,<br>if you really are Svidrigaïlov.”<br><br>“Why, but I’ve come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioning<br>her?”<br><br>“Very good, speak, but make haste.”<br><br>“I am sure that you must have formed your own opinion of this Mr.<br>Luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only<br>seen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him. He is no<br>match for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing<br>herself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of<br>her family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very<br>glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly<br>advantages. Now I know you personally, I am convinced of it.”<br><br>“All this is very naïve... excuse me, I should have said impudent on<br>your part,” said Raskolnikov.<br><br>“You mean to say that I am seeking my own ends. Don’t be uneasy, Rodion<br>Romanovitch, if I were working for my own advantage, I would not have<br>spoken out so directly. I am not quite a fool. I will confess something<br>psychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for<br>Avdotya Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim. Well, let me tell you<br>that I’ve no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that I wonder<br>myself indeed, for I really did feel something...”<br><br>“Through idleness and depravity,” Raskolnikov put in.<br><br>“I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities<br>that even I could not help being impressed by them. But that’s all<br>nonsense, as I see myself now.”<br><br>“Have you seen that long?”<br><br>“I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the<br>day before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. I<br>still fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya<br>Romanovna’s hand and to cut out Mr. Luzhin.”<br><br>“Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object<br>of your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to go out...”<br><br>“With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on a<br>certain... journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary<br>arrangements. I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided<br>for; and they have no need of me personally. And a nice father I should<br>make, too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year<br>ago. That’s enough for me. Excuse me, I am just coming to the point.<br>Before the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too.<br>It’s not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I quarrelled<br>with Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage.<br>I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if you<br>like in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she<br>will never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging<br>her pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten<br>thousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture to<br>which I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could see the way<br>to it.”<br><br>“You are certainly mad,” cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as<br>astonished. “How dare you talk like that!”<br><br>“I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, though I am not<br>rich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely no<br>need for it. If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it, I shall waste<br>it in some more foolish way. That’s the first thing. Secondly, my<br>conscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive.<br>You may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will<br>know. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, whom I<br>greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely<br>regretting it, I want--not to compensate, not to repay her for the<br>unpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to show<br>that I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm. If there<br>were a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not<br>have made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousand<br>only, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I may, perhaps,<br>very soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion<br>of any design on Avdotya Romanovna. In conclusion, let me say that<br>in marrying Mr. Luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from<br>another man. Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it over coolly<br>and quietly.”<br><br>Svidrigaïlov himself was exceedingly cool and quiet as he was saying<br>this.<br><br>“I beg you to say no more,” said Raskolnikov. “In any case this is<br>unpardonable impertinence.”<br><br>“Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour<br>in this world, and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good<br>by trivial conventional formalities. That’s absurd. If I died, for<br>instance, and left that sum to your sister in my will, surely she<br>wouldn’t refuse it?”<br><br>“Very likely she would.”<br><br>“Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though ten<br>thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion. In any case I<br>beg you to repeat what I have said to Avdotya Romanovna.”<br><br>“No, I won’t.”<br><br>“In that case, Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be obliged to try and see her<br>myself and worry her by doing so.”<br><br>“And if I do tell her, will you not try to see her?”<br><br>“I don’t know really what to say. I should like very much to see her<br>once more.”<br><br>“Don’t hope for it.”<br><br>“I’m sorry. But you don’t know me. Perhaps we may become better<br>friends.”<br><br>“You think we may become friends?”<br><br>“And why not?” Svidrigaïlov said, smiling. He stood up and took his hat.<br>“I didn’t quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning<br>on it... though I was very much struck by your face this morning.”<br><br>“Where did you see me this morning?” Raskolnikov asked uneasily.<br><br>“I saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is something about you<br>like me.... But don’t be uneasy. I am not intrusive; I used to get on<br>all right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great<br>personage who is a distant relation of mine, and I could write about<br>Raphael’s _Madonna_ in Madam Prilukov’s album, and I never left Marfa<br>Petrovna’s side for seven years, and I used to stay the night at<br>Viazemsky’s house in the Hay Market in the old days, and I may go up in<br>a balloon with Berg, perhaps.”<br><br>“Oh, all right. Are you starting soon on your travels, may I ask?”<br><br>“What travels?”<br><br>“Why, on that ‘journey’; you spoke of it yourself.”<br><br>“A journey? Oh, yes. I did speak of a journey. Well, that’s a wide<br>subject.... if only you knew what you are asking,” he added, and gave<br>a sudden, loud, short laugh. “Perhaps I’ll get married instead of the<br>journey. They’re making a match for me.”<br><br>“Here?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“How have you had time for that?”<br><br>“But I am very anxious to see Avdotya Romanovna once. I earnestly beg<br>it. Well, good-bye for the present. Oh, yes. I have forgotten something.<br>Tell your sister, Rodion Romanovitch, that Marfa Petrovna remembered<br>her in her will and left her three thousand roubles. That’s absolutely<br>certain. Marfa Petrovna arranged it a week before her death, and it was<br>done in my presence. Avdotya Romanovna will be able to receive the money<br>in two or three weeks.”<br><br>“Are you telling the truth?”<br><br>“Yes, tell her. Well, your servant. I am staying very near you.”<br><br>As he went out, Svidrigaïlov ran up against Razumihin in the doorway.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>It was nearly eight o’clock. The two young men hurried to Bakaleyev’s,<br>to arrive before Luzhin.<br><br>“Why, who was that?” asked Razumihin, as soon as they were in the<br>street.<br><br>“It was Svidrigaïlov, that landowner in whose house my sister was<br>insulted when she was their governess. Through his persecuting her with<br>his attentions, she was turned out by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. This<br>Marfa Petrovna begged Dounia’s forgiveness afterwards, and she’s just<br>died suddenly. It was of her we were talking this morning. I don’t<br>know why I’m afraid of that man. He came here at once after his wife’s<br>funeral. He is very strange, and is determined on doing something.... We<br>must guard Dounia from him... that’s what I wanted to tell you, do you<br>hear?”<br><br>“Guard her! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanovna? Thank you, Rodya,<br>for speaking to me like that.... We will, we will guard her. Where does<br>he live?”<br><br>“I don’t know.”<br><br>“Why didn’t you ask? What a pity! I’ll find out, though.”<br><br>“Did you see him?” asked Raskolnikov after a pause.<br><br>“Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well.”<br><br>“You did really see him? You saw him clearly?” Raskolnikov insisted.<br><br>“Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a thousand; I have<br>a good memory for faces.”<br><br>They were silent again.<br><br>“Hm!... that’s all right,” muttered Raskolnikov. “Do you know, I<br>fancied... I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination.”<br><br>“What do you mean? I don’t understand you.”<br><br>“Well, you all say,” Raskolnikov went on, twisting his mouth into a<br>smile, “that I am mad. I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad,<br>and have only seen a phantom.”<br><br>“What do you mean?”<br><br>“Why, who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad, and perhaps everything that<br>happened all these days may be only imagination.”<br><br>“Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again!... But what did he say, what did<br>he come for?”<br><br>Raskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a minute.<br><br>“Now let me tell you my story,” he began, “I came to you, you were<br>asleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry’s, Zametov was<br>still with him. I tried to begin, but it was no use. I couldn’t speak in<br>the right way. They don’t seem to understand and can’t understand, but<br>are not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking<br>to him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At<br>last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I’d<br>brain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away. That was<br>all. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didn’t say a word. But, you see, I<br>thought I’d made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea<br>struck me: why should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger<br>or anything, but why need you care? You needn’t care a hang for them. We<br>shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I’d<br>mystify them more than ever. How ashamed they’ll be afterwards! Hang<br>them! We can thrash them afterwards, but let’s laugh at them now!”<br><br>“To be sure,” answered Raskolnikov. “But what will you say to-morrow?”<br> he thought to himself. Strange to say, till that moment it had never<br>occurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew. As he<br>thought it, Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin’s account of his visit<br>to Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and gone<br>since then.<br><br>In the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctually<br>at eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in<br>together without greeting or looking at one another. The young men<br>walked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a<br>little in the passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came<br>forward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her<br>brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with<br>redoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies. He looked, however, as though<br>he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make<br>them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Dounia<br>and Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.<br>Razumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin<br>was next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.<br><br>A moment’s silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a<br>cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of<br>a benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to<br>insist on an explanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to<br>keep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp<br>and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.<br>But he could not bring himself to do this. Besides, he could not endure<br>uncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so<br>openly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was<br>better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and<br>there would always be time for that.<br><br>“I trust you had a favourable journey,” he inquired officially of<br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna.<br><br>“Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch.”<br><br>“I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued<br>either?”<br><br>“I am young and strong, I don’t get tired, but it was a great strain for<br>mother,” answered Dounia.<br><br>“That’s unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible length.<br>‘Mother Russia,’ as they say, is a vast country.... In spite of all my<br>desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday. But I trust all<br>passed off without inconvenience?”<br><br>“Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening,” Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, “and if<br>Dmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us, I really believe by God Himself,<br>we should have been utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri Prokofitch<br>Razumihin,” she added, introducing him to Luzhin.<br><br>“I had the pleasure... yesterday,” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a<br>hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent.<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very<br>polite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who,<br>directly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and<br>become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.<br>Again all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya<br>Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin had<br>nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again.<br><br>“Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?” she began having recourse to<br>her leading item of conversation.<br><br>“To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, and I have come to<br>make you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov<br>set off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife’s funeral. So<br>at least I have excellent authority for believing.”<br><br>“To Petersburg? here?” Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.<br><br>“Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the<br>rapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it.”<br><br>“Good heavens! won’t he leave Dounia in peace even here?” cried<br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna.<br><br>“I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for<br>uneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting<br>into communication with him. For my part I am on my guard, and am now<br>discovering where he is lodging.”<br><br>“Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have<br>given me,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: “I’ve only seen him twice,<br>but I thought him terrible, terrible! I am convinced that he was the<br>cause of Marfa Petrovna’s death.”<br><br>“It’s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. I<br>do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of<br>events by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the<br>general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am<br>in agreement with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and<br>precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within<br>a very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any<br>pecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways. He is<br>the most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.<br>I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so<br>unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years<br>ago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely by her exertions<br>and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic<br>and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to<br>Siberia, was hushed up. That’s the sort of man he is, if you care to<br>know.”<br><br>“Good heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov listened<br>attentively.<br><br>“Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of<br>this?” Dounia asked sternly and emphatically.<br><br>“I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I must<br>observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.<br>There was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich,<br>a foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other<br>commissions, and with this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close<br>and mysterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living<br>with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than<br>fourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she<br>used to beat her mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging in<br>the garret. At the inquest the verdict was suicide. After the usual<br>proceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that<br>the child had been... cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov. It is true, this<br>was not clearly established, the information was given by another German<br>woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement<br>was actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna’s money and<br>exertions; it did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very<br>significant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were<br>with them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he<br>received six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom.”<br><br>“I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself.”<br><br>“Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him,<br>to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.<br>Svidrigaïlov.”<br><br>“I don’t know that,” answered Dounia, dryly. “I only heard a queer story<br>that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher,<br>the servants used to say, ‘he read himself silly,’ and that he hanged<br>himself partly on account of Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s mockery of him and not<br>his blows. When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they<br>were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for<br>Philip’s death.”<br><br>“I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his<br>defence all of a sudden,” Luzhin observed, twisting his lips into<br>an ambiguous smile, “there’s no doubt that he is an astute man, and<br>insinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has<br>died so strangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to be<br>of service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed<br>efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him. For my part it’s<br>my firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor’s prison again.<br>Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything<br>substantial on him, having regard for his children’s interests, and,<br>if she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency,<br>something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a<br>man of his habits.”<br><br>“Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,” said Dounia, “say no more of Mr.<br>Svidrigaïlov. It makes me miserable.”<br><br>“He has just been to see me,” said Raskolnikov, breaking his silence for<br>the first time.<br><br>There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him. Even Pyotr<br>Petrovitch was roused.<br><br>“An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, and<br>introduced himself,” Raskolnikov continued. “He was fairly cheerful<br>and at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He is<br>particularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at<br>which he asked me to assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and<br>he told me about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa<br>Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that<br>you can receive the money very shortly.”<br><br>“Thank God!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. “Pray for<br>her soul, Dounia!”<br><br>“It’s a fact!” broke from Luzhin.<br><br>“Tell us, what more?” Dounia urged Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was left to his<br>children who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere<br>not far from me, but where, I don’t know, I didn’t ask....”<br><br>“But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?” cried Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna in a fright. “Did he tell you?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“What was it?”<br><br>“I’ll tell you afterwards.”<br><br>Raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea.<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.<br><br>“I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be in<br>your way,” he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up.<br><br>“Don’t go, Pyotr Petrovitch,” said Dounia, “you intended to spend<br>the evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an<br>explanation with mother.”<br><br>“Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,” Pyotr Petrovitch answered<br>impressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat. “I<br>certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon<br>a very important point indeed. But as your brother cannot speak openly<br>in my presence of some proposals of Mr. Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not<br>desire and am not able to speak openly... in the presence of others...<br>of certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my most weighty<br>and urgent request has been disregarded....”<br><br>Assuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence.<br><br>“Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was<br>disregarded solely at my insistance,” said Dounia. “You wrote that you<br>had been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at<br>once, and you must be reconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you,<br>then he _should_ and _will_ apologise.”<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line.<br><br>“There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no goodwill can make us<br>forget. There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep;<br>and when it has been overstepped, there is no return.”<br><br>“That wasn’t what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia<br>interrupted with some impatience. “Please understand that our whole<br>future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as<br>soon as possible. I tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at<br>it in any other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this<br>business must be ended to-day, however hard that may be. I repeat that<br>if my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness.”<br><br>“I am surprised at your putting the question like that,” said Luzhin,<br>getting more and more irritated. “Esteeming, and so to say, adoring you,<br>I may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some member<br>of your family. Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I<br>cannot accept duties incompatible with...”<br><br>“Ah, don’t be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch,” Dounia<br>interrupted with feeling, “and be the sensible and generous man I have<br>always considered, and wish to consider, you to be. I’ve given you a<br>great promise, I am your betrothed. Trust me in this matter and, believe<br>me, I shall be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of<br>judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When I insisted<br>on his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I told<br>him nothing of what I meant to do. Understand that, if you are not<br>reconciled, I must choose between you--it must be either you or he. That<br>is how the question rests on your side and on his. I don’t want to be<br>mistaken in my choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off<br>with my brother, for my brother’s sake I must break off with you. I can<br>find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me, and I want to<br>know it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me,<br>whether you are the husband for me.”<br><br>“Avdotya Romanovna,” Luzhin declared huffily, “your words are of too<br>much consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in view<br>of the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you. To say<br>nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an<br>impertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to<br>me. You say ‘you or he,’ showing thereby of how little consequence I<br>am in your eyes... I cannot let this pass considering the relationship<br>and... the obligations existing between us.”<br><br>“What!” cried Dounia, flushing. “I set your interest beside all that has<br>hitherto been most precious in my life, what has made up the _whole_ of<br>my life, and here you are offended at my making too _little_ account of<br>you.”<br><br>Raskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, but Pyotr<br>Petrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary, at every word he<br>became more persistent and irritable, as though he relished it.<br><br>“Love for the future partner of your life, for your husband, ought to<br>outweigh your love for your brother,” he pronounced sententiously, “and<br>in any case I cannot be put on the same level.... Although I said so<br>emphatically that I would not speak openly in your brother’s presence,<br>nevertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary<br>explanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity.<br>Your son,” he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna, “yesterday in the<br>presence of Mr. Razsudkin (or... I think that’s it? excuse me I have<br>forgotten your surname,” he bowed politely to Razumihin) “insulted me by<br>misrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private conversation,<br>drinking coffee, that is, that marriage with a poor girl who has had<br>experience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of<br>view than with one who has lived in luxury, since it is more profitable<br>for the moral character. Your son intentionally exaggerated the<br>significance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing me of<br>malicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon your<br>correspondence with him. I shall consider myself happy, Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna, if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite<br>conclusion, and thereby considerately reassure me. Kindly let me know<br>in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion<br>Romanovitch.”<br><br>“I don’t remember,” faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. “I repeated them as<br>I understood them. I don’t know how Rodya repeated them to you, perhaps<br>he exaggerated.”<br><br>“He could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation.”<br><br>“Pyotr Petrovitch,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity, “the<br>proof that Dounia and I did not take your words in a very bad sense is<br>the fact that we are here.”<br><br>“Good, mother,” said Dounia approvingly.<br><br>“Then this is my fault again,” said Luzhin, aggrieved.<br><br>“Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you yourself have<br>just written what was false about him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna added,<br>gaining courage.<br><br>“I don’t remember writing anything false.”<br><br>“You wrote,” Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Luzhin, “that I<br>gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed, as was<br>the fact, but to his daughter (whom I had never seen till yesterday).<br>You wrote this to make dissension between me and my family, and for that<br>object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you<br>don’t know. All that is mean slander.”<br><br>“Excuse me, sir,” said Luzhin, quivering with fury. “I enlarged upon<br>your qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your<br>sister’s and mother’s inquiries, how I found you, and what impression<br>you made on me. As for what you’ve alluded to in my letter, be so good<br>as to point out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn’t<br>throw away your money, and that there are not worthless persons in that<br>family, however unfortunate.”<br><br>“To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth the little<br>finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones.”<br><br>“Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and<br>sister?”<br><br>“I have done so already, if you care to know. I made her sit down to-day<br>with mother and Dounia.”<br><br>“Rodya!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Dounia crimsoned, Razumihin<br>knitted his brows. Luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm.<br><br>“You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna,” he said, “whether it is<br>possible for us to agree. I hope now that this question is at an end,<br>once and for all. I will withdraw, that I may not hinder the pleasures<br>of family intimacy, and the discussion of secrets.” He got up from his<br>chair and took his hat. “But in withdrawing, I venture to request<br>that for the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so to<br>say, compromises. I appeal particularly to you, honoured Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter was addressed to<br>you and to no one else.”<br><br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended.<br><br>“You seem to think we are completely under your authority, Pyotr<br>Petrovitch. Dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded,<br>she had the best intentions. And indeed you write as though you were<br>laying commands upon me. Are we to consider every desire of yours as<br>a command? Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show<br>particular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we have thrown<br>up everything, and have come here relying on you, and so we are in any<br>case in a sense in your hands.”<br><br>“That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, especially at the<br>present moment, when the news has come of Marfa Petrovna’s legacy, which<br>seems indeed very apropos, judging from the new tone you take to me,” he<br>added sarcastically.<br><br>“Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume that you were<br>reckoning on our helplessness,” Dounia observed irritably.<br><br>“But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I particularly desire<br>not to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of Arkady<br>Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov, which he has entrusted to your brother and<br>which have, I perceive, a great and possibly a very agreeable interest<br>for you.”<br><br>“Good heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.<br><br>Razumihin could not sit still on his chair.<br><br>“Aren’t you ashamed now, sister?” asked Raskolnikov.<br><br>“I am ashamed, Rodya,” said Dounia. “Pyotr Petrovitch, go away,” she<br>turned to him, white with anger.<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion.<br>He had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in the<br>helplessness of his victims. He could not believe it even now. He turned<br>pale, and his lips quivered.<br><br>“Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after such a<br>dismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never come back. Consider<br>what you are doing. My word is not to be shaken.”<br><br>“What insolence!” cried Dounia, springing up from her seat. “I don’t<br>want you to come back again.”<br><br>“What! So that’s how it stands!” cried Luzhin, utterly unable to the<br>last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of<br>his reckoning now. “So that’s how it stands! But do you know, Avdotya<br>Romanovna, that I might protest?”<br><br>“What right have you to speak to her like that?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna<br>intervened hotly. “And what can you protest about? What rights have you?<br>Am I to give my Dounia to a man like you? Go away, leave us altogether!<br>We are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action, and I above<br>all....”<br><br>“But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna,” Luzhin stormed in a<br>frenzy, “by your promise, and now you deny it and... besides... I have<br>been led on account of that into expenses....”<br><br>This last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch, that<br>Raskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it,<br>could not help breaking into laughter. But Pulcheria Alexandrovna was<br>furious.<br><br>“Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking of our trunk? But the<br>conductor brought it for nothing for you. Mercy on us, we have bound<br>you! What are you thinking about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us,<br>hand and foot, not we!”<br><br>“Enough, mother, no more please,” Avdotya Romanovna implored. “Pyotr<br>Petrovitch, do be kind and go!”<br><br>“I am going, but one last word,” he said, quite unable to control<br>himself. “Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up my<br>mind to take you, so to speak, after the gossip of the town had spread<br>all over the district in regard to your reputation. Disregarding public<br>opinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation, I certainly<br>might very well reckon on a fitting return, and might indeed look for<br>gratitude on your part. And my eyes have only now been opened! I see<br>myself that I may have acted very, very recklessly in disregarding the<br>universal verdict....”<br><br>“Does the fellow want his head smashed?” cried Razumihin, jumping up.<br><br>“You are a mean and spiteful man!” cried Dounia.<br><br>“Not a word! Not a movement!” cried Raskolnikov, holding Razumihin back;<br>then going close up to Luzhin, “Kindly leave the room!” he said quietly<br>and distinctly, “and not a word more or...”<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that<br>worked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man<br>carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against<br>Raskolnikov. Him, and him alone, he blamed for everything. It is<br>noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case<br>was perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were<br>concerned, all might “very well indeed” be set right again.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>The fact was that up to the last moment he had never expected such an<br>ending; he had been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that<br>two destitute and defenceless women could escape from his control. This<br>conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit to<br>the point of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up from<br>insignificance, was morbidly given to self-admiration, had the highest<br>opinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes even gloated<br>in solitude over his image in the glass. But what he loved and valued<br>above all was the money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts<br>of devices: that money made him the equal of all who had been his<br>superiors.<br><br>When he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had decided to take her in<br>spite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity<br>and had, indeed, felt genuinely indignant at such “black ingratitude.”<br> And yet, when he made Dounia his offer, he was fully aware of the<br>groundlessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere<br>contradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbelieved by all the<br>townspeople, who were warm in Dounia’a defence. And he would not have<br>denied that he knew all that at the time. Yet he still thought highly<br>of his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as<br>something heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret<br>feeling he cherished and admired, and he could not understand that<br>others should fail to admire it too. He had called on Raskolnikov with<br>the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good<br>deeds and to hear agreeable flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he<br>considered himself most undeservedly injured and unrecognised.<br><br>Dounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable.<br>For many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had<br>gone on waiting and amassing money. He brooded with relish, in profound<br>secret, over the image of a girl--virtuous, poor (she must be poor),<br>very young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one<br>who had suffered much, and was completely humbled before him, one who<br>would all her life look on him as her saviour, worship him, admire him<br>and only him. How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imagined<br>on this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over! And,<br>behold, the dream of so many years was all but realised; the beauty and<br>education of Avdotya Romanovna had impressed him; her helpless position<br>had been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he<br>dreamed of. Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education<br>and breeding superior to his own (he felt that), and this creature would<br>be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, and<br>would humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute,<br>unbounded power over her!... Not long before, he had, too, after long<br>reflection and hesitation, made an important change in his career and<br>was now entering on a wider circle of business. With this change his<br>cherished dreams of rising into a higher class of society seemed likely<br>to be realised.... He was, in fact, determined to try his fortune<br>in Petersburg. He knew that women could do a very great deal. The<br>fascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make<br>his way easier, might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwing<br>an aureole round him, and now everything was in ruins! This sudden<br>horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a<br>hideous joke, an absurdity. He had only been a tiny bit masterful,<br>had not even time to speak out, had simply made a joke, been carried<br>away--and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did love<br>Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams--and all<br>at once! No! The next day, the very next day, it must all be set right,<br>smoothed over, settled. Above all he must crush that conceited milksop<br>who was the cause of it all. With a sick feeling he could not help<br>recalling Razumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score;<br>as though a fellow like that could be put on a level with him! The man<br>he really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov.... He had, in short, a<br>great deal to attend to....<br><br>*****<br><br>“No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!” said Dounia, kissing and<br>embracing her mother. “I was tempted by his money, but on my honour,<br>brother, I had no idea he was such a base man. If I had seen through him<br>before, nothing would have tempted me! Don’t blame me, brother!”<br><br>“God has delivered us! God has delivered us!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna<br>muttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise what<br>had happened.<br><br>They were all relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing. Only now<br>and then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed.<br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna was surprised to find that she, too, was glad:<br>she had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible<br>misfortune. Razumihin was delighted. He did not yet dare to express his<br>joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as though a ton-weight<br>had fallen off his heart. Now he had the right to devote his life to<br>them, to serve them.... Anything might happen now! But he felt afraid to<br>think of further possibilities and dared not let his imagination<br>range. But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and<br>indifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on getting rid of<br>Luzhin, he seemed now the least concerned at what had happened. Dounia<br>could not help thinking that he was still angry with her, and Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna watched him timidly.<br><br>“What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?” said Dounia, approaching him.<br><br>“Yes, yes!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.<br><br>Raskolnikov raised his head.<br><br>“He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires<br>to see you once in my presence.”<br><br>“See her! On no account!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. “And how dare he<br>offer her money!”<br><br>Then Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversation with<br>Svidrigaïlov, omitting his account of the ghostly visitations of Marfa<br>Petrovna, wishing to avoid all unnecessary talk.<br><br>“What answer did you give him?” asked Dounia.<br><br>“At first I said I would not take any message to you. Then he said that<br>he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without my help.<br>He assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he<br>has no feeling for you. He doesn’t want you to marry Luzhin.... His talk<br>was altogether rather muddled.”<br><br>“How do you explain him to yourself, Rodya? How did he strike you?”<br><br>“I must confess I don’t quite understand him. He offers you ten<br>thousand, and yet says he is not well off. He says he is going away, and<br>in ten minutes he forgets he has said it. Then he says he is going to be<br>married and has already fixed on the girl.... No doubt he has a motive,<br>and probably a bad one. But it’s odd that he should be so clumsy about<br>it if he had any designs against you.... Of course, I refused this<br>money on your account, once for all. Altogether, I thought him very<br>strange.... One might almost think he was mad. But I may be mistaken;<br>that may only be the part he assumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems<br>to have made a great impression on him.”<br><br>“God rest her soul,” exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. “I shall always,<br>always pray for her! Where should we be now, Dounia, without this three<br>thousand! It’s as though it had fallen from heaven! Why, Rodya, this<br>morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were<br>just planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man<br>until he offered help.”<br><br>Dounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov’s offer. She still<br>stood meditating.<br><br>“He has got some terrible plan,” she said in a half whisper to herself,<br>almost shuddering.<br><br>Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.<br><br>“I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again,” he said to<br>Dounia.<br><br>“We will watch him! I will track him out!” cried Razumihin, vigorously.<br>“I won’t lose sight of him. Rodya has given me leave. He said to me<br>himself just now. ‘Take care of my sister.’ Will you give me leave, too,<br>Avdotya Romanovna?”<br><br>Dounia smiled and held out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not<br>leave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her timidly, but the<br>three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her.<br><br>A quarter of an hour later, they were all engaged in a lively<br>conversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for some time,<br>though he did not talk. Razumihin was the speaker.<br><br>“And why, why should you go away?” he flowed on ecstatically. “And what<br>are you to do in a little town? The great thing is, you are all here<br>together and you need one another--you do need one another, believe me.<br>For a time, anyway.... Take me into partnership, and I assure you we’ll<br>plan a capital enterprise. Listen! I’ll explain it all in detail to<br>you, the whole project! It all flashed into my head this morning,<br>before anything had happened... I tell you what; I have an uncle, I must<br>introduce him to you (a most accommodating and respectable old man).<br>This uncle has got a capital of a thousand roubles, and he lives on his<br>pension and has no need of that money. For the last two years he has<br>been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent.<br>interest. I know what that means; he simply wants to help me. Last year<br>I had no need of it, but this year I resolved to borrow it as soon as<br>he arrived. Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have<br>enough for a start, so we’ll go into partnership, and what are we going<br>to do?”<br><br>Then Razumihin began to unfold his project, and he explained at length<br>that almost all our publishers and booksellers know nothing at all<br>of what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad<br>publishers, and that any decent publications pay as a rule and give<br>a profit, sometimes a considerable one. Razumihin had, indeed, been<br>dreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years he had<br>been working in publishers’ offices, and knew three European languages<br>well, though he had told Raskolnikov six days before that he was<br>“schwach” in German with an object of persuading him to take half his<br>translation and half the payment for it. He had told a lie then, and<br>Raskolnikov knew he was lying.<br><br>“Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief<br>means of success--money of our own!” cried Razumihin warmly. “Of course<br>there will be a lot of work, but we will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna,<br>I, Rodion.... You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And<br>the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants<br>translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at<br>once. I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two years<br>I’ve been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every<br>detail of their business. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe<br>me! And why, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I know--and I kept<br>the secret--two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles<br>simply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed, and I would<br>not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them. And what do you<br>think? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he’d hesitate--they are<br>such blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling,<br>you trust to me, I know my way about. We’ll begin in a small way and go<br>on to a large. In any case it will get us our living and we shall get<br>back our capital.”<br><br>Dounia’s eyes shone.<br><br>“I like what you are saying, Dmitri Prokofitch!” she said.<br><br>“I know nothing about it, of course,” put in Pulcheria Alexandrovna,<br>“it may be a good idea, but again God knows. It’s new and untried. Of<br>course, we must remain here at least for a time.” She looked at Rodya.<br><br>“What do you think, brother?” said Dounia.<br><br>“I think he’s got a very good idea,” he answered. “Of course, it’s too<br>soon to dream of a publishing firm, but we certainly might bring out<br>five or six books and be sure of success. I know of one book myself<br>which would be sure to go well. And as for his being able to manage it,<br>there’s no doubt about that either. He knows the business.... But we can<br>talk it over later....”<br><br>“Hurrah!” cried Razumihin. “Now, stay, there’s a flat here in this<br>house, belonging to the same owner. It’s a special flat apart, not<br>communicating with these lodgings. It’s furnished, rent moderate,<br>three rooms. Suppose you take them to begin with. I’ll pawn your watch<br>to-morrow and bring you the money, and everything can be arranged then.<br>You can all three live together, and Rodya will be with you. But where<br>are you off to, Rodya?”<br><br>“What, Rodya, you are going already?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in<br>dismay.<br><br>“At such a minute?” cried Razumihin.<br><br>Dounia looked at her brother with incredulous wonder. He held his cap in<br>his hand, he was preparing to leave them.<br><br>“One would think you were burying me or saying good-bye for ever,” he<br>said somewhat oddly. He attempted to smile, but it did not turn out a<br>smile. “But who knows, perhaps it is the last time we shall see each<br>other...” he let slip accidentally. It was what he was thinking, and it<br>somehow was uttered aloud.<br><br>“What is the matter with you?” cried his mother.<br><br>“Where are you going, Rodya?” asked Dounia rather strangely.<br><br>“Oh, I’m quite obliged to...” he answered vaguely, as though hesitating<br>what he would say. But there was a look of sharp determination in his<br>white face.<br><br>“I meant to say... as I was coming here... I meant to tell you, mother,<br>and you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time. I<br>feel ill, I am not at peace.... I will come afterwards, I will come of<br>myself... when it’s possible. I remember you and love you.... Leave me,<br>leave me alone. I decided this even before... I’m absolutely resolved on<br>it. Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, I want to be<br>alone. Forget me altogether, it’s better. Don’t inquire about me. When<br>I can, I’ll come of myself or... I’ll send for you. Perhaps it will all<br>come back, but now if you love me, give me up... else I shall begin to<br>hate you, I feel it.... Good-bye!”<br><br>“Good God!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Both his mother and his sister<br>were terribly alarmed. Razumihin was also.<br><br>“Rodya, Rodya, be reconciled with us! Let us be as before!” cried his<br>poor mother.<br><br>He turned slowly to the door and slowly went out of the room. Dounia<br>overtook him.<br><br>“Brother, what are you doing to mother?” she whispered, her eyes<br>flashing with indignation.<br><br>He looked dully at her.<br><br>“No matter, I shall come.... I’m coming,” he muttered in an undertone,<br>as though not fully conscious of what he was saying, and he went out of<br>the room.<br><br>“Wicked, heartless egoist!” cried Dounia.<br><br>“He is insane, but not heartless. He is mad! Don’t you see it? You’re<br>heartless after that!” Razumihin whispered in her ear, squeezing<br>her hand tightly. “I shall be back directly,” he shouted to the<br>horror-stricken mother, and he ran out of the room.<br><br>Raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the passage.<br><br>“I knew you would run after me,” he said. “Go back to them--be with<br>them... be with them to-morrow and always.... I... perhaps I shall<br>come... if I can. Good-bye.”<br><br>And without holding out his hand he walked away.<br><br>“But where are you going? What are you doing? What’s the matter with<br>you? How can you go on like this?” Razumihin muttered, at his wits’ end.<br><br>Raskolnikov stopped once more.<br><br>“Once for all, never ask me about anything. I have nothing to tell you.<br>Don’t come to see me. Maybe I’ll come here.... Leave me, but _don’t<br>leave_ them. Do you understand me?”<br><br>It was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp. For a<br>minute they were looking at one another in silence. Razumihin remembered<br>that minute all his life. Raskolnikov’s burning and intent eyes<br>grew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into his<br>consciousness. Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange, as it<br>were, passed between them.... Some idea, some hint, as it were, slipped,<br>something awful, hideous, and suddenly understood on both sides....<br>Razumihin turned pale.<br><br>“Do you understand now?” said Raskolnikov, his face twitching nervously.<br>“Go back, go to them,” he said suddenly, and turning quickly, he went<br>out of the house.<br><br>I will not attempt to describe how Razumihin went back to the ladies,<br>how he soothed them, how he protested that Rodya needed rest in his<br>illness, protested that Rodya was sure to come, that he would come every<br>day, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated,<br>that he, Razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, the<br>best doctor, a consultation.... In fact from that evening Razumihin took<br>his place with them as a son and a brother.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia<br>lived. It was an old green house of three storeys. He found the<br>porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of<br>Kapernaumov, the tailor. Having found in the corner of the courtyard<br>the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second<br>floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey<br>over the yard. While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where<br>to turn for Kapernaumov’s door, a door opened three paces from him; he<br>mechanically took hold of it.<br><br>“Who is there?” a woman’s voice asked uneasily.<br><br>“It’s I... come to see you,” answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the<br>tiny entry.<br><br>On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.<br><br>“It’s you! Good heavens!” cried Sonia weakly, and she stood rooted to<br>the spot.<br><br>“Which is your room? This way?” and Raskolnikov, trying not to look at<br>her, hastened in.<br><br>A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the<br>candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly<br>agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colour<br>rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... She<br>felt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly<br>and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance.<br><br>It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the<br>Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.<br>In the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always<br>kept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.<br>Sonia’s room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and<br>this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking<br>out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute<br>angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.<br>The other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any<br>furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,<br>beside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by a<br>blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other<br>flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite<br>wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers<br>looking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in the<br>room. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the<br>corners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There<br>was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.<br><br>Sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and<br>unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble<br>with terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter<br>of her destinies.<br><br>“I am late.... It’s eleven, isn’t it?” he asked, still not lifting his<br>eyes.<br><br>“Yes,” muttered Sonia, “oh yes, it is,” she added, hastily, as though in<br>that lay her means of escape. “My landlady’s clock has just struck... I<br>heard it myself....”<br><br>“I’ve come to you for the last time,” Raskolnikov went on gloomily,<br>although this was the first time. “I may perhaps not see you again...”<br><br>“Are you... going away?”<br><br>“I don’t know... to-morrow....”<br><br>“Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?” Sonia’s voice<br>shook.<br><br>“I don’t know. I shall know to-morrow morning.... Never mind that: I’ve<br>come to say one word....”<br><br>He raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was<br>sitting down while she was all the while standing before him.<br><br>“Why are you standing? Sit down,” he said in a changed voice, gentle and<br>friendly.<br><br>She sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her.<br><br>“How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like a dead hand.”<br><br>He took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly.<br><br>“I have always been like that,” she said.<br><br>“Even when you lived at home?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“Of course, you were,” he added abruptly and the expression of his face<br>and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly.<br><br>He looked round him once more.<br><br>“You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?”<br><br>“Yes....”<br><br>“They live there, through that door?”<br><br>“Yes.... They have another room like this.”<br><br>“All in one room?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“I should be afraid in your room at night,” he observed gloomily.<br><br>“They are very good people, very kind,” answered Sonia, who still seemed<br>bewildered, “and all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs.<br>And they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me.”<br><br>“They all stammer, don’t they?”<br><br>“Yes.... He stammers and he’s lame. And his wife, too.... It’s not<br>exactly that she stammers, but she can’t speak plainly. She is a very<br>kind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are seven<br>children... and it’s only the eldest one that stammers and the others<br>are simply ill... but they don’t stammer.... But where did you hear<br>about them?” she added with some surprise.<br><br>“Your father told me, then. He told me all about you.... And how you<br>went out at six o’clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna<br>knelt down by your bed.”<br><br>Sonia was confused.<br><br>“I fancied I saw him to-day,” she whispered hesitatingly.<br><br>“Whom?”<br><br>“Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten<br>o’clock and he seemed to be walking in front. It looked just like him. I<br>wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna....”<br><br>“You were walking in the streets?”<br><br>“Yes,” Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and<br>looking down.<br><br>“Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?”<br><br>“Oh no, what are you saying? No!” Sonia looked at him almost with<br>dismay.<br><br>“You love her, then?”<br><br>“Love her? Of course!” said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she<br>clasped her hands in distress. “Ah, you don’t.... If you only knew!<br>You see, she is quite like a child.... Her mind is quite unhinged, you<br>see... from sorrow. And how clever she used to be... how generous... how<br>kind! Ah, you don’t understand, you don’t understand!”<br><br>Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement<br>and distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in<br>her eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that<br>she was longing to speak, to champion, to express something. A sort<br>of _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in<br>every feature of her face.<br><br>“Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did beat me,<br>what then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is so<br>unhappy... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She is seeking righteousness,<br>she is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousness<br>everywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her, she<br>wouldn’t do wrong. She doesn’t see that it’s impossible for people to<br>be righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She is<br>good!”<br><br>“And what will happen to you?”<br><br>Sonia looked at him inquiringly.<br><br>“They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your hands<br>before, though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well,<br>how will it be now?”<br><br>“I don’t know,” Sonia articulated mournfully.<br><br>“Will they stay there?”<br><br>“I don’t know.... They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady,<br>I hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and Katerina<br>Ivanovna says that she won’t stay another minute.”<br><br>“How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?”<br><br>“Oh, no, don’t talk like that.... We are one, we live like one.” Sonia<br>was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other<br>little bird were to be angry. “And what could she do? What, what could<br>she do?” she persisted, getting hot and excited. “And how she cried<br>to-day! Her mind is unhinged, haven’t you noticed it? At one minute she<br>is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the<br>lunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood,<br>weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the<br>wall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her<br>hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will<br>borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and<br>set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to<br>superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses<br>and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in<br>her fancies! One can’t contradict her. And all the day long she has been<br>washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with<br>her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went this<br>morning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are<br>quite worn out. Only the money we’d reckoned wasn’t enough, not nearly<br>enough. And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste,<br>you don’t know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before the<br>shopmen because she hadn’t enough.... Ah, it was sad to see her....”<br><br>“Well, after that I can understand your living like this,” Raskolnikov<br>said with a bitter smile.<br><br>“And aren’t you sorry for them? Aren’t you sorry?” Sonia flew at him<br>again. “Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you’d<br>seen nothing of it, and if you’d seen everything, oh dear! And how<br>often, how often I’ve brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only<br>a week before his death. I was cruel! And how often I’ve done it! Ah,<br>I’ve been wretched at the thought of it all day!”<br><br>Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.<br><br>“You were cruel?”<br><br>“Yes, I--I. I went to see them,” she went on, weeping, “and father said,<br>‘read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here’s a book.’ He<br>had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives<br>there, he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said, ‘I<br>can’t stay,’ as I didn’t want to read, and I’d gone in chiefly to show<br>Katerina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some<br>collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. Katerina<br>Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself<br>in the glass and was delighted with them. ‘Make me a present of them,<br>Sonia,’ she said, ‘please do.’ ‘_Please do_,’ she said, she wanted them<br>so much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her old<br>happy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she<br>has no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn’t had all these years!<br>And she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she’d sooner give<br>away everything. And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I<br>was sorry to give them. ‘What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?’ I<br>said. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! She gave<br>me such a look. And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.<br>And it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars,<br>but for my refusing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back,<br>change it, take back those words! Ah, if I... but it’s nothing to you!”<br><br>“Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?”<br><br>“Yes.... Did you know her?” Sonia asked with some surprise.<br><br>“Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon<br>die,” said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question.<br><br>“Oh, no, no, no!”<br><br>And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploring<br>that she should not.<br><br>“But it will be better if she does die.”<br><br>“No, not better, not at all better!” Sonia unconsciously repeated in<br>dismay.<br><br>“And the children? What can you do except take them to live with you?”<br><br>“Oh, I don’t know,” cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she put her<br>hands to her head.<br><br>It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and<br>he had only roused it again.<br><br>“And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get ill<br>and are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?” he persisted<br>pitilessly.<br><br>“How can you? That cannot be!”<br><br>And Sonia’s face worked with awful terror.<br><br>“Cannot be?” Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. “You are not<br>insured against it, are you? What will happen to them then? They will<br>be in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head<br>against some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....<br>Then she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the<br>hospital, she will die, and the children...”<br><br>“Oh, no.... God will not let it be!” broke at last from Sonia’s<br>overburdened bosom.<br><br>She listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb<br>entreaty, as though it all depended upon him.<br><br>Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed.<br>Sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible<br>dejection.<br><br>“And can’t you save? Put by for a rainy day?” he asked, stopping<br>suddenly before her.<br><br>“No,” whispered Sonia.<br><br>“Of course not. Have you tried?” he added almost ironically.<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“And it didn’t come off! Of course not! No need to ask.”<br><br>And again he paced the room. Another minute passed.<br><br>“You don’t get money every day?”<br><br>Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.<br><br>“No,” she whispered with a painful effort.<br><br>“It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt,” he said suddenly.<br><br>“No, no! It can’t be, no!” Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though<br>she had been stabbed. “God would not allow anything so awful!”<br><br>“He lets others come to it.”<br><br>“No, no! God will protect her, God!” she repeated beside herself.<br><br>“But, perhaps, there is no God at all,” Raskolnikov answered with a sort<br>of malignance, laughed and looked at her.<br><br>Sonia’s face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked at<br>him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not<br>speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands.<br><br>“You say Katerina Ivanovna’s mind is unhinged; your own mind is<br>unhinged,” he said after a brief silence.<br><br>Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not<br>looking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put<br>his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful<br>face. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were<br>twitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the<br>ground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And<br>certainly he looked like a madman.<br><br>“What are you doing to me?” she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden<br>anguish clutched at her heart.<br><br>He stood up at once.<br><br>“I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of<br>humanity,” he said wildly and walked away to the window. “Listen,” he<br>added, turning to her a minute later. “I said just now to an insolent<br>man that he was not worth your little finger... and that I did my sister<br>honour making her sit beside you.”<br><br>“Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?” cried Sonia,<br>frightened. “Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I’m... dishonourable....<br>Ah, why did you say that?”<br><br>“It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you,<br>but because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that’s<br>true,” he added almost solemnly, “and your worst sin is that you have<br>destroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_. Isn’t that fearful? Isn’t<br>it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at<br>the same time you know yourself (you’ve only to open your eyes) that you<br>are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything? Tell me,”<br> he went on almost in a frenzy, “how this shame and degradation can exist<br>in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be<br>better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end<br>it all!”<br><br>“But what would become of them?” Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with<br>eyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.<br><br>Raskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so she<br>must have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly<br>she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that<br>now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed<br>the cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and his<br>peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either,<br>and that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thought<br>of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long<br>tortured her. “What, what,” he thought, “could hitherto have hindered<br>her from putting an end to it?” Only then he realised what those poor<br>little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna,<br>knocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia.<br><br>But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and<br>the amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any<br>case remain so. He was still confronted by the question, how could she<br>have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind,<br>since she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course he<br>knew that Sonia’s position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not<br>unique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her<br>tinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought,<br>have killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her<br>up--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched<br>her mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her<br>heart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him....<br><br>“There are three ways before her,” he thought, “the canal, the madhouse,<br>or... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns<br>the heart to stone.”<br><br>The last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was<br>young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing<br>that the last end was the most likely.<br><br>“But can that be true?” he cried to himself. “Can that creature who has<br>still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last<br>into that sink of filth and iniquity? Can the process already have<br>begun? Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now,<br>because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannot<br>be!” he cried, as Sonia had just before. “No, what has kept her from the<br>canal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... And if she<br>has not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of her<br>mind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, can one reason as she does?<br>How can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she<br>is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she<br>expect a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn’t that all mean madness?”<br><br>He stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that explanation indeed<br>better than any other. He began looking more intently at her.<br><br>“So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?” he asked her.<br><br>Sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.<br><br>“What should I be without God?” she whispered rapidly, forcibly,<br>glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand.<br><br>“Ah, so that is it!” he thought.<br><br>“And what does God do for you?” he asked, probing her further.<br><br>Sonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer. Her weak<br>chest kept heaving with emotion.<br><br>“Be silent! Don’t ask! You don’t deserve!” she cried suddenly, looking<br>sternly and wrathfully at him.<br><br>“That’s it, that’s it,” he repeated to himself.<br><br>“He does everything,” she whispered quickly, looking down again.<br><br>“That’s the way out! That’s the explanation,” he decided, scrutinising<br>her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.<br>He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft<br>blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that<br>little body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed<br>to him more and more strange, almost impossible. “She is a religious<br>maniac!” he repeated to himself.<br><br>There was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had noticed it every<br>time he paced up and down the room. Now he took it up and looked at it.<br>It was the New Testament in the Russian translation. It was bound in<br>leather, old and worn.<br><br>“Where did you get that?” he called to her across the room.<br><br>She was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table.<br><br>“It was brought me,” she answered, as it were unwillingly, not looking<br>at him.<br><br>“Who brought it?”<br><br>“Lizaveta, I asked her for it.”<br><br>“Lizaveta! strange!” he thought.<br><br>Everything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every<br>moment. He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the<br>pages.<br><br>“Where is the story of Lazarus?” he asked suddenly.<br><br>Sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer. She was<br>standing sideways to the table.<br><br>“Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia.”<br><br>She stole a glance at him.<br><br>“You are not looking in the right place.... It’s in the fourth gospel,”<br> she whispered sternly, without looking at him.<br><br>“Find it and read it to me,” he said. He sat down with his elbow on the<br>table, leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to<br>listen.<br><br>“In three weeks’ time they’ll welcome me in the madhouse! I shall be<br>there if I am not in a worse place,” he muttered to himself.<br><br>Sonia heard Raskolnikov’s request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly<br>to the table. She took the book however.<br><br>“Haven’t you read it?” she asked, looking up at him across the table.<br><br>Her voice became sterner and sterner.<br><br>“Long ago.... When I was at school. Read!”<br><br>“And haven’t you heard it in church?”<br><br>“I... haven’t been. Do you often go?”<br><br>“N-no,” whispered Sonia.<br><br>Raskolnikov smiled.<br><br>“I understand.... And you won’t go to your father’s funeral to-morrow?”<br><br>“Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too... I had a requiem<br>service.”<br><br>“For whom?”<br><br>“For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe.”<br><br>His nerves were more and more strained. His head began to go round.<br><br>“Were you friends with Lizaveta?”<br><br>“Yes.... She was good... she used to come... not often... she<br>couldn’t.... We used to read together and... talk. She will see God.”<br><br>The last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here was something new<br>again: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them--religious<br>maniacs.<br><br>“I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! It’s infectious!”<br><br>“Read!” he cried irritably and insistently.<br><br>Sonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to read<br>to him. He looked almost with exasperation at the “unhappy lunatic.”<br><br>“What for? You don’t believe?...” she whispered softly and as it were<br>breathlessly.<br><br>“Read! I want you to,” he persisted. “You used to read to Lizaveta.”<br><br>Sonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, her<br>voice failed her. Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the<br>first syllable.<br><br>“Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany...” she forced<br>herself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an<br>overstrained string. There was a catch in her breath.<br><br>Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him<br>and the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on<br>her doing so. He understood only too well how painful it was for her<br>to betray and unveil all that was her _own_. He understood that these<br>feelings really were her _secret treasure_, which she had kept perhaps<br>for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy<br>father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of<br>starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the same<br>time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with<br>dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read<br>to _him_ that he might hear it, and to read _now_ whatever might come of<br>it!... He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion.<br>She mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on<br>reading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth<br>verse:<br><br>“And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning<br>their brother.<br><br>“Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met<br>Him: but Mary sat still in the house.<br><br>“Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother<br>had not died.<br><br>“But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give<br>it Thee....”<br><br>Then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would<br>quiver and break again.<br><br>“Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again.<br><br>“Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the<br>resurrection, at the last day.<br><br>“Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that<br>believeth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live.<br><br>“And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest<br>thou this?<br><br>“She saith unto Him,”<br><br>(And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as<br>though she were making a public confession of faith.)<br><br>“Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God Which<br>should come into the world.”<br><br>She stopped and looked up quickly at him, but controlling herself went<br>on reading. Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table and<br>his eyes turned away. She read to the thirty-second verse.<br><br>“Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at<br>His feet, saying unto Him, Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother had<br>not died.<br><br>“When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which<br>came with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled,<br><br>“And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, Lord, come and<br>see.<br><br>“Jesus wept.<br><br>“Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him!<br><br>“And some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of the<br>blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?”<br><br>Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. Yes, he had known it!<br>She was trembling in a real physical fever. He had expected it. She was<br>getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense<br>triumph came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy<br>gave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she knew what she<br>was reading by heart. At the last verse “Could not this Man which opened<br>the eyes of the blind...” dropping her voice she passionately reproduced<br>the doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who<br>in another moment would fall at His feet as though struck by<br>thunder, sobbing and believing.... “And _he, he_--too, is blinded and<br>unbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes! At<br>once, now,” was what she was dreaming, and she was quivering with happy<br>anticipation.<br><br>“Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a<br>cave, and a stone lay upon it.<br><br>“Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was<br>dead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath been<br>dead four days.”<br><br>She laid emphasis on the word _four_.<br><br>“Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest<br>believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?<br><br>“Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid.<br>And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou<br>hast heard Me.<br><br>“And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which<br>stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.<br><br>“And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come<br>forth.<br><br>“And he that was dead came forth.”<br><br>(She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she were<br>seeing it before her eyes.)<br><br>“Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about<br>with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him and let him go.<br><br>“Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which<br>Jesus did believed on Him.”<br><br>She could read no more, closed the book and got up from her chair<br>quickly.<br><br>“That is all about the raising of Lazarus,” she whispered severely and<br>abruptly, and turning away she stood motionless, not daring to raise<br>her eyes to him. She still trembled feverishly. The candle-end was<br>flickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in the<br>poverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely<br>been reading together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed.<br><br>“I came to speak of something,” Raskolnikov said aloud, frowning. He got<br>up and went to Sonia. She lifted her eyes to him in silence. His face<br>was particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in<br>it.<br><br>“I have abandoned my family to-day,” he said, “my mother and sister. I<br>am not going to see them. I’ve broken with them completely.”<br><br>“What for?” asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with his mother and<br>sister had left a great impression which she could not analyse. She<br>heard his news almost with horror.<br><br>“I have only you now,” he added. “Let us go together.... I’ve come to<br>you, we are both accursed, let us go our way together!”<br><br>His eyes glittered “as though he were mad,” Sonia thought, in her turn.<br><br>“Go where?” she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back.<br><br>“How do I know? I only know it’s the same road, I know that and nothing<br>more. It’s the same goal!”<br><br>She looked at him and understood nothing. She knew only that he was<br>terribly, infinitely unhappy.<br><br>“No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but I have<br>understood. I need you, that is why I have come to you.”<br><br>“I don’t understand,” whispered Sonia.<br><br>“You’ll understand later. Haven’t you done the same? You, too, have<br>transgressed... have had the strength to transgress. You have laid<br>hands on yourself, you have destroyed a life... _your own_ (it’s all the<br>same!). You might have lived in spirit and understanding, but you’ll<br>end in the Hay Market.... But you won’t be able to stand it, and if<br>you remain alone you’ll go out of your mind like me. You are like a mad<br>creature already. So we must go together on the same road! Let us go!”<br><br>“What for? What’s all this for?” said Sonia, strangely and violently<br>agitated by his words.<br><br>“What for? Because you can’t remain like this, that’s why! You must look<br>things straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry<br>that God won’t allow it. What will happen, if you should really be taken<br>to the hospital to-morrow? She is mad and in consumption, she’ll soon<br>die and the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka won’t come to<br>grief? Haven’t you seen children here at the street corners sent out<br>by their mothers to beg? I’ve found out where those mothers live and in<br>what surroundings. Children can’t remain children there! At seven the<br>child is vicious and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image of<br>Christ: ‘theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.’ He bade us honour and love<br>them, they are the humanity of the future....”<br><br>“What’s to be done, what’s to be done?” repeated Sonia, weeping<br>hysterically and wringing her hands.<br><br>“What’s to be done? Break what must be broken, once for all, that’s all,<br>and take the suffering on oneself. What, you don’t understand? You’ll<br>understand later.... Freedom and power, and above all, power! Over all<br>trembling creation and all the ant-heap!... That’s the goal, remember<br>that! That’s my farewell message. Perhaps it’s the last time I shall<br>speak to you. If I don’t come to-morrow, you’ll hear of it all, and then<br>remember these words. And some day later on, in years to come, you’ll<br>understand perhaps what they meant. If I come to-morrow, I’ll tell you<br>who killed Lizaveta.... Good-bye.”<br><br>Sonia started with terror.<br><br>“Why, do you know who killed her?” she asked, chilled with horror,<br>looking wildly at him.<br><br>“I know and will tell... you, only you. I have chosen you out. I’m not<br>coming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you. I chose you<br>out long ago to hear this, when your father talked of you and when<br>Lizaveta was alive, I thought of it. Good-bye, don’t shake hands.<br>To-morrow!”<br><br>He went out. Sonia gazed at him as at a madman. But she herself was like<br>one insane and felt it. Her head was going round.<br><br>“Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta? What did those<br>words mean? It’s awful!” But at the same time _the idea_ did not enter<br>her head, not for a moment! “Oh, he must be terribly unhappy!... He has<br>abandoned his mother and sister.... What for? What has happened? And<br>what had he in his mind? What did he say to her? He had kissed her foot<br>and said... said (yes, he had said it clearly) that he could not live<br>without her.... Oh, merciful heavens!”<br><br>Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She jumped up from<br>time to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish<br>sleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading<br>the gospel and him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing<br>her feet, weeping.<br><br>On the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia’s room<br>from Madame Resslich’s flat, was a room which had long stood empty. A<br>card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the<br>canal advertising it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the<br>room’s being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidrigaïlov had been<br>standing, listening at the door of the empty room. When Raskolnikov went<br>out he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own room<br>which adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it<br>to the door that led to Sonia’s room. The conversation had struck him<br>as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it--so much so<br>that he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, for<br>instance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but<br>might listen in comfort.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>When next morning at eleven o’clock punctually Raskolnikov went into the<br>department of the investigation of criminal causes and sent his name in<br>to Porfiry Petrovitch, he was surprised at being kept waiting so long:<br>it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned. He had expected<br>that they would pounce upon him. But he stood in the waiting-room, and<br>people, who apparently had nothing to do with him, were continually<br>passing to and fro before him. In the next room which looked like an<br>office, several clerks were sitting writing and obviously they had<br>no notion who or what Raskolnikov might be. He looked uneasily and<br>suspiciously about him to see whether there was not some guard, some<br>mysterious watch being kept on him to prevent his escape. But there was<br>nothing of the sort: he saw only the faces of clerks absorbed in petty<br>details, then other people, no one seemed to have any concern with him.<br>He might go where he liked for them. The conviction grew stronger in him<br>that if that enigmatic man of yesterday, that phantom sprung out of the<br>earth, had seen everything, they would not have let him stand and wait<br>like that. And would they have waited till he elected to appear at<br>eleven? Either the man had not yet given information, or... or simply<br>he knew nothing, had seen nothing (and how could he have seen anything?)<br>and so all that had happened to him the day before was again a phantom<br>exaggerated by his sick and overstrained imagination. This conjecture<br>had begun to grow strong the day before, in the midst of all his<br>alarm and despair. Thinking it all over now and preparing for a fresh<br>conflict, he was suddenly aware that he was trembling--and he felt a<br>rush of indignation at the thought that he was trembling with fear at<br>facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. What he dreaded above all was<br>meeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred<br>and was afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was such<br>that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and<br>arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible,<br>to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained<br>nerves. At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.<br><br>He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His study was a room<br>neither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that<br>stood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a<br>bookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture,<br>of polished yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door,<br>beyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov’s entrance<br>Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in<br>and they remained alone. He met his visitor with an apparently genial<br>and good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that<br>Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had<br>been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.<br><br>“Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are... in our domain”... began Porfiry,<br>holding out both hands to him. “Come, sit down, old man... or perhaps<br>you don’t like to be called ‘my dear fellow’ and ‘old man!’--_tout<br>court_? Please don’t think it too familiar.... Here, on the sofa.”<br><br>Raskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. “In our domain,”<br> the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase _tout court_, were all<br>characteristic signs.<br><br>“He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one--he drew it<br>back in time,” struck him suspiciously. Both were watching each other,<br>but when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away.<br><br>“I brought you this paper... about the watch. Here it is. Is it all<br>right or shall I copy it again?”<br><br>“What? A paper? Yes, yes, don’t be uneasy, it’s all right,” Porfiry<br>Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the<br>paper and looked at it. “Yes, it’s all right. Nothing more is needed,”<br> he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table.<br><br>A minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the<br>table and put it on his bureau.<br><br>“I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...<br>formally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?” Raskolnikov<br>was beginning again. “Why did I put in ‘I believe’” passed through<br>his mind in a flash. “Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘_I<br>believe_’?” came in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his<br>uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the<br>first looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that<br>this was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were quivering, his emotion was<br>increasing. “It’s bad, it’s bad! I shall say too much again.”<br><br>“Yes, yes, yes! There’s no hurry, there’s no hurry,” muttered Porfiry<br>Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim,<br>as it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table,<br>at one moment avoiding Raskolnikov’s suspicious glance, then again<br>standing still and looking him straight in the face.<br><br>His fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling<br>from one side to the other and rebounding back.<br><br>“We’ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a<br>cigarette!” he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. “You know I am<br>receiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my<br>government quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had to<br>have some repairs done here. It’s almost finished now.... Government<br>quarters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?”<br><br>“Yes, a capital thing,” answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almost<br>ironically.<br><br>“A capital thing, a capital thing,” repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as<br>though he had just thought of something quite different. “Yes, a capital<br>thing,” he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and<br>stopping short two steps from him.<br><br>This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the<br>serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.<br><br>But this stirred Raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever and he could not<br>resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge.<br><br>“Tell me, please,” he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him<br>and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. “I believe it’s a<br>sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating<br>lawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least<br>an irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man<br>they are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to<br>give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question. Isn’t<br>that so? It’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals<br>of the art?”<br><br>“Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government<br>quarters... eh?”<br><br>And as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked;<br>a good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face. The wrinkles on his<br>forehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened<br>and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all<br>over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter forced<br>himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was laughing,<br>broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov’s<br>repulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and<br>stared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his<br>intentionally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution on<br>both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in<br>his visitor’s face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with<br>which the visitor received it. The latter fact was very significant<br>in Raskolnikov’s eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been<br>embarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps<br>fallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here<br>unknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in<br>another moment would break upon him...<br><br>He went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his<br>cap.<br><br>“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began resolutely, though with considerable<br>irritation, “yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you<br>for some inquiries” (he laid special stress on the word “inquiries”). “I<br>have come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow<br>me to withdraw. I have no time to spare.... I have to be at the funeral<br>of that man who was run over, of whom you... know also,” he added,<br>feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at<br>his anger. “I am sick of it all, do you hear? and have long been. It’s<br>partly what made me ill. In short,” he shouted, feeling that the phrase<br>about his illness was still more out of place, “in short, kindly examine<br>me or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so in the<br>proper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile,<br>good-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now.”<br><br>“Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I question you about?”<br> cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off<br>laughing. “Please don’t disturb yourself,” he began fidgeting from place<br>to place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. “There’s no hurry,<br>there’s no hurry, it’s all nonsense. Oh, no, I’m very glad you’ve come<br>to see me at last... I look upon you simply as a visitor. And as for<br>my confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch. Rodion<br>Romanovitch? That is your name?... It’s my nerves, you tickled me<br>so with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with<br>laughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... I’m<br>often afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I<br>shall think you are angry...”<br><br>Raskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning<br>angrily. He did sit down, but still held his cap.<br><br>“I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch,”<br> Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding<br>his visitor’s eyes. “You see, I’m a bachelor, a man of no consequence<br>and not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, I’m set, I’m<br>running to seed and... and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in<br>our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but<br>respect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before<br>they can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sit<br>opposite each other and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of<br>conversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always have<br>their subjects of conversation, _c’est de rigueur_, but people of the<br>middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied<br>and awkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is the lack of public<br>interest, or whether it is we are so honest we don’t want to deceive one<br>another, I don’t know. What do you think? Do put down your cap, it<br>looks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable... I am so<br>delighted...”<br><br>Raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with<br>a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry<br>Petrovitch. “Does he really want to distract my attention with his silly<br>babble?”<br><br>“I can’t offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a<br>friend?” Porfiry pattered on, “and you know all these official<br>duties... please don’t mind my running up and down, excuse it, my dear<br>fellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is<br>absolutely indispensable for me. I’m always sitting and so glad to be<br>moving about for five minutes... I suffer from my sedentary life... I<br>always intend to join a gymnasium; they say that officials of all ranks,<br>even Privy Councillors, may be seen skipping gaily there; there you have<br>it, modern science... yes, yes.... But as for my duties here, inquiries<br>and all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now...<br>I assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for<br>the interrogator than for the interrogated.... You made the observation<br>yourself just now very aptly and wittily.” (Raskolnikov had made no<br>observation of the kind.) “One gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! One<br>keeps harping on the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and<br>we shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And as for<br>our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree<br>with you. Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that<br>they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily<br>put it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!--your felicitous<br>comparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by ‘government<br>quarters’... he-he! You are an ironical person. Come. I won’t go on! Ah,<br>by the way, yes! One word leads to another. You spoke of formality just<br>now, apropos of the inquiry, you know. But what’s the use of formality?<br>In many cases it’s nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets<br>a good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on formality, allow<br>me to assure you. And after all, what does it amount to? An examining<br>lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step. The work of<br>investigation is, so to speak, a free art in its own way, he-he-he!”<br><br>Porfiry Petrovitch took breath a moment. He had simply babbled on<br>uttering empty phrases, letting slip a few enigmatic words and again<br>reverting to incoherence. He was almost running about the room, moving<br>his fat little legs quicker and quicker, looking at the ground, with his<br>right hand behind his back, while with his left making gesticulations<br>that were extraordinarily incongruous with his words. Raskolnikov<br>suddenly noticed that as he ran about the room he seemed twice to stop<br>for a moment near the door, as though he were listening.<br><br>“Is he expecting anything?”<br><br>“You are certainly quite right about it,” Porfiry began gaily, looking<br>with extraordinary simplicity at Raskolnikov (which startled him and<br>instantly put him on his guard); “certainly quite right in laughing so<br>wittily at our legal forms, he-he! Some of these elaborate psychological<br>methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres<br>too closely to the forms. Yes... I am talking of forms again. Well, if<br>I recognise, or more strictly speaking, if I suspect someone or other to<br>be a criminal in any case entrusted to me... you’re reading for the law,<br>of course, Rodion Romanovitch?”<br><br>“Yes, I was...”<br><br>“Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future--though don’t<br>suppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish<br>about crime! No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if I<br>took this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry him<br>prematurely, even though I had evidence against him? In one case I may<br>be bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in<br>quite a different position, you know, so why shouldn’t I let him walk<br>about the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you don’t quite understand, so<br>I’ll give you a clearer example. If I put him in prison too soon, I<br>may very likely give him, so to speak, moral support, he-he! You’re<br>laughing?”<br><br>Raskolnikov had no idea of laughing. He was sitting with compressed<br>lips, his feverish eyes fixed on Porfiry Petrovitch’s.<br><br>“Yet that is the case, with some types especially, for men are so<br>different. You say ‘evidence’. Well, there may be evidence. But<br>evidence, you know, can generally be taken two ways. I am an examining<br>lawyer and a weak man, I confess it. I should like to make a proof, so<br>to say, mathematically clear. I should like to make a chain of evidence<br>such as twice two are four, it ought to be a direct, irrefutable proof!<br>And if I shut him up too soon--even though I might be convinced _he_<br>was the man, I should very likely be depriving myself of the means of<br>getting further evidence against him. And how? By giving him, so to<br>speak, a definite position, I shall put him out of suspense and set his<br>mind at rest, so that he will retreat into his shell. They say that at<br>Sevastopol, soon after Alma, the clever people were in a terrible fright<br>that the enemy would attack openly and take Sevastopol at once. But when<br>they saw that the enemy preferred a regular siege, they were delighted,<br>I am told and reassured, for the thing would drag on for two months at<br>least. You’re laughing, you don’t believe me again? Of course, you’re<br>right, too. You’re right, you’re right. These are special cases, I<br>admit. But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, the<br>general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended,<br>for which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at<br>all, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon<br>as it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and<br>sometimes a case unlike any that’s gone before. Very comic cases of that<br>sort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone, if I don’t touch<br>him and don’t worry him, but let him know or at least suspect every<br>moment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night, and<br>if he is in continual suspicion and terror, he’ll be bound to lose his<br>head. He’ll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it as<br>plain as twice two are four--it’s delightful. It may be so with a simple<br>peasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a<br>certain side, it’s a dead certainty. For, my dear fellow, it’s a very<br>important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated. And then<br>there are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they<br>are all sick, nervous and irritable!... And then how they all suffer<br>from spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us. And it’s<br>no anxiety to me, his running about the town free! Let him, let him walk<br>about for a bit! I know well enough that I’ve caught him and that he<br>won’t escape me. Where could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A<br>Pole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching<br>and have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of the country<br>perhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants.<br>A modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such<br>strangers as our peasants. He-he! But that’s all nonsense, and on<br>the surface. It’s not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is<br>_psychologically_ unable to escape me, he-he! What an expression!<br>Through a law of nature he can’t escape me if he had anywhere to go.<br>Have you seen a butterfly round a candle? That’s how he will keep<br>circling and circling round me. Freedom will lose its attractions. He’ll<br>begin to brood, he’ll weave a tangle round himself, he’ll worry himself<br>to death! What’s more he will provide me with a mathematical proof--if I<br>only give him long enough interval.... And he’ll keep circling round<br>me, getting nearer and nearer and then--flop! He’ll fly straight into my<br>mouth and I’ll swallow him, and that will be very amusing, he-he-he! You<br>don’t believe me?”<br><br>Raskolnikov made no reply; he sat pale and motionless, still gazing with<br>the same intensity into Porfiry’s face.<br><br>“It’s a lesson,” he thought, turning cold. “This is beyond the cat<br>playing with a mouse, like yesterday. He can’t be showing off his power<br>with no motive... prompting me; he is far too clever for that... he must<br>have another object. What is it? It’s all nonsense, my friend, you are<br>pretending, to scare me! You’ve no proofs and the man I saw had no<br>real existence. You simply want to make me lose my head, to work me up<br>beforehand and so to crush me. But you are wrong, you won’t do it! But<br>why give me such a hint? Is he reckoning on my shattered nerves? No, my<br>friend, you are wrong, you won’t do it even though you have some trap<br>for me... let us see what you have in store for me.”<br><br>And he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal. At times<br>he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. This anger was what he<br>dreaded from the beginning. He felt that his parched lips were flecked<br>with foam, his heart was throbbing. But he was still determined not to<br>speak till the right moment. He realised that this was the best<br>policy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would be<br>irritating his enemy by his silence and provoking him into speaking too<br>freely. Anyhow, this was what he hoped for.<br><br>“No, I see you don’t believe me, you think I am playing a harmless joke<br>on you,” Porfiry began again, getting more and more lively, chuckling<br>at every instant and again pacing round the room. “And to be sure you’re<br>right: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in<br>other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, excuse<br>an old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a man still young, so to<br>say, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like<br>all young people. Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and<br>that’s for all the world like the old Austrian _Hof-kriegsrath_, as<br>far as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they’d beaten<br>Napoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it<br>all out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, General Mack surrendered<br>with all his army, he-he-he! I see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are<br>laughing at a civilian like me, taking examples out of military history!<br>But I can’t help it, it’s my weakness. I am fond of military science.<br>And I’m ever so fond of reading all military histories. I’ve certainly<br>missed my proper career. I ought to have been in the army, upon my<br>word I ought. I shouldn’t have been a Napoleon, but I might have been a<br>major, he-he! Well, I’ll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about<br>this _special case_, I mean: actual fact and a man’s temperament, my<br>dear sir, are weighty matters and it’s astonishing how they sometimes<br>deceive the sharpest calculation! I--listen to an old man--am speaking<br>seriously, Rodion Romanovitch” (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who<br>was scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even<br>his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) “Moreover, I’m<br>a candid man... am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I fancy I<br>really am: I tell you these things for nothing and don’t even expect a<br>reward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid<br>thing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of<br>life, and what tricks it can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a<br>poor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he’s liable<br>to be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after<br>all! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal’s temperament, worse<br>luck for him! But young people carried away by their own wit don’t think<br>of that ‘when they overstep all obstacles,’ as you wittily and cleverly<br>expressed it yesterday. He will lie--that is, the man who is a _special<br>case_, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion;<br>you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at<br>the most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint. Of course<br>there may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he’s<br>given us the idea! He lied incomparably, but he didn’t reckon on his<br>temperament. That’s what betrays him! Another time he will be carried<br>away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he<br>will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will<br>be _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given us<br>an idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think<br>differently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like<br>that at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted,<br>speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of<br>allegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks why didn’t you take me long<br>ago? he-he-he! And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man,<br>the psychologist, the literary man. The temperament reflects everything<br>like a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are you so<br>pale, Rodion Romanovitch? Is the room stuffy? Shall I open the window?”<br><br>“Oh, don’t trouble, please,” cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly broke<br>into a laugh. “Please don’t trouble.”<br><br>Porfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed.<br>Raskolnikov got up from the sofa, abruptly checking his hysterical<br>laughter.<br><br>“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though<br>his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand. “I see clearly at last<br>that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister<br>Lizaveta. Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you<br>find that you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then<br>prosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered at to my<br>face and worried...”<br><br>His lips trembled, his eyes glowed with fury and he could not restrain<br>his voice.<br><br>“I won’t allow it!” he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table. “Do<br>you hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won’t allow it.”<br><br>“Good heavens! What does it mean?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparently<br>quite frightened. “Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is the<br>matter with you?”<br><br>“I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov shouted again.<br><br>“Hush, my dear man! They’ll hear and come in. Just think, what could we<br>say to them?” Porfiry Petrovitch whispered in horror, bringing his face<br>close to Raskolnikov’s.<br><br>“I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov repeated mechanically,<br>but he too spoke in a sudden whisper.<br><br>Porfiry turned quickly and ran to open the window.<br><br>“Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear fellow. You’re<br>ill!” and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a<br>decanter of water in the corner. “Come, drink a little,” he whispered,<br>rushing up to him with the decanter. “It will be sure to do you good.”<br><br>Porfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov<br>was silent and began looking at him with wild curiosity. He did not take<br>the water, however.<br><br>“Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, you’ll drive yourself out of your<br>mind, I assure you, ach, ach! Have some water, do drink a little.”<br><br>He forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to<br>his lips, but set it on the table again with disgust.<br><br>“Yes, you’ve had a little attack! You’ll bring back your illness again,<br>my dear fellow,” Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy,<br>though he still looked rather disconcerted. “Good heavens, you must<br>take more care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me<br>yesterday--I know, I know, I’ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they<br>made of it!... Good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d been. We<br>dined and he talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my hands<br>in despair! Did he come from you? But do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit<br>down!”<br><br>“No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,”<br> Raskolnikov answered sharply.<br><br>“You knew?”<br><br>“I knew. What of it?”<br><br>“Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you;<br>I know about everything. I know how you went _to take a flat_ at night<br>when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so<br>that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, I<br>understand your state of mind at that time... but you’ll drive yourself<br>mad like that, upon my word! You’ll lose your head! You’re full of<br>generous indignation at the wrongs you’ve received, first from destiny,<br>and then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to<br>another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because<br>you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That’s so, isn’t<br>it? I have guessed how you feel, haven’t I? Only in that way you’ll<br>lose your head and Razumihin’s, too; he’s too _good_ a man for such<br>a position, you must know that. You are ill and he is good and your<br>illness is infectious for him... I’ll tell you about it when you are<br>more yourself.... But do sit down, for goodness’ sake. Please rest, you<br>look shocking, do sit down.”<br><br>Raskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over. In<br>amazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who<br>still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.<br>But he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strange<br>inclination to believe. Porfiry’s unexpected words about the flat had<br>utterly overwhelmed him. “How can it be, he knows about the flat then,”<br> he thought suddenly, “and he tells it me himself!”<br><br>“Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a<br>case of morbid psychology,” Porfiry went on quickly. “A man confessed to<br>murder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he brought<br>forward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but<br>only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that<br>he had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it<br>got on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he<br>persuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court<br>of Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under<br>proper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dear<br>fellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse<br>to work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about<br>blood! I’ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man<br>is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the<br>same with bell-ringing.... It’s all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! You<br>have begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced<br>doctor, what’s the good of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You<br>were delirious when you did all this!”<br><br>For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.<br><br>“Is it possible, is it possible,” flashed through his mind, “that he is<br>still lying? He can’t be, he can’t be.” He rejected that idea, feeling<br>to what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that fury<br>might drive him mad.<br><br>“I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing,” he cried, straining<br>every faculty to penetrate Porfiry’s game, “I was quite myself, do you<br>hear?”<br><br>“Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious,<br>you were particularly emphatic about it! I understand all you can tell<br>me! A-ach!... Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you were<br>actually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business,<br>would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession<br>of your faculties? And so emphatically and persistently? Would it be<br>possible? Quite impossible, to my thinking. If you had anything on<br>your conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.<br>That’s so, isn’t it?”<br><br>There was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov drew back on<br>the sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at<br>him.<br><br>“Another thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he<br>came of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it! But you don’t<br>conceal it! You lay stress on his coming at your instigation.”<br><br>Raskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his back.<br><br>“You keep telling lies,” he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lips<br>into a sickly smile, “you are trying again to show that you know all<br>my game, that you know all I shall say beforehand,” he said, conscious<br>himself that he was not weighing his words as he ought. “You want to<br>frighten me... or you are simply laughing at me...”<br><br>He still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of<br>intense hatred in his eyes.<br><br>“You keep lying,” he said. “You know perfectly well that the best<br>policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... to<br>conceal as little as possible. I don’t believe you!”<br><br>“What a wily person you are!” Porfiry tittered, “there’s no catching<br>you; you’ve a perfect monomania. So you don’t believe me? But still you<br>do believe me, you believe a quarter; I’ll soon make you believe the<br>whole, because I have a sincere liking for you and genuinely wish you<br>good.”<br><br>Raskolnikov’s lips trembled.<br><br>“Yes, I do,” went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov’s arm genially, “you<br>must take care of your illness. Besides, your mother and sister are here<br>now; you must think of them. You must soothe and comfort them and you do<br>nothing but frighten them...”<br><br>“What has that to do with you? How do you know it? What concern is it of<br>yours? You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?”<br><br>“Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! You don’t<br>notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything. From<br>Razumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. No,<br>you interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your<br>suspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To return<br>to bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a<br>precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having),<br>and you see nothing in it! Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you,<br>should I have acted like that? No, I should first have disarmed your<br>suspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted<br>your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your<br>expression) saying: ‘And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or<br>nearly eleven at the murdered woman’s flat and why did you ring the bell<br>and why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the porters<br>to go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?’ That’s how<br>I ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to<br>have taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps<br>have arrested you, too... so I have no suspicion of you, since I have<br>not done that! But you can’t look at it normally and you see nothing, I<br>say again.”<br><br>Raskolnikov started so that Porfiry Petrovitch could not fail to<br>perceive it.<br><br>“You are lying all the while,” he cried, “I don’t know your object,<br>but you are lying. You did not speak like that just now and I cannot be<br>mistaken!”<br><br>“I am lying?” Porfiry repeated, apparently incensed, but preserving<br>a good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least<br>concerned at Raskolnikov’s opinion of him. “I am lying... but how did<br>I treat you just now, I, the examining lawyer? Prompting you and giving<br>you every means for your defence; illness, I said, delirium, injury,<br>melancholy and the police officers and all the rest of it? Ah! He-he-he!<br>Though, indeed, all those psychological means of defence are not very<br>reliable and cut both ways: illness, delirium, I don’t remember--that’s<br>all right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your delirium<br>were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others? There<br>may have been others, eh? He-he-he!”<br><br>Raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him.<br><br>“Briefly,” he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet and in so<br>doing pushing Porfiry back a little, “briefly, I want to know, do you<br>acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not? Tell me, Porfiry<br>Petrovitch, tell me once for all and make haste!”<br><br>“What a business I’m having with you!” cried Porfiry with a perfectly<br>good-humoured, sly and composed face. “And why do you want to know, why<br>do you want to know so much, since they haven’t begun to worry you? Why,<br>you are like a child asking for matches! And why are you so uneasy? Why<br>do you force yourself upon us, eh? He-he-he!”<br><br>“I repeat,” Raskolnikov cried furiously, “that I can’t put up with it!”<br><br>“With what? Uncertainty?” interrupted Porfiry.<br><br>“Don’t jeer at me! I won’t have it! I tell you I won’t have it. I can’t<br>and I won’t, do you hear, do you hear?” he shouted, bringing his fist<br>down on the table again.<br><br>“Hush! Hush! They’ll overhear! I warn you seriously, take care of<br>yourself. I am not joking,” Porfiry whispered, but this time there was<br>not the look of old womanish good nature and alarm in his face. Now<br>he was peremptory, stern, frowning and for once laying aside all<br>mystification.<br><br>But this was only for an instant. Raskolnikov, bewildered, suddenly fell<br>into actual frenzy, but, strange to say, he again obeyed the command to<br>speak quietly, though he was in a perfect paroxysm of fury.<br><br>“I will not allow myself to be tortured,” he whispered, instantly<br>recognising with hatred that he could not help obeying the command and<br>driven to even greater fury by the thought. “Arrest me, search me, but<br>kindly act in due form and don’t play with me! Don’t dare!”<br><br>“Don’t worry about the form,” Porfiry interrupted with the same sly<br>smile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov. “I invited<br>you to see me quite in a friendly way.”<br><br>“I don’t want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you hear? And, here,<br>I take my cap and go. What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?”<br><br>He took up his cap and went to the door.<br><br>“And won’t you see my little surprise?” chuckled Porfiry, again taking<br>him by the arm and stopping him at the door.<br><br>He seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened<br>Raskolnikov.<br><br>“What surprise?” he asked, standing still and looking at Porfiry in<br>alarm.<br><br>“My little surprise, it’s sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!”<br> (He pointed to the locked door.) “I locked him in that he should not<br>escape.”<br><br>“What is it? Where? What?...”<br><br>Raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it was<br>locked.<br><br>“It’s locked, here is the key!”<br><br>And he brought a key out of his pocket.<br><br>“You are lying,” roared Raskolnikov without restraint, “you lie, you<br>damned punchinello!” and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other<br>door, not at all alarmed.<br><br>“I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I may betray<br>myself to you...”<br><br>“Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear Rodion<br>Romanovitch. You are in a passion. Don’t shout, I shall call the<br>clerks.”<br><br>“You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and tried to work<br>me into a frenzy to make me betray myself, that was your object! Produce<br>your facts! I understand it all. You’ve no evidence, you have only<br>wretched rubbishly suspicions like Zametov’s! You knew my character, you<br>wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and<br>deputies.... Are you waiting for them? eh! What are you waiting for?<br>Where are they? Produce them?”<br><br>“Why deputies, my good man? What things people will imagine! And to do<br>so would not be acting in form as you say, you don’t know the business,<br>my dear fellow.... And there’s no escaping form, as you see,” Porfiry<br>muttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard.<br><br>“Ah, they’re coming,” cried Raskolnikov. “You’ve sent for them! You<br>expected them! Well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses,<br>what you like!... I am ready!”<br><br>But at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected<br>that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for<br>such a conclusion to their interview.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>When he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it.<br><br>The noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a<br>little.<br><br>“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. “Why, I gave orders...”<br><br>For an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were<br>several persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing<br>somebody back.<br><br>“What is it?” Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily.<br><br>“The prisoner Nikolay has been brought,” someone answered.<br><br>“He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! What’s he doing here?<br>How irregular!” cried Porfiry, rushing to the door.<br><br>“But he...” began the same voice, and suddenly ceased.<br><br>Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave<br>a violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.<br><br>This man’s appearance was at first sight very strange. He stared<br>straight before him, as though seeing nothing. There was a determined<br>gleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his<br>face, as though he were being led to the scaffold. His white lips were<br>faintly twitching.<br><br>He was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young,<br>slim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features. The man whom<br>he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing<br>him by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.<br><br>Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. Some of them<br>tried to get in. All this took place almost instantaneously.<br><br>“Go away, it’s too soon! Wait till you are sent for!... Why have you<br>brought him so soon?” Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed,<br>and as it were thrown out of his reckoning.<br><br>But Nikolay suddenly knelt down.<br><br>“What’s the matter?” cried Porfiry, surprised.<br><br>“I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,” Nikolay articulated<br>suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.<br><br>For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;<br>even the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and<br>stood immovable.<br><br>“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his momentary<br>stupefaction.<br><br>“I... am the murderer,” repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause.<br><br>“What... you... what... whom did you kill?” Porfiry Petrovitch was<br>obviously bewildered.<br><br>Nikolay again was silent for a moment.<br><br>“Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... with<br>an axe. Darkness came over me,” he added suddenly, and was again silent.<br><br>He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some<br>moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back<br>the uninvited spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door.<br>Then he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner,<br>staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,<br>looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and<br>seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.<br><br>“You’re in too great a hurry,” he shouted at him, almost angrily. “I<br>didn’t ask you what came over you.... Speak, did you kill them?”<br><br>“I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence,” Nikolay pronounced.<br><br>“Ach! What did you kill them with?”<br><br>“An axe. I had it ready.”<br><br>“Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?”<br><br>Nikolay did not understand the question.<br><br>“Did you do it alone?”<br><br>“Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it.”<br><br>“Don’t be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairs<br>like that at the time? The porters met you both!”<br><br>“It was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka,” Nikolay replied<br>hurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.<br><br>“I knew it!” cried Porfiry, with vexation. “It’s not his own tale he is<br>telling,” he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested<br>on Raskolnikov again.<br><br>He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had<br>forgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken aback.<br><br>“My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!” he flew up to him, “this won’t<br>do; I’m afraid you must go... it’s no good your staying... I will...<br>you see, what a surprise!... Good-bye!”<br><br>And taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.<br><br>“I suppose you didn’t expect it?” said Raskolnikov who, though he had<br>not yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage.<br><br>“You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your hand is<br>trembling! He-he!”<br><br>“You’re trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!”<br><br>“Yes, I am; I didn’t expect it.”<br><br>They were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to<br>be gone.<br><br>“And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to me?”<br> Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.<br><br>“Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are an ironical<br>person! Come, till we meet!”<br><br>“I believe we can say _good-bye_!”<br><br>“That’s in God’s hands,” muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile.<br><br>As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people<br>were looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house,<br>whom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood there<br>waiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of<br>Porfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the latter running<br>after him, out of breath.<br><br>“One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in God’s hands,<br>but as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask<br>you... so we shall meet again, shan’t we?”<br><br>And Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.<br><br>“Shan’t we?” he added again.<br><br>He seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out.<br><br>“You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed... I<br>lost my temper,” began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courage<br>that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.<br><br>“Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,” Porfiry replied, almost gleefully.<br>“I myself, too... I have a wicked temper, I admit it! But we shall meet<br>again. If it’s God’s will, we may see a great deal of one another.”<br><br>“And will get to know each other through and through?” added<br>Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Yes; know each other through and through,” assented Porfiry Petrovitch,<br>and he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. “Now<br>you’re going to a birthday party?”<br><br>“To a funeral.”<br><br>“Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get well.”<br><br>“I don’t know what to wish you,” said Raskolnikov, who had begun to<br>descend the stairs, but looked back again. “I should like to wish you<br>success, but your office is such a comical one.”<br><br>“Why comical?” Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but he seemed to<br>prick up his ears at this.<br><br>“Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay<br>psychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed! You must have<br>been at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and<br>now that he has confessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again. ‘You are<br>lying,’ you’ll say. ‘You are not the murderer! You can’t be! It’s not<br>your own tale you are telling!’ You must admit it’s a comical business!”<br><br>“He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was<br>not his own tale he was telling?”<br><br>“How could I help noticing it!”<br><br>“He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! You’ve really a<br>playful mind! And you always fasten on the comic side... he-he! They say<br>that was the marked characteristic of Gogol, among the writers.”<br><br>“Yes, of Gogol.”<br><br>“Yes, of Gogol.... I shall look forward to meeting you.”<br><br>“So shall I.”<br><br>Raskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered that<br>on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to<br>collect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he<br>was stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,<br>amazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay’s confession<br>was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him at<br>once, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they<br>would be after him again. Till then, at least, he was free and must do<br>something for himself, for the danger was imminent.<br><br>But how imminent? His position gradually became clear to him.<br>Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene with<br>Porfiry, he could not help shuddering again with horror. Of course,<br>he did not yet know all Porfiry’s aims, he could not see into all his<br>calculations. But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew<br>better than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry’s “lead” had been for<br>him. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,<br>circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first<br>glance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was<br>bound to win. There’s no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised<br>himself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was<br>nothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasn’t<br>he mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying to get at? Had he really some<br>surprise prepared for him? And what was it? Had he really been expecting<br>something or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for the<br>unexpected appearance of Nikolay?<br><br>Porfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course, he had risked<br>something in showing them--and if he had really had anything up his<br>sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too. What was<br>that “surprise”? Was it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have<br>concealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His<br>yesterday’s visitor? What had become of him? Where was he to-day? If<br>Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him....<br><br>He sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in<br>his hands. He was still shivering nervously. At last he got up, took his<br>cap, thought a minute, and went to the door.<br><br>He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might<br>consider himself out of danger. He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he<br>wanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna’s. He would be too late for<br>the funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner,<br>and there at once he would see Sonia.<br><br>He stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a<br>moment on to his lips.<br><br>“To-day! To-day,” he repeated to himself. “Yes, to-day! So it must<br>be....”<br><br>But as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself. He<br>started and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly, and there<br>suddenly appeared a figure--yesterday’s visitor _from underground_.<br><br>The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,<br>and took a step forward into the room. He was exactly the same as<br>yesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change<br>in his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put<br>his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have<br>looked exactly like a peasant woman.<br><br>“What do you want?” asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror. The man was<br>still silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touching<br>it with his finger.<br><br>“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.<br><br>“I have sinned,” the man articulated softly.<br><br>“How?”<br><br>“By evil thoughts.”<br><br>They looked at one another.<br><br>“I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go<br>to the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that they<br>let you go and took you for drunken. I was so vexed that I lost my<br>sleep. And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for<br>you....”<br><br>“Who came?” Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.<br><br>“I did, I’ve wronged you.”<br><br>“Then you come from that house?”<br><br>“I was standing at the gate with them... don’t you remember? We have<br>carried on our trade in that house for years past. We cure and prepare<br>hides, we take work home... most of all I was vexed....”<br><br>And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came<br>clearly before Raskolnikov’s mind; he recollected that there had<br>been several people there besides the porters, women among them.<br>He remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the<br>police-station. He could not recall the face of the speaker, and even<br>now he did not recognise it, but he remembered that he had turned round<br>and made him some answer....<br><br>So this was the solution of yesterday’s horror. The most awful thought<br>was that he had been actually almost lost, had almost done for himself<br>on account of such a _trivial_ circumstance. So this man could tell<br>nothing except his asking about the flat and the blood stains. So<br>Porfiry, too, had nothing but that _delirium_, no facts but this<br>_psychology_ which _cuts both ways_, nothing positive. So if no more<br>facts come to light (and they must not, they must not!) then... then<br>what can they do to him? How can they convict him, even if they arrest<br>him? And Porfiry then had only just heard about the flat and had not<br>known about it before.<br><br>“Was it you who told Porfiry... that I’d been there?” he cried, struck<br>by a sudden idea.<br><br>“What Porfiry?”<br><br>“The head of the detective department?”<br><br>“Yes. The porters did not go there, but I went.”<br><br>“To-day?”<br><br>“I got there two minutes before you. And I heard, I heard it all, how he<br>worried you.”<br><br>“Where? What? When?”<br><br>“Why, in the next room. I was sitting there all the time.”<br><br>“What? Why, then you were the surprise? But how could it happen? Upon my<br>word!”<br><br>“I saw that the porters did not want to do what I said,” began the man;<br>“for it’s too late, said they, and maybe he’ll be angry that we did not<br>come at the time. I was vexed and I lost my sleep, and I began making<br>inquiries. And finding out yesterday where to go, I went to-day. The<br>first time I went he wasn’t there, when I came an hour later he couldn’t<br>see me. I went the third time, and they showed me in. I informed him of<br>everything, just as it happened, and he began skipping about the room<br>and punching himself on the chest. ‘What do you scoundrels mean by it?<br>If I’d known about it I should have arrested him!’ Then he ran out,<br>called somebody and began talking to him in the corner, then he turned<br>to me, scolding and questioning me. He scolded me a great deal; and I<br>told him everything, and I told him that you didn’t dare to say a word<br>in answer to me yesterday and that you didn’t recognise me. And he<br>fell to running about again and kept hitting himself on the chest, and<br>getting angry and running about, and when you were announced he told<br>me to go into the next room. ‘Sit there a bit,’ he said. ‘Don’t move,<br>whatever you may hear.’ And he set a chair there for me and locked<br>me in. ‘Perhaps,’ he said, ‘I may call you.’ And when Nikolay’d been<br>brought he let me out as soon as you were gone. ‘I shall send for you<br>again and question you,’ he said.”<br><br>“And did he question Nikolay while you were there?”<br><br>“He got rid of me as he did of you, before he spoke to Nikolay.”<br><br>The man stood still, and again suddenly bowed down, touching the ground<br>with his finger.<br><br>“Forgive me for my evil thoughts, and my slander.”<br><br>“May God forgive you,” answered Raskolnikov.<br><br>And as he said this, the man bowed down again, but not to the ground,<br>turned slowly and went out of the room.<br><br>“It all cuts both ways, now it all cuts both ways,” repeated<br>Raskolnikov, and he went out more confident than ever.<br><br>“Now we’ll make a fight for it,” he said, with a malicious smile, as he<br>went down the stairs. His malice was aimed at himself; with shame and<br>contempt he recollected his “cowardice.”<br><br><br><br><br>PART V<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>The morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and<br>her mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.<br>Intensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept<br>as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before<br>fantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had been<br>gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch<br>immediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he had<br>jaundice. However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at<br>his noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of<br>late, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the<br>conviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better<br>one. But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned<br>aside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey<br>Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying.<br>That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his<br>young friend’s account. He had set down a good many points against him<br>of late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to<br>have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday’s interview.<br>That was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness<br>and irritability.... Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness<br>followed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case<br>in the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat<br>which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being<br>redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,<br>would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just<br>been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr<br>Petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In<br>the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the<br>instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the<br>flat.<br><br>“Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?” Pyotr<br>Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a<br>gleam of desperate hope. “Can all that be really so irrevocably over?<br>Is it no use to make another effort?” The thought of Dounia sent a<br>voluptuous pang through his heart. He endured anguish at that moment,<br>and if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it,<br>Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.<br><br>“It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,” he thought, as<br>he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov’s room, “and why on earth was I<br>such a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny<br>so that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!<br>foo! If I’d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau<br>and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and<br>all that sort of trash from Knopp’s and the English shop, my position<br>would have been better and... stronger! They could not have refused me<br>so easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return<br>money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to<br>do it! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man<br>who has hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... H’m! I’ve made a<br>blunder.”<br><br>And grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a<br>fool--but not aloud, of course.<br><br>He returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. The<br>preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna’s excited<br>his curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it the day before; he<br>fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own cares<br>he had paid no attention. Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy<br>laying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he<br>heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the<br>lodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead<br>man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of<br>his previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,<br>was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most<br>important of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with<br>great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was<br>very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;<br>she was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she<br>was proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he<br>went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov’s, somewhat thoughtful. He<br>had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.<br><br>Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude of<br>Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.<br>Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay<br>with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He<br>had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from<br>parsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard<br>of Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young<br>progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting<br>circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had<br>impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who<br>despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a<br>peculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not, of course, been able to form<br>even an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had<br>heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some<br>sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and<br>distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for<br>many years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown<br>up_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the<br>thought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of<br>this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before,<br>when he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases<br>in which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,<br>had been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal<br>for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious<br>trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the<br>subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to<br>anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of “our younger<br>generation.” He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before<br>his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current<br>phrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace<br>simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if he<br>had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it<br>would not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, the<br>systems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for<br>him. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what<br>was happening _here_. Had these people any power or not? Had he anything<br>to fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what<br>precisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up<br>to them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the<br>thing to do or not? Couldn’t he gain something through them? In fact<br>hundreds of questions presented themselves.<br><br>Andrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little man, with strangely<br>flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud. He was a clerk<br>and had almost always something wrong with his eyes. He was rather<br>soft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in<br>speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.<br>He was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did<br>not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch<br>really was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress<br>and “our younger generation” from enthusiasm. He was one of the numerous<br>and varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited,<br>half-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in<br>fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve,<br>however sincerely.<br><br>Though Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was beginning to<br>dislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on both sides unconsciously.<br>However simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr<br>Petrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that “he was<br>not the right sort of man.” He had tried expounding to him the system of<br>Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to<br>listen too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begun<br>instinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace<br>simpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of<br>any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up<br>third-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own<br>work of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he<br>would be to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr<br>Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest<br>praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance,<br>when Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to<br>the establishment of the new “commune,” or to abstain from christening<br>his future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a<br>month after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing<br>his own praises that he did not disdain even such virtues when they were<br>attributed to him.<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some<br>five-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over<br>bundles of notes. Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money<br>walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank<br>notes with indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have convinced<br>Pyotr Petrovitch that Andrey Semyonovitch could really look on the money<br>unmoved, and the latter, on his side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr<br>Petrovitch was capable of entertaining such an idea about him and<br>was, perhaps, glad of the opportunity of teasing his young friend by<br>reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them.<br><br>He found him incredibly inattentive and irritable, though he, Andrey<br>Semyonovitch, began enlarging on his favourite subject, the foundation<br>of a new special “commune.” The brief remarks that dropped from Pyotr<br>Petrovitch between the clicking of the beads on the reckoning frame<br>betrayed unmistakable and discourteous irony. But the “humane” Andrey<br>Semyonovitch ascribed Pyotr Petrovitch’s ill-humour to his recent breach<br>with Dounia and he was burning with impatience to discourse on that<br>theme. He had something progressive to say on the subject which<br>might console his worthy friend and “could not fail” to promote his<br>development.<br><br>“There is some sort of festivity being prepared at that... at the<br>widow’s, isn’t there?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked suddenly, interrupting<br>Andrey Semyonovitch at the most interesting passage.<br><br>“Why, don’t you know? Why, I was telling you last night what I think<br>about all such ceremonies. And she invited you too, I heard. You were<br>talking to her yesterday...”<br><br>“I should never have expected that beggarly fool would have spent on<br>this feast all the money she got from that other fool, Raskolnikov. I<br>was surprised just now as I came through at the preparations there, the<br>wines! Several people are invited. It’s beyond everything!” continued<br>Pyotr Petrovitch, who seemed to have some object in pursuing the<br>conversation. “What? You say I am asked too? When was that? I don’t<br>remember. But I shan’t go. Why should I? I only said a word to her in<br>passing yesterday of the possibility of her obtaining a year’s salary as<br>a destitute widow of a government clerk. I suppose she has invited me on<br>that account, hasn’t she? He-he-he!”<br><br>“I don’t intend to go either,” said Lebeziatnikov.<br><br>“I should think not, after giving her a thrashing! You might well<br>hesitate, he-he!”<br><br>“Who thrashed? Whom?” cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered and blushing.<br><br>“Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard so<br>yesterday... so that’s what your convictions amount to... and the woman<br>question, too, wasn’t quite sound, he-he-he!” and Pyotr Petrovitch, as<br>though comforted, went back to clicking his beads.<br><br>“It’s all slander and nonsense!” cried Lebeziatnikov, who was always<br>afraid of allusions to the subject. “It was not like that at all, it<br>was quite different. You’ve heard it wrong; it’s a libel. I was simply<br>defending myself. She rushed at me first with her nails, she pulled<br>out all my whiskers.... It’s permissable for anyone, I should hope,<br>to defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on<br>principle, for it’s an act of despotism. What was I to do? I simply<br>pushed her back.”<br><br>“He-he-he!” Luzhin went on laughing maliciously.<br><br>“You keep on like that because you are out of humour yourself.... But<br>that’s nonsense and it has nothing, nothing whatever to do with the<br>woman question! You don’t understand; I used to think, indeed, that<br>if women are equal to men in all respects, even in strength (as is<br>maintained now) there ought to be equality in that, too. Of course, I<br>reflected afterwards that such a question ought not really to arise,<br>for there ought not to be fighting and in the future society fighting is<br>unthinkable... and that it would be a queer thing to seek for equality<br>in fighting. I am not so stupid... though, of course, there is<br>fighting... there won’t be later, but at present there is... confound<br>it! How muddled one gets with you! It’s not on that account that I<br>am not going. I am not going on principle, not to take part in the<br>revolting convention of memorial dinners, that’s why! Though, of course,<br>one might go to laugh at it.... I am sorry there won’t be any priests at<br>it. I should certainly go if there were.”<br><br>“Then you would sit down at another man’s table and insult it and those<br>who invited you. Eh?”<br><br>“Certainly not insult, but protest. I should do it with a good object. I<br>might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda. It’s<br>a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the<br>more harshly, perhaps, the better. I might drop a seed, an idea.... And<br>something might grow up from that seed. How should I be insulting them?<br>They might be offended at first, but afterwards they’d see I’d done them<br>a service. You know, Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed<br>because when she left her family and... devoted... herself, she wrote to<br>her father and mother that she wouldn’t go on living conventionally and<br>was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh,<br>that she might have spared them and have written more kindly. I think<br>that’s all nonsense and there’s no need of softness; on the contrary,<br>what’s wanted is protest. Varents had been married seven years, she<br>abandoned her two children, she told her husband straight out in a<br>letter: ‘I have realised that I cannot be happy with you. I can never<br>forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there<br>is another organisation of society by means of the communities. I have<br>only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given<br>myself and with whom I am establishing a community. I speak plainly<br>because I consider it dishonest to deceive you. Do as you think best.<br>Do not hope to get me back, you are too late. I hope you will be happy.’<br>That’s how letters like that ought to be written!”<br><br>“Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage?”<br><br>“No, it’s only the second, really! But what if it were the fourth, what<br>if it were the fifteenth, that’s all nonsense! And if ever I regretted<br>the death of my father and mother, it is now, and I sometimes think<br>if my parents were living what a protest I would have aimed at them! I<br>would have done something on purpose... I would have shown them! I would<br>have astonished them! I am really sorry there is no one!”<br><br>“To surprise! He-he! Well, be that as you will,” Pyotr Petrovitch<br>interrupted, “but tell me this; do you know the dead man’s daughter, the<br>delicate-looking little thing? It’s true what they say about her, isn’t<br>it?”<br><br>“What of it? I think, that is, it is my own personal conviction that<br>this is the normal condition of women. Why not? I mean, _distinguons_.<br>In our present society it is not altogether normal, because it is<br>compulsory, but in the future society it will be perfectly normal,<br>because it will be voluntary. Even as it is, she was quite right: she<br>was suffering and that was her asset, so to speak, her capital which<br>she had a perfect right to dispose of. Of course, in the future<br>society there will be no need of assets, but her part will have another<br>significance, rational and in harmony with her environment. As to Sofya<br>Semyonovna personally, I regard her action as a vigorous protest against<br>the organisation of society, and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice<br>indeed when I look at her!”<br><br>“I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings.”<br><br>Lebeziatnikov was enraged.<br><br>“That’s another slander,” he yelled. “It was not so at all! That was all<br>Katerina Ivanovna’s invention, for she did not understand! And I never<br>made love to Sofya Semyonovna! I was simply developing her, entirely<br>disinterestedly, trying to rouse her to protest.... All I wanted was her<br>protest and Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!”<br><br>“Have you asked her to join your community?”<br><br>“You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me to tell<br>you. You don’t understand! There is no such rôle in a community. The<br>community is established that there should be no such rôles. In a<br>community, such a rôle is essentially transformed and what is stupid<br>here is sensible there, what, under present conditions, is unnatural<br>becomes perfectly natural in the community. It all depends on the<br>environment. It’s all the environment and man himself is nothing. And<br>I am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this day, which is a proof<br>that she never regarded me as having wronged her. I am trying now to<br>attract her to the community, but on quite, quite a different footing.<br>What are you laughing at? We are trying to establish a community of<br>our own, a special one, on a broader basis. We have gone further in our<br>convictions. We reject more! And meanwhile I’m still developing Sofya<br>Semyonovna. She has a beautiful, beautiful character!”<br><br>“And you take advantage of her fine character, eh? He-he!”<br><br>“No, no! Oh, no! On the contrary.”<br><br>“Oh, on the contrary! He-he-he! A queer thing to say!”<br><br>“Believe me! Why should I disguise it? In fact, I feel it strange myself<br>how timid, chaste and modern she is with me!”<br><br>“And you, of course, are developing her... he-he! trying to prove to her<br>that all that modesty is nonsense?”<br><br>“Not at all, not at all! How coarsely, how stupidly--excuse me saying<br>so--you misunderstand the word development! Good heavens, how... crude<br>you still are! We are striving for the freedom of women and you have<br>only one idea in your head.... Setting aside the general question<br>of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed<br>prejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because that’s for her<br>to decide. Of course if she were to tell me herself that she wanted me,<br>I should think myself very lucky, because I like the girl very much; but<br>as it is, no one has ever treated her more courteously than I, with more<br>respect for her dignity... I wait in hopes, that’s all!”<br><br>“You had much better make her a present of something. I bet you never<br>thought of that.”<br><br>“You don’t understand, as I’ve told you already! Of course, she is in<br>such a position, but it’s another question. Quite another question!<br>You simply despise her. Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider<br>deserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow<br>creature. You don’t know what a character she is! I am only sorry that<br>of late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used<br>to lend them to her. I am sorry, too, that with all the energy and<br>resolution in protesting--which she has already shown once--she has<br>little self-reliance, little, so to say, independence, so as to<br>break free from certain prejudices and certain foolish ideas. Yet she<br>thoroughly understands some questions, for instance about kissing of<br>hands, that is, that it’s an insult to a woman for a man to kiss her<br>hand, because it’s a sign of inequality. We had a debate about it and<br>I described it to her. She listened attentively to an account of the<br>workmen’s associations in France, too. Now I am explaining the question<br>of coming into the room in the future society.”<br><br>“And what’s that, pray?”<br><br>“We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of the community<br>the right to enter another member’s room, whether man or woman, at any<br>time... and we decided that he has!”<br><br>“It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!”<br><br>Lebeziatnikov was really angry.<br><br>“You are always thinking of something unpleasant,” he cried with<br>aversion. “Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was expounding our system, I<br>referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy! It’s always<br>a stumbling-block to people like you, they turn it into ridicule before<br>they understand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! I’ve often<br>maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till<br>he has a firm faith in the system. And tell me, please, what do you<br>find so shameful even in cesspools? I should be the first to be ready<br>to clean out any cesspool you like. And it’s not a question of<br>self-sacrifice, it’s simply work, honourable, useful work which is<br>as good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a<br>Pushkin, because it is more useful.”<br><br>“And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!”<br><br>“What do you mean by ‘more honourable’? I don’t understand such<br>expressions to describe human activity. ‘More honourable,’ ‘nobler’--all<br>those are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is<br>_of use_ to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: _useful_!<br>You can snigger as much as you like, but that’s so!”<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch laughed heartily. He had finished counting the money<br>and was putting it away. But some of the notes he left on the table. The<br>“cesspool question” had already been a subject of dispute between them.<br>What was absurd was that it made Lebeziatnikov really angry, while it<br>amused Luzhin and at that moment he particularly wanted to anger his<br>young friend.<br><br>“It’s your ill-luck yesterday that makes you so ill-humoured and<br>annoying,” blurted out Lebeziatnikov, who in spite of his “independence”<br> and his “protests” did not venture to oppose Pyotr Petrovitch and still<br>behaved to him with some of the respect habitual in earlier years.<br><br>“You’d better tell me this,” Pyotr Petrovitch interrupted with haughty<br>displeasure, “can you... or rather are you really friendly enough with<br>that young person to ask her to step in here for a minute? I think<br>they’ve all come back from the cemetery... I heard the sound of<br>steps... I want to see her, that young person.”<br><br>“What for?” Lebeziatnikov asked with surprise.<br><br>“Oh, I want to. I am leaving here to-day or to-morrow and therefore I<br>wanted to speak to her about... However, you may be present during the<br>interview. It’s better you should be, indeed. For there’s no knowing<br>what you might imagine.”<br><br>“I shan’t imagine anything. I only asked and, if you’ve anything to say<br>to her, nothing is easier than to call her in. I’ll go directly and you<br>may be sure I won’t be in your way.”<br><br>Five minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. She came in very<br>much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual. She was always shy in<br>such circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she had been as<br>a child and was even more so now.... Pyotr Petrovitch met her “politely<br>and affably,” but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in<br>his opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight<br>in dealing with a creature so young and so _interesting_ as she. He<br>hastened to “reassure” her and made her sit down facing him at the<br>table. Sonia sat down, looked about her--at Lebeziatnikov, at the notes<br>lying on the table and then again at Pyotr Petrovitch and her eyes<br>remained riveted on him. Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door. Pyotr<br>Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.<br><br>“Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come?” he asked him in a whisper.<br><br>“Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he is there. I saw him just come in....<br>Why?”<br><br>“Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave<br>me alone with this... young woman. I only want a few words with her,<br>but God knows what they may make of it. I shouldn’t like Raskolnikov to<br>repeat anything.... You understand what I mean?”<br><br>“I understand!” Lebeziatnikov saw the point. “Yes, you are right.... Of<br>course, I am convinced personally that you have no reason to be uneasy,<br>but... still, you are right. Certainly I’ll stay. I’ll stand here at the<br>window and not be in your way... I think you are right...”<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch returned to the sofa, sat down opposite Sonia, looked<br>attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified, even severe<br>expression, as much as to say, “don’t you make any mistake, madam.”<br> Sonia was overwhelmed with embarrassment.<br><br>“In the first place, Sofya Semyonovna, will you make my excuses to your<br>respected mamma.... That’s right, isn’t it? Katerina Ivanovna stands<br>in the place of a mother to you?” Pyotr Petrovitch began with great<br>dignity, though affably.<br><br>It was evident that his intentions were friendly.<br><br>“Quite so, yes; the place of a mother,” Sonia answered, timidly and<br>hurriedly.<br><br>“Then will you make my apologies to her? Through inevitable<br>circumstances I am forced to be absent and shall not be at the dinner in<br>spite of your mamma’s kind invitation.”<br><br>“Yes... I’ll tell her... at once.”<br><br>And Sonia hastily jumped up from her seat.<br><br>“Wait, that’s not all,” Pyotr Petrovitch detained her, smiling at her<br>simplicity and ignorance of good manners, “and you know me little, my<br>dear Sofya Semyonovna, if you suppose I would have ventured to trouble<br>a person like you for a matter of so little consequence affecting myself<br>only. I have another object.”<br><br>Sonia sat down hurriedly. Her eyes rested again for an instant on the<br>grey-and-rainbow-coloured notes that remained on the table, but she<br>quickly looked away and fixed her eyes on Pyotr Petrovitch. She felt it<br>horribly indecorous, especially for _her_, to look at another person’s<br>money. She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held<br>in his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a<br>yellow stone on his middle finger. But suddenly she looked away and, not<br>knowing where to turn, ended by staring Pyotr Petrovitch again straight<br>in the face. After a pause of still greater dignity he continued.<br><br>“I chanced yesterday in passing to exchange a couple of words with<br>Katerina Ivanovna, poor woman. That was sufficient to enable me to<br>ascertain that she is in a position--preternatural, if one may so<br>express it.”<br><br>“Yes... preternatural...” Sonia hurriedly assented.<br><br>“Or it would be simpler and more comprehensible to say, ill.”<br><br>“Yes, simpler and more comprehen... yes, ill.”<br><br>“Quite so. So then from a feeling of humanity and so to speak<br>compassion, I should be glad to be of service to her in any way,<br>foreseeing her unfortunate position. I believe the whole of this<br>poverty-stricken family depends now entirely on you?”<br><br>“Allow me to ask,” Sonia rose to her feet, “did you say something to her<br>yesterday of the possibility of a pension? Because she told me you had<br>undertaken to get her one. Was that true?”<br><br>“Not in the slightest, and indeed it’s an absurdity! I merely hinted at<br>her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had<br>died in the service--if only she has patronage... but apparently your<br>late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the<br>service at all of late. In fact, if there could be any hope, it would be<br>very ephemeral, because there would be no claim for assistance in<br>that case, far from it.... And she is dreaming of a pension already,<br>he-he-he!... A go-ahead lady!”<br><br>“Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believes<br>everything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is like<br>that... yes... You must excuse her,” said Sonia, and again she got up to<br>go.<br><br>“But you haven’t heard what I have to say.”<br><br>“No, I haven’t heard,” muttered Sonia.<br><br>“Then sit down.” She was terribly confused; she sat down again a third<br>time.<br><br>“Seeing her position with her unfortunate little ones, I should be glad,<br>as I have said before, so far as lies in my power, to be of service,<br>that is, so far as is in my power, not more. One might for instance get<br>up a subscription for her, or a lottery, something of the sort, such as<br>is always arranged in such cases by friends or even outsiders desirous<br>of assisting people. It was of that I intended to speak to you; it might<br>be done.”<br><br>“Yes, yes... God will repay you for it,” faltered Sonia, gazing intently<br>at Pyotr Petrovitch.<br><br>“It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might begin it to-day, we<br>will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak. Come<br>to me at seven o’clock. Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. But<br>there is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and<br>for which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here. In<br>my opinion money cannot be, indeed it’s unsafe to put it into Katerina<br>Ivanovna’s own hands. The dinner to-day is a proof of that. Though she<br>has not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well, boots<br>or shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even,<br>I believe, Madeira and... and coffee. I saw it as I passed through.<br>To-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won’t have a crust of<br>bread. It’s absurd, really, and so, to my thinking, a subscription ought<br>to be raised so that the unhappy widow should not know of the money, but<br>only you, for instance. Am I right?”<br><br>“I don’t know... this is only to-day, once in her life.... She was<br>so anxious to do honour, to celebrate the memory.... And she is very<br>sensible... but just as you think and I shall be very, very... they will<br>all be... and God will reward... and the orphans...”<br><br>Sonia burst into tears.<br><br>“Very well, then, keep it in mind; and now will you accept for the<br>benefit of your relation the small sum that I am able to spare, from me<br>personally. I am very anxious that my name should not be mentioned in<br>connection with it. Here... having so to speak anxieties of my own, I<br>cannot do more...”<br><br>And Pyotr Petrovitch held out to Sonia a ten-rouble note carefully<br>unfolded. Sonia took it, flushed crimson, jumped up, muttered something<br>and began taking leave. Pyotr Petrovitch accompanied her ceremoniously<br>to the door. She got out of the room at last, agitated and distressed,<br>and returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion.<br><br>All this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the<br>room, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone he<br>walked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.<br><br>“I heard and _saw_ everything,” he said, laying stress on the last verb.<br>“That is honourable, I mean to say, it’s humane! You wanted to avoid<br>gratitude, I saw! And although I cannot, I confess, in principle<br>sympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate the<br>evil but even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw your action with<br>pleasure--yes, yes, I like it.”<br><br>“That’s all nonsense,” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted,<br>looking carefully at Lebeziatnikov.<br><br>“No, it’s not nonsense! A man who has suffered distress and annoyance as<br>you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others,<br>such a man... even though he is making a social mistake--is still<br>deserving of respect! I did not expect it indeed of you, Pyotr<br>Petrovitch, especially as according to your ideas... oh, what a drawback<br>your ideas are to you! How distressed you are for instance by your<br>ill-luck yesterday,” cried the simple-hearted Lebeziatnikov, who felt<br>a return of affection for Pyotr Petrovitch. “And, what do you want with<br>marriage, with _legal_ marriage, my dear, noble Pyotr Petrovitch? Why do<br>you cling to this _legality_ of marriage? Well, you may beat me if you<br>like, but I am glad, positively glad it hasn’t come off, that you are<br>free, that you are not quite lost for humanity.... you see, I’ve spoken<br>my mind!”<br><br>“Because I don’t want in your free marriage to be made a fool of and<br>to bring up another man’s children, that’s why I want legal marriage,”<br> Luzhin replied in order to make some answer.<br><br>He seemed preoccupied by something.<br><br>“Children? You referred to children,” Lebeziatnikov started off like<br>a warhorse at the trumpet call. “Children are a social question and a<br>question of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has<br>another solution. Some refuse to have children altogether, because they<br>suggest the institution of the family. We’ll speak of children later,<br>but now as to the question of honour, I confess that’s my weak point.<br>That horrid, military, Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the<br>dictionary of the future. What does it mean indeed? It’s nonsense,<br>there will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the natural<br>consequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.<br>So that indeed it’s not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an<br>absurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of<br>it. I should say to my wife: ‘My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now<br>I respect you, for you’ve shown you can protest!’ You laugh! That’s<br>because you are incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confound<br>it all! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived<br>in a legal marriage, but it’s simply a despicable consequence of a<br>despicable position in which both are humiliated. When the deception is<br>open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it’s unthinkable.<br>Your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you<br>incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for<br>her new husband. Damn it all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married,<br>pfoo! I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, it’s just the same,<br>I should present my wife with a lover if she had not found one for<br>herself. ‘My dear,’ I should say, ‘I love you, but even more than that I<br>desire you to respect me. See!’ Am I not right?”<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch sniggered as he listened, but without much merriment.<br>He hardly heard it indeed. He was preoccupied with something else and<br>even Lebeziatnikov at last noticed it. Pyotr Petrovitch seemed excited<br>and rubbed his hands. Lebeziatnikov remembered all this and reflected<br>upon it afterwards.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the<br>idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna’s disordered brain.<br>Nearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov’s<br>funeral, were wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to<br>honour the memory of the deceased “suitably,” that all the lodgers,<br>and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know “that he was in no way their<br>inferior, and perhaps very much their superior,” and that no one had the<br>right “to turn up his nose at him.” Perhaps the chief element was that<br>peculiar “poor man’s pride,” which compels many poor people to spend<br>their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order<br>to do “like other people,” and not to “be looked down upon.” It is very<br>probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at<br>the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those<br>“wretched contemptible lodgers” that she knew “how to do things, how<br>to entertain” and that she had been brought up “in a genteel, she might<br>almost say aristocratic colonel’s family” and had not been meant for<br>sweeping floors and washing the children’s rags at night. Even the<br>poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these<br>paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible<br>nervous craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she<br>might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have<br>been broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will<br>could not be crushed. Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her<br>mind was unhinged. She could not be said to be insane, but for a year<br>past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.<br>The later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect the<br>intellect.<br><br>There was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine<br>there was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest<br>quality but in sufficient quantity. Besides the traditional rice and<br>honey, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of<br>pancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen. Two samovars were<br>boiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Katerina<br>Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help<br>of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been<br>stranded at Madame Lippevechsel’s. He promptly put himself at Katerina<br>Ivanovna’s disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before<br>running about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxious<br>that everyone should be aware of it. For every trifle he ran to Katerina<br>Ivanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called<br>her “_Pani_.” She was heartily sick of him before the end, though<br>she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this<br>“serviceable and magnanimous man.” It was one of Katerina Ivanovna’s<br>characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.<br>Her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she<br>would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance<br>and quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden she<br>would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the<br>person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring. She<br>was naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from<br>continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_<br>that all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the<br>peace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost<br>to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and<br>fancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against<br>the wall.<br><br>Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in<br>Katerina Ivanovna’s eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary<br>respect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart<br>and soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table,<br>to provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her<br>kitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone<br>herself to the cemetery. Everything had been well done. Even the<br>table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses<br>were, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers,<br>but the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna,<br>feeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and<br>a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some<br>pride. This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for<br>some reason: “as though the table could not have been laid except by<br>Amalia Ivanovna!” She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. “Could she<br>be stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of the house,<br>and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers! As a favour!<br>Fancy that! Katerina Ivanovna’s father who had been a colonel and almost<br>a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then<br>anyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been<br>allowed into the kitchen.”<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the<br>time and contented herself with treating her coldly, though she decided<br>inwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down<br>and set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she was<br>fancying herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that<br>hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except<br>the Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the<br>memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned<br>up, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober. The older<br>and more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.<br>Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most<br>respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna<br>had the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna,<br>Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous,<br>noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had<br>been a friend of her first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s<br>house, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her<br>a considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna<br>exalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior<br>motive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to<br>the consequence of the person praised. Probably “taking his cue” from<br>Luzhin, “that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up<br>either. What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kindness<br>and because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a<br>friend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him.”<br><br>Among those who failed to appear were “the genteel lady and her<br>old-maidish daughter,” who had only been lodgers in the house for the<br>last fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar<br>in Katerina Ivanovna’s room, especially when Marmeladov had come<br>back drunk. Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who,<br>quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole<br>family out of doors, had shouted at her that they “were not worth the<br>foot” of the honourable lodgers whom they were disturbing. Katerina<br>Ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, “whose<br>foot she was not worth,” and who had turned away haughtily when she<br>casually met them, so that they might know that “she was more noble in<br>her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice,” and might see<br>that she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed to<br>make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father’s<br>governorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly<br>stupid of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major (he<br>was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it<br>appeared that he had been “not himself” for the last two days. The party<br>consisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and<br>a greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt<br>abominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the<br>post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone<br>at Amalia Ivanovna’s.<br><br>A retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was<br>drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy--was without<br>a waistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without<br>even greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suit<br>appeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of<br>Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole brought<br>with him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna’s<br>and whom no one had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina<br>Ivanovna intensely. “For whom had they made all these preparations<br>then?” To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid<br>for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the<br>furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big<br>girl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like<br>well-bred children’s.<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with<br>increased dignity, and even haughtiness. She stared at some of them with<br>special severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. Rushing<br>to the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who<br>were absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the<br>latter promptly observed and resented. Such a beginning was no good omen<br>for the end. All were seated at last.<br><br>Raskolnikov came in almost at the moment of their return from the<br>cemetery. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly delighted to see him, in the<br>first place, because he was the one “educated visitor, and, as everyone<br>knew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university,” and<br>secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having<br>been unable to be at the funeral. She positively pounced upon him, and<br>made him sit on her left hand (Amalia Ivanovna was on her right). In<br>spite of her continual anxiety that the dishes should be passed round<br>correctly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising<br>cough which interrupted her every minute and seemed to have grown worse<br>during the last few days, she hastened to pour out in a half whisper to<br>Raskolnikov all her suppressed feelings and her just indignation at<br>the failure of the dinner, interspersing her remarks with lively and<br>uncontrollable laughter at the expense of her visitors and especially of<br>her landlady.<br><br>“It’s all that cuckoo’s fault! You know whom I mean? Her, her!” Katerina<br>Ivanovna nodded towards the landlady. “Look at her, she’s making round<br>eyes, she feels that we are talking about her and can’t understand.<br>Pfoo, the owl! Ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) And what does she put on that<br>cap for? (Cough-cough-cough.) Have you noticed that she wants everyone<br>to consider that she is patronising me and doing me an honour by being<br>here? I asked her like a sensible woman to invite people, especially<br>those who knew my late husband, and look at the set of fools she has<br>brought! The sweeps! Look at that one with the spotty face. And those<br>wretched Poles, ha-ha-ha! (Cough-cough-cough.) Not one of them has ever<br>poked his nose in here, I’ve never set eyes on them. What have they come<br>here for, I ask you? There they sit in a row. Hey, _pan_!” she cried<br>suddenly to one of them, “have you tasted the pancakes? Take some more!<br>Have some beer! Won’t you have some vodka? Look, he’s jumped up and is<br>making his bows, they must be quite starved, poor things. Never mind,<br>let them eat! They don’t make a noise, anyway, though I’m really afraid<br>for our landlady’s silver spoons... Amalia Ivanovna!” she addressed her<br>suddenly, almost aloud, “if your spoons should happen to be stolen,<br>I won’t be responsible, I warn you! Ha-ha-ha!” She laughed turning to<br>Raskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at her<br>sally. “She didn’t understand, she didn’t understand again! Look how<br>she sits with her mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new ribbons,<br>ha-ha-ha!”<br><br>Here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that<br>lasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead<br>and her handkerchief was stained with blood. She showed Raskolnikov<br>the blood in silence, and as soon as she could get her breath began<br>whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her<br>cheeks.<br><br>“Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, so to speak,<br>for inviting that lady and her daughter, you understand of whom I am<br>speaking? It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she<br>has managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, that<br>provincial nonentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and<br>has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the<br>government offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybody<br>knows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has<br>not even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners<br>required! I can’t understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But<br>where’s Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what is it,<br>Sonia, where have you been? It’s odd that even at your father’s funeral<br>you should be so unpunctual. Rodion Romanovitch, make room for her<br>beside you. That’s your place, Sonia... take what you like. Have some of<br>the cold entrée with jelly, that’s the best. They’ll bring the pancakes<br>directly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you got<br>everything? (Cough-cough-cough.) That’s all right. Be a good girl, Lida,<br>and, Kolya, don’t fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman.<br>What are you saying, Sonia?”<br><br>Sonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch’s apologies, trying to<br>speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most<br>respectful phrases which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch. She added<br>that Pyotr Petrovitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as<br>he possibly could, he would come immediately to discuss _business_ alone<br>with her and to consider what could be done for her, etc., etc.<br><br>Sonia knew that this would comfort Katerina Ivanovna, would flatter her<br>and gratify her pride. She sat down beside Raskolnikov; she made him a<br>hurried bow, glancing curiously at him. But for the rest of the time<br>she seemed to avoid looking at him or speaking to him. She seemed<br>absent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying<br>to please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get<br>mourning; Sonia was wearing dark brown, and Katerina Ivanovna had on her<br>only dress, a dark striped cotton one.<br><br>The message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. Listening to<br>Sonia with dignity, Katerina Ivanovna inquired with equal dignity how<br>Pyotr Petrovitch was, then at once whispered almost aloud to<br>Raskolnikov that it certainly would have been strange for a man of<br>Pyotr Petrovitch’s position and standing to find himself in such<br>“extraordinary company,” in spite of his devotion to her family and his<br>old friendship with her father.<br><br>“That’s why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, that you have<br>not disdained my hospitality, even in such surroundings,” she added<br>almost aloud. “But I am sure that it was only your special affection for<br>my poor husband that has made you keep your promise.”<br><br>Then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, and<br>suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: “Wouldn’t he<br>have some more meat, and had he been given some wine?” The old man made<br>no answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked,<br>though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him. He<br>simply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased the<br>general mirth.<br><br>“What an imbecile! Look, look! Why was he brought? But as to Pyotr<br>Petrovitch, I always had confidence in him,” Katerina Ivanovna<br>continued, “and, of course, he is not like...” with an extremely stern<br>face she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter<br>was quite disconcerted, “not like your dressed up draggletails whom<br>my father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my late<br>husband would have done them honour if he had invited them in the<br>goodness of his heart.”<br><br>“Yes, he was fond of drink, he was fond of it, he did drink!” cried the<br>commissariat clerk, gulping down his twelfth glass of vodka.<br><br>“My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows<br>it,” Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, “but he was a kind and<br>honourable man, who loved and respected his family. The worst of it was<br>his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he<br>drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you<br>believe it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in his<br>pocket; he was dead drunk, but he did not forget the children!”<br><br>“A cock? Did you say a cock?” shouted the commissariat clerk.<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed, lost in<br>thought.<br><br>“No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too severe with him,” she<br>went on, addressing Raskolnikov. “But that’s not so! He respected me, he<br>respected me very much! He was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was<br>for him sometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used to<br>feel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him and then would<br>think to myself: ‘Be kind to him and he will drink again,’ it was only<br>by severity that you could keep him within bounds.”<br><br>“Yes, he used to get his hair pulled pretty often,” roared the<br>commissariat clerk again, swallowing another glass of vodka.<br><br>“Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as having<br>their hair pulled. I am not talking of my late husband now!” Katerina<br>Ivanovna snapped at him.<br><br>The flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her chest heaved. In<br>another minute she would have been ready to make a scene. Many of the<br>visitors were sniggering, evidently delighted. They began poking the<br>commissariat clerk and whispering something to him. They were evidently<br>trying to egg him on.<br><br>“Allow me to ask what are you alluding to,” began the clerk, “that is<br>to say, whose... about whom... did you say just now... But I don’t care!<br>That’s nonsense! Widow! I forgive you.... Pass!”<br><br>And he took another drink of vodka.<br><br>Raskolnikov sat in silence, listening with disgust. He only ate from<br>politeness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually<br>putting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings. He watched Sonia<br>intently. But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she,<br>too, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with<br>terror Katerina Ivanovna’s growing irritation. She knew that she, Sonia,<br>was the chief reason for the ‘genteel’ ladies’ contemptuous treatment of<br>Katerina Ivanovna’s invitation. She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that<br>the mother was positively offended at the invitation and had asked the<br>question: “How could she let her daughter sit down beside _that young<br>person_?” Sonia had a feeling that Katerina Ivanovna had already heard<br>this and an insult to Sonia meant more to Katerina Ivanovna than an<br>insult to herself, her children, or her father, Sonia knew that<br>Katerina Ivanovna would not be satisfied now, “till she had shown those<br>draggletails that they were both...” To make matters worse someone<br>passed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts<br>pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Katerina Ivanovna flushed<br>crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it<br>was “a drunken ass!”<br><br>Amalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time<br>deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna’s haughtiness, and to restore the<br>good-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began,<br>apropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers “Karl<br>from the chemist’s,” who was driving one night in a cab, and that “the<br>cabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much begged him not to kill,<br>and wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his<br>heart.” Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that<br>Amalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was<br>still more offended, and she retorted that her “_Vater aus Berlin_ was a<br>very important man, and always went with his hands in pockets.” Katerina<br>Ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia<br>Ivanovna lost patience and could scarcely control herself.<br><br>“Listen to the owl!” Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, her<br>good-humour almost restored, “she meant to say he kept his hands in<br>his pockets, but she said he put his hands in people’s pockets.<br>(Cough-cough.) And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these<br>Petersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than<br>we! Can you fancy anyone of us telling how ‘Karl from the chemist’s’<br>‘pierced his heart from fear’ and that the idiot, instead of punishing<br>the cabman, ‘clasped his hands and wept, and much begged.’ Ah, the fool!<br>And you know she fancies it’s very touching and does not suspect how<br>stupid she is! To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great<br>deal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with<br>drink, but you know, these foreigners are always so well behaved<br>and serious.... Look how she sits glaring! She is angry, ha-ha!<br>(Cough-cough-cough.)”<br><br>Regaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling<br>Raskolnikov that when she had obtained her pension, she intended to open<br>a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T----.<br>This was the first time she had spoken to him of the project, and she<br>launched out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that<br>Katerina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of<br>which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told<br>him that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance<br>before the governor and other great personages on leaving school. This<br>certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina<br>Ivanovna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself<br>with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming “those two stuck-up<br>draggletails” if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably<br>that Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, “she might even say<br>aristocratic family, a colonel’s daughter and was far superior to<br>certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late.” The<br>certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken<br>guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually<br>contained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the<br>rank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really<br>was almost the daughter of a colonel.<br><br>Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and<br>happy life they would lead in T----, on the gymnasium teachers whom<br>she would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most<br>respectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna<br>herself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubt<br>teach in her school on moderate terms. Next she spoke of Sonia who would<br>go with her to T---- and help her in all her plans. At this someone at<br>the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.<br><br>Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of<br>it, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of<br>Sonia’s undoubted ability to assist her, of “her gentleness, patience,<br>devotion, generosity and good education,” tapping Sonia on the cheek and<br>kissing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna<br>suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was “nervous<br>and silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and<br>as the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea.”<br><br>At that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in<br>the conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,<br>and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty<br>observation, that “in the future boarding-school she would have to pay<br>particular attention to _die Wäsche_, and that there certainly must be a<br>good _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies<br>must not novels at night read.”<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna, who certainly was upset and very tired, as well as<br>heartily sick of the dinner, at once cut short Amalia Ivanovna, saying<br>“she knew nothing about it and was talking nonsense, that it was the<br>business of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class<br>boarding-school to look after _die Wäsche_, and as for novel-reading,<br>that was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent.” Amalia<br>Ivanovna fired up and getting angry observed that she only “meant her<br>good,” and that “she had meant her very good,” and that “it was long<br>since she had paid her _gold_ for the lodgings.”<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna at once “set her down,” saying that it was a lie to<br>say she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband<br>was lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings. To this<br>Amalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those<br>ladies, but “those ladies had not come, because those ladies _are_<br>ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.” Katerina Ivanovna<br>at once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge<br>what made one really a lady. Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her<br>“_Vater aus Berlin_ was a very, very important man, and both hands in<br>pockets went, and always used to say: ‘Poof! poof!’” and she leapt<br>up from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her<br>pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling “poof!<br>poof!” amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who purposely encouraged<br>Amalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight.<br><br>But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared,<br>so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a<br>father, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once<br>been a cook and probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red<br>as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a<br>father, “but she had a _Vater aus Berlin_ and that he wore a long coat<br>and always said poof-poof-poof!”<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna observed contemptuously that all knew what her family<br>was and that on that very certificate of honour it was stated in print<br>that her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna’s father--if she<br>really had one--was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she<br>never had a father at all, since it was still uncertain whether her name<br>was Amalia Ivanovna or Amalia Ludwigovna.<br><br>At this Amalia Ivanovna, lashed to fury, struck the table with her fist,<br>and shrieked that she was Amalia Ivanovna, and not Ludwigovna, “that<br>her _Vater_ was named Johann and that he was a burgomeister, and that<br>Katerina Ivanovna’s _Vater_ was quite never a burgomeister.” Katerina<br>Ivanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice<br>(though she was pale and her chest was heaving) observed that “if she<br>dared for one moment to set her contemptible wretch of a father on a<br>level with her papa, she, Katerina Ivanovna, would tear her cap off her<br>head and trample it under foot.” Amalia Ivanovna ran about the room,<br>shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and<br>that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she<br>rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.<br>There was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia<br>ran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted<br>something about “the yellow ticket,” Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia<br>away, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat.<br><br>At that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared<br>on the threshold. He stood scanning the party with severe and vigilant<br>eyes. Katerina Ivanovna rushed to him.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>“Pyotr Petrovitch,” she cried, “protect me... you at least! Make this<br>foolish woman understand that she can’t behave like this to a lady in<br>misfortune... that there is a law for such things.... I’ll go to the<br>governor-general himself.... She shall answer for it.... Remembering my<br>father’s hospitality protect these orphans.”<br><br>“Allow me, madam.... Allow me.” Pyotr Petrovitch waved her off. “Your<br>papa as you are well aware I had not the honour of knowing” (someone<br>laughed aloud) “and I do not intend to take part in your everlasting<br>squabbles with Amalia Ivanovna.... I have come here to speak of my own<br>affairs... and I want to have a word with your stepdaughter, Sofya...<br>Ivanovna, I think it is? Allow me to pass.”<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch, edging by her, went to the opposite corner where Sonia<br>was.<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna remained standing where she was, as though<br>thunderstruck. She could not understand how Pyotr Petrovitch could deny<br>having enjoyed her father’s hospitality. Though she had invented it<br>herself, she believed in it firmly by this time. She was struck too<br>by the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr<br>Petrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance. Not<br>only was this “serious business man” strikingly incongruous with the<br>rest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some<br>matter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him<br>and that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, standing<br>beside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not<br>seem to notice him. A minute later Lebeziatnikov, too, appeared in the<br>doorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked<br>interest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed.<br><br>“Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it’s a matter of<br>some importance,” Pyotr Petrovitch observed, addressing the company<br>generally. “I am glad indeed to find other persons present. Amalia<br>Ivanovna, I humbly beg you as mistress of the house to pay careful<br>attention to what I have to say to Sofya Ivanovna. Sofya Ivanovna,”<br> he went on, addressing Sonia, who was very much surprised and already<br>alarmed, “immediately after your visit I found that a hundred-rouble<br>note was missing from my table, in the room of my friend Mr.<br>Lebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where<br>it is now, I assure you on my word of honour and call all present to<br>witness that the matter shall end there. In the opposite case I shall be<br>compelled to have recourse to very serious measures and then... you must<br>blame yourself.”<br><br>Complete silence reigned in the room. Even the crying children were<br>still. Sonia stood deadly pale, staring at Luzhin and unable to say a<br>word. She seemed not to understand. Some seconds passed.<br><br>“Well, how is it to be then?” asked Luzhin, looking intently at her.<br><br>“I don’t know.... I know nothing about it,” Sonia articulated faintly at<br>last.<br><br>“No, you know nothing?” Luzhin repeated and again he paused for some<br>seconds. “Think a moment, mademoiselle,” he began severely, but still,<br>as it were, admonishing her. “Reflect, I am prepared to give you time<br>for consideration. Kindly observe this: if I were not so entirely<br>convinced I should not, you may be sure, with my experience venture to<br>accuse you so directly. Seeing that for such direct accusation before<br>witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense<br>be made responsible, I am aware of that. This morning I changed for<br>my own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of<br>approximately three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my<br>pocket-book. On my return home I proceeded to count the money--as Mr.<br>Lebeziatnikov will bear witness--and after counting two thousand three<br>hundred roubles I put the rest in my pocket-book in my coat pocket.<br>About five hundred roubles remained on the table and among them three<br>notes of a hundred roubles each. At that moment you entered (at my<br>invitation)--and all the time you were present you were exceedingly<br>embarrassed; so that three times you jumped up in the middle of the<br>conversation and tried to make off. Mr. Lebeziatnikov can bear witness<br>to this. You yourself, mademoiselle, probably will not refuse to confirm<br>my statement that I invited you through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, solely in<br>order to discuss with you the hopeless and destitute position of your<br>relative, Katerina Ivanovna (whose dinner I was unable to attend),<br>and the advisability of getting up something of the nature of a<br>subscription, lottery or the like, for her benefit. You thanked me and<br>even shed tears. I describe all this as it took place, primarily to<br>recall it to your mind and secondly to show you that not the slightest<br>detail has escaped my recollection. Then I took a ten-rouble note from<br>the table and handed it to you by way of first instalment on my part<br>for the benefit of your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then<br>I accompanied you to the door--you being still in the same state of<br>embarrassment--after which, being left alone with Mr. Lebeziatnikov I<br>talked to him for ten minutes--then Mr. Lebeziatnikov went out and I<br>returned to the table with the money lying on it, intending to count<br>it and to put it aside, as I proposed doing before. To my surprise one<br>hundred-rouble note had disappeared. Kindly consider the position.<br>Mr. Lebeziatnikov I cannot suspect. I am ashamed to allude to such<br>a supposition. I cannot have made a mistake in my reckoning, for the<br>minute before your entrance I had finished my accounts and found the<br>total correct. You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your<br>eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some<br>time on the table, and taking into consideration your social position<br>and the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and<br>positively against my will, _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--a<br>cruel, but justifiable suspicion! I will add further and repeat that in<br>spite of my positive conviction, I realise that I run a certain risk in<br>making this accusation, but as you see, I could not let it pass. I have<br>taken action and I will tell you why: solely, madam, solely, owing<br>to your black ingratitude! Why! I invite you for the benefit of your<br>destitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and<br>you, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It is too<br>bad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true friend I beg<br>you--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you<br>are doing, otherwise I shall be immovable! Well, what do you say?”<br><br>“I have taken nothing,” Sonia whispered in terror, “you gave me ten<br>roubles, here it is, take it.”<br><br>Sonia pulled her handkerchief out of her pocket, untied a corner of it,<br>took out the ten-rouble note and gave it to Luzhin.<br><br>“And the hundred roubles you do not confess to taking?” he insisted<br>reproachfully, not taking the note.<br><br>Sonia looked about her. All were looking at her with such awful, stern,<br>ironical, hostile eyes. She looked at Raskolnikov... he stood against<br>the wall, with his arms crossed, looking at her with glowing eyes.<br><br>“Good God!” broke from Sonia.<br><br>“Amalia Ivanovna, we shall have to send word to the police and therefore<br>I humbly beg you meanwhile to send for the house porter,” Luzhin said<br>softly and even kindly.<br><br>“_Gott der Barmherzige_! I knew she was the thief,” cried Amalia<br>Ivanovna, throwing up her hands.<br><br>“You knew it?” Luzhin caught her up, “then I suppose you had some reason<br>before this for thinking so. I beg you, worthy Amalia Ivanovna, to<br>remember your words which have been uttered before witnesses.”<br><br>There was a buzz of loud conversation on all sides. All were in<br>movement.<br><br>“What!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and<br>she rushed at Luzhin. “What! You accuse her of stealing? Sonia? Ah, the<br>wretches, the wretches!”<br><br>And running to Sonia she flung her wasted arms round her and held her as<br>in a vise.<br><br>“Sonia! how dared you take ten roubles from him? Foolish girl! Give it<br>to me! Give me the ten roubles at once--here!”<br><br>And snatching the note from Sonia, Katerina Ivanovna crumpled it up and<br>flung it straight into Luzhin’s face. It hit him in the eye and fell<br>on the ground. Amalia Ivanovna hastened to pick it up. Pyotr Petrovitch<br>lost his temper.<br><br>“Hold that mad woman!” he shouted.<br><br>At that moment several other persons, besides Lebeziatnikov, appeared in<br>the doorway, among them the two ladies.<br><br>“What! Mad? Am I mad? Idiot!” shrieked Katerina Ivanovna. “You are an<br>idiot yourself, pettifogging lawyer, base man! Sonia, Sonia take his<br>money! Sonia a thief! Why, she’d give away her last penny!” and Katerina<br>Ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter. “Did you ever see such an<br>idiot?” she turned from side to side. “And you too?” she suddenly saw<br>the landlady, “and you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is a<br>thief, you trashy Prussian hen’s leg in a crinoline! She hasn’t been<br>out of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down<br>beside me, everyone saw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search<br>her! Since she’s not left the room, the money would have to be on her!<br>Search her, search her! But if you don’t find it, then excuse me, my<br>dear fellow, you’ll answer for it! I’ll go to our Sovereign, to our<br>Sovereign, to our gracious Tsar himself, and throw myself at his feet,<br>to-day, this minute! I am alone in the world! They would let me in! Do<br>you think they wouldn’t? You’re wrong, I will get in! I will get in!<br>You reckoned on her meekness! You relied upon that! But I am not so<br>submissive, let me tell you! You’ve gone too far yourself. Search her,<br>search her!”<br><br>And Katerina Ivanovna in a frenzy shook Luzhin and dragged him towards<br>Sonia.<br><br>“I am ready, I’ll be responsible... but calm yourself, madam, calm<br>yourself. I see that you are not so submissive!... Well, well, but as to<br>that...” Luzhin muttered, “that ought to be before the police... though<br>indeed there are witnesses enough as it is.... I am ready.... But in<br>any case it’s difficult for a man... on account of her sex.... But with<br>the help of Amalia Ivanovna... though, of course, it’s not the way to do<br>things.... How is it to be done?”<br><br>“As you will! Let anyone who likes search her!” cried Katerina Ivanovna.<br>“Sonia, turn out your pockets! See! Look, monster, the pocket is empty,<br>here was her handkerchief! Here is the other pocket, look! D’you see,<br>d’you see?”<br><br>And Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside<br>out. But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing<br>a parabola in the air fell at Luzhin’s feet. Everyone saw it, several<br>cried out. Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two<br>fingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a<br>hundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note<br>showing it to everyone.<br><br>“Thief! Out of my lodging. Police, police!” yelled Amalia Ivanovna.<br>“They must to Siberia be sent! Away!”<br><br>Exclamations arose on all sides. Raskolnikov was silent, keeping his<br>eyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.<br>Sonia stood still, as though unconscious. She was hardly able to feel<br>surprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry<br>and hid her face in her hands.<br><br>“No, it wasn’t I! I didn’t take it! I know nothing about it,” she cried<br>with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped<br>her tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the<br>world.<br><br>“Sonia! Sonia! I don’t believe it! You see, I don’t believe it!” she<br>cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her<br>arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her<br>hands and kissing them, too, “you took it! How stupid these people are!<br>Oh dear! You are fools, fools,” she cried, addressing the whole room,<br>“you don’t know, you don’t know what a heart she has, what a girl she<br>is! She take it, she? She’d sell her last rag, she’d go barefoot to help<br>you if you needed it, that’s what she is! She has the yellow passport<br>because my children were starving, she sold herself for us! Ah, husband,<br>husband! Do you see? Do you see? What a memorial dinner for you!<br>Merciful heavens! Defend her, why are you all standing still? Rodion<br>Romanovitch, why don’t you stand up for her? Do you believe it, too? You<br>are not worth her little finger, all of you together! Good God! Defend<br>her now, at least!”<br><br>The wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a<br>great effect on her audience. The agonised, wasted, consumptive face,<br>the parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained<br>as a child’s, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help<br>were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petrovitch<br>at any rate was at once moved to _compassion_.<br><br>“Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!” he cried<br>impressively, “no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an<br>instigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved<br>her guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous<br>idea of it. I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty,<br>so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to<br>confess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step?<br>You lost your head, perhaps? One can quite understand it.... But how<br>could you have lowered yourself to such an action? Gentlemen,” he<br>addressed the whole company, “gentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say,<br>commiserating these people, I am ready to overlook it even now in spite<br>of the personal insult lavished upon me! And may this disgrace be a<br>lesson to you for the future,” he said, addressing Sonia, “and I will<br>carry the matter no further. Enough!”<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met, and the<br>fire in Raskolnikov’s seemed ready to reduce him to ashes. Meanwhile<br>Katerina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing. She was kissing and hugging<br>Sonia like a madwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia on<br>all sides, and Polenka--though she did not fully understand what was<br>wrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty<br>little face, swollen with weeping, on Sonia’s shoulder.<br><br>“How vile!” a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.<br><br>“What vileness!” Lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him straight in the<br>face.<br><br>Pyotr Petrovitch gave a positive start--all noticed it and recalled it<br>afterwards. Lebeziatnikov strode into the room.<br><br>“And you dared to call me as witness?” he said, going up to Pyotr<br>Petrovitch.<br><br>“What do you mean? What are you talking about?” muttered Luzhin.<br><br>“I mean that you... are a slanderer, that’s what my words mean!”<br> Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sighted<br>eyes.<br><br>He was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though<br>seizing and weighing each word. Again there was a silence. Pyotr<br>Petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment.<br><br>“If you mean that for me,...” he began, stammering. “But what’s the<br>matter with you? Are you out of your mind?”<br><br>“I’m in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! I have heard<br>everything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own<br>even now it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for I<br>can’t understand.”<br><br>“Why, what have I done then? Give over talking in your nonsensical<br>riddles! Or maybe you are drunk!”<br><br>“You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! I never touch<br>vodka, for it’s against my convictions. Would you believe it, he, he<br>himself, with his own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble<br>note--I saw it, I was a witness, I’ll take my oath! He did it, he!”<br> repeated Lebeziatnikov, addressing all.<br><br>“Are you crazy, milksop?” squealed Luzhin. “She is herself before<br>you--she herself here declared just now before everyone that I gave her<br>only ten roubles. How could I have given it to her?”<br><br>“I saw it, I saw it,” Lebeziatnikov repeated, “and though it is against<br>my principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like<br>before the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket. Only<br>like a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were saying<br>good-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with<br>the other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, I<br>saw it!”<br><br>Luzhin turned pale.<br><br>“What lies!” he cried impudently, “why, how could you, standing by the<br>window, see the note? You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes. You<br>are raving!”<br><br>“No, I didn’t fancy it. And though I was standing some way off, I saw<br>it all. And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from<br>the window--that’s true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble<br>note, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles,<br>you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I<br>was standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not<br>forget you had it in your hand). You folded it and kept it in your hand<br>all the time. I didn’t think of it again until, when you were getting<br>up, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped<br>it! I noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meant<br>to do her a kindness without my seeing. You can fancy how I watched you<br>and I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket. I saw it, I<br>saw it, I’ll take my oath.”<br><br>Lebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose on all hands<br>chiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone. They all<br>crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.<br><br>“I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one to take her<br>part! She is an orphan. God has sent you!”<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna, hardly knowing what she was doing, sank on her knees<br>before him.<br><br>“A pack of nonsense!” yelled Luzhin, roused to fury, “it’s all nonsense<br>you’ve been talking! ‘An idea struck you, you didn’t think, you<br>noticed’--what does it amount to? So I gave it to her on the sly on<br>purpose? What for? With what object? What have I to do with this...?”<br><br>“What for? That’s what I can’t understand, but that what I am telling<br>you is the fact, that’s certain! So far from my being mistaken, you<br>infamous criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a question<br>occurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressing<br>your hand. What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did it<br>secretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing that<br>my convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private<br>benevolence, which effects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you<br>really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps,<br>too, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she finds a whole<br>hundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I know, some benevolent people<br>are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.) Then<br>the idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether,<br>when she found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that you<br>wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand<br>should not know... something of that sort, in fact. I thought of so<br>many possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought it<br>indelicate to show you that I knew your secret. But another idea struck<br>me again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she<br>noticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her out of<br>the room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket.<br>But on my way I went first to Madame Kobilatnikov’s to take them the<br>‘General Treatise on the Positive Method’ and especially to recommend<br>Piderit’s article (and also Wagner’s); then I come on here and what a<br>state of things I find! Now could I, could I, have all these ideas and<br>reflections if I had not seen you put the hundred-rouble note in her<br>pocket?”<br><br>When Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical<br>deduction at the end, he was quite tired, and the perspiration streamed<br>from his face. He could not, alas, even express himself correctly<br>in Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite<br>exhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speech<br>produced a powerful effect. He had spoken with such vehemence, with such<br>conviction that everyone obviously believed him. Pyotr Petrovitch felt<br>that things were going badly with him.<br><br>“What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?” he shouted,<br>“that’s no evidence. You may have dreamt it, that’s all! And I tell you,<br>you are lying, sir. You are lying and slandering from some spite against<br>me, simply from pique, because I did not agree with your free-thinking,<br>godless, social propositions!”<br><br>But this retort did not benefit Pyotr Petrovitch. Murmurs of disapproval<br>were heard on all sides.<br><br>“Ah, that’s your line now, is it!” cried Lebeziatnikov, “that’s<br>nonsense! Call the police and I’ll take my oath! There’s only one thing<br>I can’t understand: what made him risk such a contemptible action. Oh,<br>pitiful, despicable man!”<br><br>“I can explain why he risked such an action, and if necessary, I, too,<br>will swear to it,” Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice, and he<br>stepped forward.<br><br>He appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt clearly, from the<br>very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would<br>be solved.<br><br>“Now I can explain it all to myself,” said Raskolnikov, addressing<br>Lebeziatnikov. “From the very beginning of the business, I suspected<br>that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it. I began<br>to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which<br>I will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your<br>valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I beg all,<br>all to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) was recently<br>engaged to be married to a young lady--my sister, Avdotya Romanovna<br>Raskolnikov. But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day<br>before yesterday, at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room--I<br>have two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man.... The day<br>before yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room,<br>and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before<br>yesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral,<br>as a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note to<br>my mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not<br>to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most<br>contemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is,<br>hinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you<br>understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister,<br>by insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money<br>which they had sent me and which was all they had. Yesterday evening,<br>before my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I had<br>given the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya<br>Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had<br>never seen her before, indeed. At the same time I added that he,<br>Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth Sofya<br>Semyonovna’s little finger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his<br>question--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I<br>answered that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother<br>and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, he<br>gradually began being unpardonably rude to them. A final rupture took<br>place and he was turned out of the house. All this happened yesterday<br>evening. Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had now<br>succeeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would<br>have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his<br>suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on<br>a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protecting<br>and preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might<br>even, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family,<br>and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing<br>of revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposing<br>that the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to<br>me. That was what he was working for! That’s how I understand it. That’s<br>the whole reason for it and there can be no other!”<br><br>It was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up his<br>speech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by<br>exclamations from his audience. But in spite of interruptions he spoke<br>clearly, calmly, exactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of<br>conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.<br><br>“Yes, yes, that’s it,” Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, “that must be<br>it, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room,<br>whether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s<br>guests. He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret. It was<br>essential for him that you should be here! That’s it, that’s it!”<br><br>Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he was very pale. He<br>seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape. Perhaps he would have<br>been glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this<br>was scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth of<br>the accusations brought against him. Moreover, the company, which had<br>already been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it. The<br>commissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position,<br>was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very<br>unpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came<br>in from all the rooms. The three Poles were tremendously excited<br>and were continually shouting at him: “The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!” and<br>muttering threats in Polish. Sonia had been listening with strained<br>attention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as<br>though she had just returned to consciousness. She did not take her<br>eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina<br>Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.<br>Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth<br>wide open, unable to make out what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr<br>Petrovitch had somehow come to grief.<br><br>Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him.<br>Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.<br>But Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated. Seeing that his accusation of<br>Sonia had completely failed, he had recourse to insolence:<br><br>“Allow me, gentlemen, allow me! Don’t squeeze, let me pass!” he said,<br>making his way through the crowd. “And no threats, if you please! I<br>assure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it. On the<br>contrary, you’ll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing<br>the course of justice. The thief has been more than unmasked, and I<br>shall prosecute. Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and<br>will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and<br>atheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are<br>foolish enough to admit.... Yes, allow me to pass!”<br><br>“Don’t let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave at once, and<br>everything is at an end between us! When I think of the trouble I’ve<br>been taking, the way I’ve been expounding... all this fortnight!”<br><br>“I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried to keep me;<br>now I will simply add that you are a fool. I advise you to see a doctor<br>for your brains and your short sight. Let me pass, gentlemen!”<br><br>He forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to<br>let him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandished<br>it in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew<br>straight at Amalia Ivanovna. She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing,<br>fell heavily under the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room<br>and half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by nature, had<br>felt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than<br>anyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity. Yet till that<br>moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care,<br>gentleness and submissiveness before everyone. Her disappointment was<br>too great. She could, of course, bear with patience and almost without<br>murmur anything, even this. But for the first minute she felt it too<br>bitter. In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first<br>terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all<br>clearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her<br>made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical<br>weeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the room<br>and ran home, almost immediately after Luzhin’s departure. When amidst<br>loud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the<br>landlady could endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina<br>Ivanovna, considering her to blame for everything.<br><br>“Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!”<br><br>And with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay<br>her hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the<br>floor. Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath,<br>jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at<br>Amalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her<br>away like a feather.<br><br>“What! As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature<br>attacks me! What! On the day of my husband’s funeral I am turned out of<br>my lodging! After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street,<br>with my orphans! Where am I to go?” wailed the poor woman, sobbing and<br>gasping. “Good God!” she cried with flashing eyes, “is there no justice<br>upon earth? Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see!<br>There is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit,<br>godless creature! Polenka, stay with the children, I’ll come back. Wait<br>for me, if you have to wait in the street. We will see whether there is<br>justice on earth!”<br><br>And throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had<br>mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the<br>disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and,<br>wailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intention<br>of going at once somewhere to find justice. Polenka with the two little<br>ones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the<br>room, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back. Amalia<br>Ivanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing<br>everything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked<br>incoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had<br>happened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others<br>struck up a song....<br><br>“Now it’s time for me to go,” thought Raskolnikov. “Well, Sofya<br>Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!”<br><br>And he set off in the direction of Sonia’s lodgings.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against<br>Luzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own<br>heart. But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort<br>of relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal<br>feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agitated too,<br>especially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview<br>with Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the<br>terrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the<br>thought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, “Well,<br>Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!” he was still<br>superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over<br>Luzhin. But, strange to say, by the time he reached Sonia’s lodging, he<br>felt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in hesitation at the<br>door, asking himself the strange question: “Must he tell her who killed<br>Lizaveta?” It was a strange question because he felt at the very time<br>not only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could<br>not put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, he<br>only _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before<br>the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation and<br>suffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the<br>doorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in<br>her hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet<br>him as though she were expecting him.<br><br>“What would have become of me but for you?” she said quickly, meeting<br>him in the middle of the room.<br><br>Evidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what she had been<br>waiting for.<br><br>Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she<br>had only just risen. She stood facing him, two steps away, just as she<br>had done the day before.<br><br>“Well, Sonia?” he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, “it was<br>all due to ‘your social position and the habits associated with it.’ Did<br>you understand that just now?”<br><br>Her face showed her distress.<br><br>“Only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,” she interrupted him.<br>“Please don’t begin it. There is misery enough without that.”<br><br>She made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach.<br><br>“I was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? I<br>wanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come.”<br><br>He told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging<br>and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere “to seek justice.”<br><br>“My God!” cried Sonia, “let’s go at once....”<br><br>And she snatched up her cape.<br><br>“It’s everlastingly the same thing!” said Raskolnikov, irritably.<br>“You’ve no thought except for them! Stay a little with me.”<br><br>“But... Katerina Ivanovna?”<br><br>“You won’t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, she’ll come to you<br>herself since she has run out,” he added peevishly. “If she doesn’t find<br>you here, you’ll be blamed for it....”<br><br>Sonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at<br>the floor and deliberating.<br><br>“This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,” he began, not looking<br>at Sonia, “but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would<br>have sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.<br>Ah?”<br><br>“Yes,” she assented in a faint voice. “Yes,” she repeated, preoccupied<br>and distressed.<br><br>“But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite an accident<br>Lebeziatnikov’s turning up.”<br><br>Sonia was silent.<br><br>“And if you’d gone to prison, what then? Do you remember what I said<br>yesterday?”<br><br>Again she did not answer. He waited.<br><br>“I thought you would cry out again ‘don’t speak of it, leave off.’”<br> Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. “What, silence<br>again?” he asked a minute later. “We must talk about something, you<br>know. It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a<br>certain ‘problem’ as Lebeziatnikov would say.” (He was beginning to lose<br>the thread.) “No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you had<br>known all Luzhin’s intentions beforehand. Known, that is, for a fact,<br>that they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and<br>yourself thrown in--since you don’t count yourself for anything--Polenka<br>too... for she’ll go the same way. Well, if suddenly it all depended on<br>your decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whether<br>Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovna<br>should die? How would you decide which of them was to die? I ask you?”<br><br>Sonia looked uneasily at him. There was something peculiar in this<br>hesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundabout<br>way.<br><br>“I felt that you were going to ask some question like that,” she said,<br>looking inquisitively at him.<br><br>“I dare say you did. But how is it to be answered?”<br><br>“Why do you ask about what could not happen?” said Sonia reluctantly.<br><br>“Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked<br>things? You haven’t dared to decide even that!”<br><br>“But I can’t know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask what<br>can’t be answered? What’s the use of such foolish questions? How could<br>it happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judge<br>to decide who is to live and who is not to live?”<br><br>“Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doing<br>anything,” Raskolnikov grumbled morosely.<br><br>“You’d better say straight out what you want!” Sonia cried in distress.<br>“You are leading up to something again.... Can you have come simply to<br>torture me?”<br><br>She could not control herself and began crying bitterly. He looked at<br>her in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed.<br><br>“Of course you’re right, Sonia,” he said softly at last. He was suddenly<br>changed. His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.<br>Even his voice was suddenly weak. “I told you yesterday that I was not<br>coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I’ve said is to ask<br>forgiveness.... I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake.<br>I was asking forgiveness, Sonia....”<br><br>He tried to smile, but there was something helpless and incomplete in<br>his pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his face in his hands.<br><br>And suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred<br>for Sonia passed through his heart. As it were wondering and frightened<br>of this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he<br>met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was<br>love in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real<br>feeling; he had taken the one feeling for the other. It only meant that<br>_that_ minute had come.<br><br>He hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. Suddenly he<br>turned pale, got up from his chair, looked at Sonia, and without<br>uttering a word sat down mechanically on her bed.<br><br>His sensations that moment were terribly like the moment when he had<br>stood over the old woman with the axe in his hand and felt that “he must<br>not lose another minute.”<br><br>“What’s the matter?” asked Sonia, dreadfully frightened.<br><br>He could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all the way he<br>had intended to “tell” and he did not understand what was happening to<br>him now. She went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him and<br>waited, not taking her eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It<br>was unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked,<br>helplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passed<br>through Sonia’s heart.<br><br>“What’s the matter?” she repeated, drawing a little away from him.<br><br>“Nothing, Sonia, don’t be frightened.... It’s nonsense. It really is<br>nonsense, if you think of it,” he muttered, like a man in delirium. “Why<br>have I come to torture you?” he added suddenly, looking at her. “Why,<br>really? I keep asking myself that question, Sonia....”<br><br>He had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour<br>before, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and<br>feeling a continual tremor all over.<br><br>“Oh, how you are suffering!” she muttered in distress, looking intently<br>at him.<br><br>“It’s all nonsense.... Listen, Sonia.” He suddenly smiled, a pale<br>helpless smile for two seconds. “You remember what I meant to tell you<br>yesterday?”<br><br>Sonia waited uneasily.<br><br>“I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, but<br>that if I came to-day I would tell you who... who killed Lizaveta.”<br><br>She began trembling all over.<br><br>“Well, here I’ve come to tell you.”<br><br>“Then you really meant it yesterday?” she whispered with difficulty.<br>“How do you know?” she asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining her<br>reason.<br><br>Sonia’s face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully.<br><br>“I know.”<br><br>She paused a minute.<br><br>“Have they found him?” she asked timidly.<br><br>“No.”<br><br>“Then how do you know about _it_?” she asked again, hardly audibly and<br>again after a minute’s pause.<br><br>He turned to her and looked very intently at her.<br><br>“Guess,” he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.<br><br>A shudder passed over her.<br><br>“But you... why do you frighten me like this?” she said, smiling like a<br>child.<br><br>“I must be a great friend of _his_... since I know,” Raskolnikov went<br>on, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes<br>away. “He... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her<br>accidentally.... He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and<br>he went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he killed her too.”<br><br>Another awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.<br><br>“You can’t guess, then?” he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were<br>flinging himself down from a steeple.<br><br>“N-no...” whispered Sonia.<br><br>“Take a good look.”<br><br>As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his<br>heart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the<br>face of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta’s<br>face, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the<br>wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking<br>as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,<br>looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and<br>holding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the same<br>thing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same<br>terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left<br>hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to<br>get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed<br>even more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear<br>showed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost<br>with the same _childish_ smile.<br><br>“Have you guessed?” he whispered at last.<br><br>“Good God!” broke in an awful wail from her bosom.<br><br>She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a<br>moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands<br>and, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his<br>face again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look she<br>tried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;<br>there was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, when<br>she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she<br>had seen at once that there was no doubt. She could not have said, for<br>instance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as<br>soon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen<br>this very thing.<br><br>“Stop, Sonia, enough! don’t torture me,” he begged her miserably.<br><br>It was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her,<br>but this is how it happened.<br><br>She jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her<br>hands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat<br>down again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden<br>she started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on<br>her knees before him, she did not know why.<br><br>“What have you done--what have you done to yourself?” she said in<br>despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms<br>round him, and held him tightly.<br><br>Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.<br><br>“You are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you<br>about that.... You don’t think what you are doing.”<br><br>“There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!” she<br>cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into<br>violent hysterical weeping.<br><br>A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at<br>once. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyes<br>and hung on his eyelashes.<br><br>“Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?” he said, looking at her almost with<br>hope.<br><br>“No, no, never, nowhere!” cried Sonia. “I will follow you, I will follow<br>you everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how miserable I am!... Why, why didn’t I<br>know you before! Why didn’t you come before? Oh, dear!”<br><br>“Here I have come.”<br><br>“Yes, now! What’s to be done now?... Together, together!” she repeated<br>as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again. “I’ll follow you to<br>Siberia!”<br><br>He recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to<br>his lips.<br><br>“Perhaps I don’t want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia,” he said.<br><br>Sonia looked at him quickly.<br><br>Again after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man<br>the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her. In his changed tone she<br>seemed to hear the murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She<br>knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. Now all<br>these questions rushed at once into her mind. And again she could not<br>believe it: “He, he is a murderer! Could it be true?”<br><br>“What’s the meaning of it? Where am I?” she said in complete<br>bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. “How could you,<br>you, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What does<br>it mean?”<br><br>“Oh, well--to plunder. Leave off, Sonia,” he answered wearily, almost<br>with vexation.<br><br>Sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried:<br><br>“You were hungry! It was... to help your mother? Yes?”<br><br>“No, Sonia, no,” he muttered, turning away and hanging his head. “I was<br>not so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother, but... that’s<br>not the real thing either.... Don’t torture me, Sonia.”<br><br>Sonia clasped her hands.<br><br>“Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! Who could<br>believe it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet<br>rob and murder! Ah,” she cried suddenly, “that money you gave Katerina<br>Ivanovna... that money.... Can that money...”<br><br>“No, Sonia,” he broke in hurriedly, “that money was not it. Don’t worry<br>yourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the<br>day I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....<br>That money was mine--my own.”<br><br>Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.<br><br>“And _that_ money.... I don’t even know really whether there was any<br>money,” he added softly, as though reflecting. “I took a purse off her<br>neck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...<br>but I didn’t look in it; I suppose I hadn’t time.... And the<br>things--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next<br>morning in a yard off the V---- Prospect. They are all there now....”<br><br>Sonia strained every nerve to listen.<br><br>“Then why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?” she<br>asked quickly, catching at a straw.<br><br>“I don’t know.... I haven’t yet decided whether to take that money or<br>not,” he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he<br>gave a brief ironical smile. “Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?”<br><br>The thought flashed through Sonia’s mind, wasn’t he mad? But she<br>dismissed it at once. “No, it was something else.” She could make<br>nothing of it, nothing.<br><br>“Do you know, Sonia,” he said suddenly with conviction, “let me tell<br>you: if I’d simply killed because I was hungry,” laying stress on<br>every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, “I should<br>be _happy_ now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you,” he<br>cried a moment later with a sort of despair, “what would it matter to<br>you if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such<br>a stupid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I’ve come to you<br>to-day?”<br><br>Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.<br><br>“I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left.”<br><br>“Go where?” asked Sonia timidly.<br><br>“Not to steal and not to murder, don’t be anxious,” he smiled bitterly.<br>“We are so different.... And you know, Sonia, it’s only now, only this<br>moment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!<br>Yesterday when I said it I did not know where. I asked you for one<br>thing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You won’t leave me,<br>Sonia?”<br><br>She squeezed his hand.<br><br>“And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?” he cried a minute<br>later in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. “Here you expect<br>an explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see<br>that. But what can I tell you? You won’t understand and will only suffer<br>misery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again.<br>Why do you do it? Because I couldn’t bear my burden and have come to<br>throw it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! And can<br>you love such a mean wretch?”<br><br>“But aren’t you suffering, too?” cried Sonia.<br><br>Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an<br>instant softened it.<br><br>“Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great<br>deal. I have come because I am bad. There are men who wouldn’t have<br>come. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! That’s<br>not the point. I must speak now, but I don’t know how to begin.”<br><br>He paused and sank into thought.<br><br>“Ach, we are so different,” he cried again, “we are not alike. And why,<br>why did I come? I shall never forgive myself that.”<br><br>“No, no, it was a good thing you came,” cried Sonia. “It’s better I<br>should know, far better!”<br><br>He looked at her with anguish.<br><br>“What if it were really that?” he said, as though reaching a conclusion.<br>“Yes, that’s what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I<br>killed her.... Do you understand now?”<br><br>“N-no,” Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. “Only speak, speak, I shall<br>understand, I shall understand _in myself_!” she kept begging him.<br><br>“You’ll understand? Very well, we shall see!” He paused and was for some<br>time lost in meditation.<br><br>“It was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if<br>Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had<br>not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his<br>career with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things,<br>there had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had<br>to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you<br>understand). Well, would he have brought himself to that if there had<br>been no other means? Wouldn’t he have felt a pang at its being so far<br>from monumental and... and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I<br>worried myself fearfully over that ‘question’ so that I was awfully<br>ashamed when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it would<br>not have given him the least pang, that it would not even have struck<br>him that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that there<br>was anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way,<br>he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!<br>Well, I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her, following<br>his example. And that’s exactly how it was! Do you think it funny? Yes,<br>Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that’s just how it<br>was.”<br><br>Sonia did not think it at all funny.<br><br>“You had better tell me straight out... without examples,” she begged,<br>still more timidly and scarcely audibly.<br><br>He turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her hands.<br><br>“You are right again, Sonia. Of course that’s all nonsense, it’s almost<br>all talk! You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely<br>anything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned<br>to drudge as a governess. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a<br>student, but I couldn’t keep myself at the university and was forced<br>for a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten<br>or twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or<br>clerk with a salary of a thousand roubles” (he repeated it as though it<br>were a lesson) “and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief<br>and anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my<br>sister... well, my sister might well have fared worse! And it’s a hard<br>thing to pass everything by all one’s life, to turn one’s back upon<br>everything, to forget one’s mother and decorously accept the insults<br>inflicted on one’s sister. Why should one? When one has buried them to<br>burden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again<br>without a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman’s<br>money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother,<br>to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving<br>it--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up<br>a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....<br>Well... that’s all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did<br>wrong.... Well, that’s enough.”<br><br>He struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head<br>sink.<br><br>“Oh, that’s not it, that’s not it,” Sonia cried in distress. “How could<br>one... no, that’s not right, not right.”<br><br>“You see yourself that it’s not right. But I’ve spoken truly, it’s the<br>truth.”<br><br>“As though that could be the truth! Good God!”<br><br>“I’ve only killed a louse, Sonia, a useless, loathsome, harmful<br>creature.”<br><br>“A human being--a louse!”<br><br>“I too know it wasn’t a louse,” he answered, looking strangely at<br>her. “But I am talking nonsense, Sonia,” he added. “I’ve been talking<br>nonsense a long time.... That’s not it, you are right there. There were<br>quite, quite other causes for it! I haven’t talked to anyone for so<br>long, Sonia.... My head aches dreadfully now.”<br><br>His eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was almost delirious; an<br>uneasy smile strayed on his lips. His terrible exhaustion could be seen<br>through his excitement. Sonia saw how he was suffering. She too<br>was growing dizzy. And he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow<br>comprehensible, but yet... “But how, how! Good God!” And she wrung her<br>hands in despair.<br><br>“No, Sonia, that’s not it,” he began again suddenly, raising his head,<br>as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were<br>roused him--“that’s not it! Better... imagine--yes, it’s certainly<br>better--imagine that I am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive<br>and... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity. (Let’s have it all out<br>at once! They’ve talked of madness already, I noticed.) I told you just<br>now I could not keep myself at the university. But do you know that<br>perhaps I might have done? My mother would have sent me what I needed<br>for the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food,<br>no doubt. Lessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! But I<br>turned sulky and wouldn’t. (Yes, sulkiness, that’s the right word for<br>it!) I sat in my room like a spider. You’ve been in my den, you’ve seen<br>it.... And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp<br>the soul and the mind? Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldn’t<br>go out of it! I wouldn’t on purpose! I didn’t go out for days together,<br>and I wouldn’t work, I wouldn’t even eat, I just lay there doing<br>nothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she didn’t, I<br>went all day without; I wouldn’t ask, on purpose, from sulkiness! At<br>night I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldn’t earn money for<br>candles. I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies<br>an inch thick on the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still and<br>thinking. And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams all the time, strange<br>dreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then I began to fancy<br>that... No, that’s not it! Again I am telling you wrong! You see I kept<br>asking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and I<br>know they are--yet I won’t be wiser? Then I saw, Sonia, that if one<br>waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Afterwards I<br>understood that that would never come to pass, that men won’t change and<br>that nobody can alter it and that it’s not worth wasting effort over it.<br>Yes, that’s so. That’s the law of their nature, Sonia,... that’s so!...<br>And I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will<br>have power over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their<br>eyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he<br>who dares most of all will be most in the right! So it has been till now<br>and so it will always be. A man must be blind not to see it!”<br><br>Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he no longer cared<br>whether she understood or not. The fever had complete hold of him; he<br>was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without<br>talking to anyone). Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his<br>faith and code.<br><br>“I divined then, Sonia,” he went on eagerly, “that power is only<br>vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is only<br>one thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare! Then for the first<br>time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever<br>thought of before me, no one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is<br>that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to<br>go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I... I wanted<br>_to have the daring_... and I killed her. I only wanted to have the<br>daring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!”<br><br>“Oh hush, hush,” cried Sonia, clasping her hands. “You turned away from<br>God and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!”<br><br>“Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became<br>clear to me, was it a temptation of the devil, eh?”<br><br>“Hush, don’t laugh, blasphemer! You don’t understand, you don’t<br>understand! Oh God! He won’t understand!”<br><br>“Hush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it was the devil<br>leading me. Hush, Sonia, hush!” he repeated with gloomy insistence. “I<br>know it all, I have thought it all over and over and whispered it all<br>over to myself, lying there in the dark.... I’ve argued it all over with<br>myself, every point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, how<br>sick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget it<br>and make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking. And you don’t<br>suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a<br>wise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustn’t suppose that<br>I didn’t know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether<br>I had the right to gain power--I certainly hadn’t the right--or that if<br>I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn’t<br>so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his<br>goal without asking questions.... If I worried myself all those days,<br>wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly<br>of course that I wasn’t Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that<br>battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder<br>without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didn’t<br>want to lie about it even to myself. It wasn’t to help my mother I did<br>the murder--that’s nonsense--I didn’t do the murder to gain wealth and<br>power and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it;<br>I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a<br>benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in<br>my web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn’t have cared at that<br>moment.... And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It<br>was not so much the money I wanted, but something else.... I know it all<br>now.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder<br>again. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led<br>me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse<br>like everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or<br>not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling<br>creature or whether I have the _right_...”<br><br>“To kill? Have the right to kill?” Sonia clasped her hands.<br><br>“Ach, Sonia!” he cried irritably and seemed about to make some retort,<br>but was contemptuously silent. “Don’t interrupt me, Sonia. I want to<br>prove one thing only, that the devil led me on then and he has shown me<br>since that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just such<br>a louse as all the rest. He was mocking me and here I’ve come to you<br>now! Welcome your guest! If I were not a louse, should I have come to<br>you? Listen: when I went then to the old woman’s I only went to<br>_try_.... You may be sure of that!”<br><br>“And you murdered her!”<br><br>“But how did I murder her? Is that how men do murders? Do men go to<br>commit a murder as I went then? I will tell you some day how I went!<br>Did I murder the old woman? I murdered myself, not her! I crushed myself<br>once for all, for ever.... But it was the devil that killed that old<br>woman, not I. Enough, enough, Sonia, enough! Let me be!” he cried in a<br>sudden spasm of agony, “let me be!”<br><br>He leaned his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head in his hands as<br>in a vise.<br><br>“What suffering!” A wail of anguish broke from Sonia.<br><br>“Well, what am I to do now?” he asked, suddenly raising his head and<br>looking at her with a face hideously distorted by despair.<br><br>“What are you to do?” she cried, jumping up, and her eyes that had been<br>full of tears suddenly began to shine. “Stand up!” (She seized him by<br>the shoulder, he got up, looking at her almost bewildered.) “Go at once,<br>this very minute, stand at the cross-roads, bow down, first kiss the<br>earth which you have defiled and then bow down to all the world and say<br>to all men aloud, ‘I am a murderer!’ Then God will send you life again.<br>Will you go, will you go?” she asked him, trembling all over, snatching<br>his two hands, squeezing them tight in hers and gazing at him with eyes<br>full of fire.<br><br>He was amazed at her sudden ecstasy.<br><br>“You mean Siberia, Sonia? I must give myself up?” he asked gloomily.<br><br>“Suffer and expiate your sin by it, that’s what you must do.”<br><br>“No! I am not going to them, Sonia!”<br><br>“But how will you go on living? What will you live for?” cried Sonia,<br>“how is it possible now? Why, how can you talk to your mother? (Oh, what<br>will become of them now?) But what am I saying? You have abandoned your<br>mother and your sister already. He has abandoned them already! Oh,<br>God!” she cried, “why, he knows it all himself. How, how can he live by<br>himself! What will become of you now?”<br><br>“Don’t be a child, Sonia,” he said softly. “What wrong have I done<br>them? Why should I go to them? What should I say to them? That’s only a<br>phantom.... They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a<br>virtue. They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them.<br>And what should I say to them--that I murdered her, but did not dare to<br>take the money and hid it under a stone?” he added with a bitter smile.<br>“Why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting<br>it. A coward and a fool! They wouldn’t understand and they don’t deserve<br>to understand. Why should I go to them? I won’t. Don’t be a child,<br>Sonia....”<br><br>“It will be too much for you to bear, too much!” she repeated, holding<br>out her hands in despairing supplication.<br><br>“Perhaps I’ve been unfair to myself,” he observed gloomily, pondering,<br>“perhaps after all I am a man and not a louse and I’ve been in too great<br>a hurry to condemn myself. I’ll make another fight for it.”<br><br>A haughty smile appeared on his lips.<br><br>“What a burden to bear! And your whole life, your whole life!”<br><br>“I shall get used to it,” he said grimly and thoughtfully. “Listen,” he<br>began a minute later, “stop crying, it’s time to talk of the facts: I’ve<br>come to tell you that the police are after me, on my track....”<br><br>“Ach!” Sonia cried in terror.<br><br>“Well, why do you cry out? You want me to go to Siberia and now you are<br>frightened? But let me tell you: I shall not give myself up. I shall<br>make a struggle for it and they won’t do anything to me. They’ve no real<br>evidence. Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but<br>to-day things are going better. All the facts they know can be explained<br>two ways, that’s to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, do<br>you understand? And I shall, for I’ve learnt my lesson. But they will<br>certainly arrest me. If it had not been for something that happened,<br>they would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will<br>arrest me to-day.... But that’s no matter, Sonia; they’ll let me out<br>again... for there isn’t any real proof against me, and there won’t be,<br>I give you my word for it. And they can’t convict a man on what they<br>have against me. Enough.... I only tell you that you may know.... I will<br>try to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they<br>won’t be frightened.... My sister’s future is secure, however, now, I<br>believe... and my mother’s must be too.... Well, that’s all. Be careful,<br>though. Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?”<br><br>“Oh, I will, I will.”<br><br>They sat side by side, both mournful and dejected, as though they had<br>been cast up by the tempest alone on some deserted shore. He looked at<br>Sonia and felt how great was her love for him, and strange to say he<br>felt it suddenly burdensome and painful to be so loved. Yes, it was a<br>strange and awful sensation! On his way to see Sonia he had felt that<br>all his hopes rested on her; he expected to be rid of at least part<br>of his suffering, and now, when all her heart turned towards him, he<br>suddenly felt that he was immeasurably unhappier than before.<br><br>“Sonia,” he said, “you’d better not come and see me when I am in<br>prison.”<br><br>Sonia did not answer, she was crying. Several minutes passed.<br><br>“Have you a cross on you?” she asked, as though suddenly thinking of it.<br><br>He did not at first understand the question.<br><br>“No, of course not. Here, take this one, of cypress wood. I have<br>another, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I changed with<br>Lizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon. I will<br>wear Lizaveta’s now and give you this. Take it... it’s mine! It’s mine,<br>you know,” she begged him. “We will go to suffer together, and together<br>we will bear our cross!”<br><br>“Give it me,” said Raskolnikov.<br><br>He did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he drew back the<br>hand he held out for the cross.<br><br>“Not now, Sonia. Better later,” he added to comfort her.<br><br>“Yes, yes, better,” she repeated with conviction, “when you go to meet<br>your suffering, then put it on. You will come to me, I’ll put it on you,<br>we will pray and go together.”<br><br>At that moment someone knocked three times at the door.<br><br>“Sofya Semyonovna, may I come in?” they heard in a very familiar and<br>polite voice.<br><br>Sonia rushed to the door in a fright. The flaxen head of Mr.<br>Lebeziatnikov appeared at the door.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>Lebeziatnikov looked perturbed.<br><br>“I’ve come to you, Sofya Semyonovna,” he began. “Excuse me... I thought<br>I should find you,” he said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, “that is,<br>I didn’t mean anything... of that sort... But I just thought... Katerina<br>Ivanovna has gone out of her mind,” he blurted out suddenly, turning<br>from Raskolnikov to Sonia.<br><br>Sonia screamed.<br><br>“At least it seems so. But... we don’t know what to do, you see! She<br>came back--she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps<br>beaten.... So it seems at least,... She had run to your father’s former<br>chief, she didn’t find him at home: he was dining at some other<br>general’s.... Only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other general’s,<br>and, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to<br>see her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems. You can imagine what<br>happened. She was turned out, of course; but, according to her own<br>story, she abused him and threw something at him. One may well believe<br>it.... How it is she wasn’t taken up, I can’t understand! Now she is<br>telling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but it’s difficult to<br>understand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about.... Oh yes,<br>she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take the<br>children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children<br>will sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every<br>day under the general’s window... ‘to let everyone see well-born<br>children, whose father was an official, begging in the street.’ She<br>keeps beating the children and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida<br>to sing ‘My Village,’ the boy to dance, Polenka the same. She is tearing<br>up all the clothes, and making them little caps like actors; she means<br>to carry a tin basin and make it tinkle, instead of music.... She won’t<br>listen to anything.... Imagine the state of things! It’s beyond<br>anything!”<br><br>Lebeziatnikov would have gone on, but Sonia, who had heard him almost<br>breathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room,<br>putting on her things as she went. Raskolnikov followed her and<br>Lebeziatnikov came after him.<br><br>“She has certainly gone mad!” he said to Raskolnikov, as they went out<br>into the street. “I didn’t want to frighten Sofya Semyonovna, so I said<br>‘it seemed like it,’ but there isn’t a doubt of it. They say that in<br>consumption the tubercles sometimes occur in the brain; it’s a pity I<br>know nothing of medicine. I did try to persuade her, but she wouldn’t<br>listen.”<br><br>“Did you talk to her about the tubercles?”<br><br>“Not precisely of the tubercles. Besides, she wouldn’t have understood!<br>But what I say is, that if you convince a person logically that he<br>has nothing to cry about, he’ll stop crying. That’s clear. Is it your<br>conviction that he won’t?”<br><br>“Life would be too easy if it were so,” answered Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Excuse me, excuse me; of course it would be rather difficult for<br>Katerina Ivanovna to understand, but do you know that in Paris they have<br>been conducting serious experiments as to the possibility of curing the<br>insane, simply by logical argument? One professor there, a scientific<br>man of standing, lately dead, believed in the possibility of such<br>treatment. His idea was that there’s nothing really wrong with the<br>physical organism of the insane, and that insanity is, so to say, a<br>logical mistake, an error of judgment, an incorrect view of things. He<br>gradually showed the madman his error and, would you believe it, they<br>say he was successful? But as he made use of douches too, how far<br>success was due to that treatment remains uncertain.... So it seems at<br>least.”<br><br>Raskolnikov had long ceased to listen. Reaching the house where he<br>lived, he nodded to Lebeziatnikov and went in at the gate. Lebeziatnikov<br>woke up with a start, looked about him and hurried on.<br><br>Raskolnikov went into his little room and stood still in the middle<br>of it. Why had he come back here? He looked at the yellow and tattered<br>paper, at the dust, at his sofa.... From the yard came a loud continuous<br>knocking; someone seemed to be hammering... He went to the window, rose<br>on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of<br>absorbed attention. But the yard was empty and he could not see who was<br>hammering. In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the<br>window-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung out<br>of the windows... He knew it all by heart. He turned away and sat down<br>on the sofa.<br><br>Never, never had he felt himself so fearfully alone!<br><br>Yes, he felt once more that he would perhaps come to hate Sonia, now<br>that he had made her more miserable.<br><br>“Why had he gone to her to beg for her tears? What need had he to poison<br>her life? Oh, the meanness of it!”<br><br>“I will remain alone,” he said resolutely, “and she shall not come to<br>the prison!”<br><br>Five minutes later he raised his head with a strange smile. That was a<br>strange thought.<br><br>“Perhaps it really would be better in Siberia,” he thought suddenly.<br><br>He could not have said how long he sat there with vague thoughts surging<br>through his mind. All at once the door opened and Dounia came in. At<br>first she stood still and looked at him from the doorway, just as he<br>had done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place<br>as yesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and almost<br>vacantly at her.<br><br>“Don’t be angry, brother; I’ve only come for one minute,” said Dounia.<br><br>Her face looked thoughtful but not stern. Her eyes were bright and soft.<br>He saw that she too had come to him with love.<br><br>“Brother, now I know all, _all_. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and<br>told me everything. They are worrying and persecuting you through a<br>stupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that<br>there is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such<br>horror. I don’t think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must<br>be, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you. That’s<br>what I am afraid of. As for your cutting yourself off from us, I don’t<br>judge you, I don’t venture to judge you, and forgive me for having<br>blamed you for it. I feel that I too, if I had so great a trouble,<br>should keep away from everyone. I shall tell mother nothing _of this_,<br>but I shall talk about you continually and shall tell her from you that<br>you will come very soon. Don’t worry about her; _I_ will set her mind at<br>rest; but don’t you try her too much--come once at least; remember that<br>she is your mother. And now I have come simply to say” (Dounia began<br>to get up) “that if you should need me or should need... all my life or<br>anything... call me, and I’ll come. Good-bye!”<br><br>She turned abruptly and went towards the door.<br><br>“Dounia!” Raskolnikov stopped her and went towards her. “That Razumihin,<br>Dmitri Prokofitch, is a very good fellow.”<br><br>Dounia flushed slightly.<br><br>“Well?” she asked, waiting a moment.<br><br>“He is competent, hardworking, honest and capable of real love....<br>Good-bye, Dounia.”<br><br>Dounia flushed crimson, then suddenly she took alarm.<br><br>“But what does it mean, brother? Are we really parting for ever that<br>you... give me such a parting message?”<br><br>“Never mind.... Good-bye.”<br><br>He turned away, and walked to the window. She stood a moment, looked at<br>him uneasily, and went out troubled.<br><br>No, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very last one)<br>when he had longed to take her in his arms and _say good-bye_ to her,<br>and even _to tell_ her, but he had not dared even to touch her hand.<br><br>“Afterwards she may shudder when she remembers that I embraced her, and<br>will feel that I stole her kiss.”<br><br>“And would _she_ stand that test?” he went on a few minutes later to<br>himself. “No, she wouldn’t; girls like that can’t stand things! They<br>never do.”<br><br>And he thought of Sonia.<br><br>There was a breath of fresh air from the window. The daylight was<br>fading. He took up his cap and went out.<br><br>He could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was. But all<br>this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him. And<br>if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this<br>continual inner strain helped to keep him on his legs and in possession<br>of his faculties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.<br><br>He wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special form of misery had<br>begun to oppress him of late. There was nothing poignant, nothing acute<br>about it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it;<br>it brought a foretaste of hopeless years of this cold leaden misery, a<br>foretaste of an eternity “on a square yard of space.” Towards evening<br>this sensation usually began to weigh on him more heavily.<br><br>“With this idiotic, purely physical weakness, depending on the sunset or<br>something, one can’t help doing something stupid! You’ll go to Dounia,<br>as well as to Sonia,” he muttered bitterly.<br><br>He heard his name called. He looked round. Lebeziatnikov rushed up to<br>him.<br><br>“Only fancy, I’ve been to your room looking for you. Only fancy, she’s<br>carried out her plan, and taken away the children. Sofya Semyonovna and<br>I have had a job to find them. She is rapping on a frying-pan and making<br>the children dance. The children are crying. They keep stopping at the<br>cross-roads and in front of shops; there’s a crowd of fools running<br>after them. Come along!”<br><br>“And Sonia?” Raskolnikov asked anxiously, hurrying after Lebeziatnikov.<br><br>“Simply frantic. That is, it’s not Sofya Semyonovna’s frantic, but<br>Katerina Ivanovna, though Sofya Semyonova’s frantic too. But Katerina<br>Ivanovna is absolutely frantic. I tell you she is quite mad. They’ll be<br>taken to the police. You can fancy what an effect that will have....<br>They are on the canal bank, near the bridge now, not far from Sofya<br>Semyonovna’s, quite close.”<br><br>On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one<br>where Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally<br>of gutter children. The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could<br>be heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle<br>likely to attract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress<br>with the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way<br>on one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted and breathless. Her<br>wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out<br>of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.<br>But her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew<br>more intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed<br>them, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began<br>explaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by<br>their not understanding, beat them.... Then she would make a rush at the<br>crowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she<br>immediately appealed to him to see what these children “from a genteel,<br>one may say aristocratic, house” had been brought to. If she heard<br>laughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffers<br>and begin squabbling with them. Some people laughed, others shook their<br>heads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the<br>frightened children. The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken<br>was not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it. But instead of<br>rapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands,<br>when she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in<br>the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough,<br>which made her curse in despair and even shed tears. What made her most<br>furious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had<br>been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed. The<br>boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk.<br>There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap,<br>or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with<br>a broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina<br>Ivanovna’s grandmother’s and had been preserved as a family possession.<br>Polenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her<br>mother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly realised her<br>mother’s condition, and looked uneasily about her. She was terribly<br>frightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed Katerina<br>Ivanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but Katerina<br>Ivanovna was not to be persuaded.<br><br>“Leave off, Sonia, leave off,” she shouted, speaking fast, panting and<br>coughing. “You don’t know what you ask; you are like a child! I’ve<br>told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. Let<br>everyone, let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets,<br>though their father was an honourable man who served all his life in<br>truth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service.” (Katerina<br>Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly<br>believed it.) “Let that wretch of a general see it! And you are silly,<br>Sonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. We have worried you enough, I<br>won’t go on so! Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?” she cried, seeing<br>Raskolnikov and rushing up to him. “Explain to this silly girl, please,<br>that nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn their<br>living, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are<br>an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary. And that general<br>will lose his post, you’ll see! We shall perform under his windows every<br>day, and if the Tsar drives by, I’ll fall on my knees, put the children<br>before me, show them to him, and say ‘Defend us father.’ He is the<br>father of the fatherless, he is merciful, he’ll protect us, you’ll<br>see, and that wretch of a general.... Lida, _tenez vous droite_! Kolya,<br>you’ll dance again. Why are you whimpering? Whimpering again! What<br>are you afraid of, stupid? Goodness, what am I to do with them, Rodion<br>Romanovitch? If you only knew how stupid they are! What’s one to do with<br>such children?”<br><br>And she, almost crying herself--which did not stop her uninterrupted,<br>rapid flow of talk--pointed to the crying children. Raskolnikov tried<br>to persuade her to go home, and even said, hoping to work on her vanity,<br>that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like<br>an organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of a<br>boarding-school.<br><br>“A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air,” cried Katerina<br>Ivanovna, her laugh ending in a cough. “No, Rodion Romanovitch, that<br>dream is over! All have forsaken us!... And that general.... You know,<br>Rodion Romanovitch, I threw an inkpot at him--it happened to be standing<br>in the waiting-room by the paper where you sign your name. I wrote my<br>name, threw it at him and ran away. Oh, the scoundrels, the scoundrels!<br>But enough of them, now I’ll provide for the children myself, I won’t<br>bow down to anybody! She has had to bear enough for us!” she pointed<br>to Sonia. “Polenka, how much have you got? Show me! What, only two<br>farthings! Oh, the mean wretches! They give us nothing, only run after<br>us, putting their tongues out. There, what is that blockhead laughing<br>at?” (She pointed to a man in the crowd.) “It’s all because Kolya here<br>is so stupid; I have such a bother with him. What do you want, Polenka?<br>Tell me in French, _parlez-moi français_. Why, I’ve taught you, you know<br>some phrases. Else how are you to show that you are of good family, well<br>brought-up children, and not at all like other organ-grinders? We aren’t<br>going to have a Punch and Judy show in the street, but to sing a genteel<br>song.... Ah, yes,... What are we to sing? You keep putting me out,<br>but we... you see, we are standing here, Rodion Romanovitch, to find<br>something to sing and get money, something Kolya can dance to.... For,<br>as you can fancy, our performance is all impromptu.... We must talk it<br>over and rehearse it all thoroughly, and then we shall go to Nevsky,<br>where there are far more people of good society, and we shall be noticed<br>at once. Lida knows ‘My Village’ only, nothing but ‘My Village,’ and<br>everyone sings that. We must sing something far more genteel.... Well,<br>have you thought of anything, Polenka? If only you’d help your mother!<br>My memory’s quite gone, or I should have thought of something. We really<br>can’t sing ‘An Hussar.’ Ah, let us sing in French, ‘Cinq sous,’ I have<br>taught it you, I have taught it you. And as it is in French, people will<br>see at once that you are children of good family, and that will be much<br>more touching.... You might sing ‘Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre,’<br>for that’s quite a child’s song and is sung as a lullaby in all the<br>aristocratic houses.<br><br>“_Marlborough s’en va-t-en guerre Ne sait quand reviendra_...”<br> she began singing. “But no, better sing ‘Cinq sous.’ Now, Kolya, your<br>hands on your hips, make haste, and you, Lida, keep turning the other<br>way, and Polenka and I will sing and clap our hands!<br><br>“_Cinq sous, cinq sous Pour monter notre menage_.”<br><br>(Cough-cough-cough!) “Set your dress straight, Polenka, it’s slipped<br>down on your shoulders,” she observed, panting from coughing. “Now it’s<br>particularly necessary to behave nicely and genteelly, that all may<br>see that you are well-born children. I said at the time that the bodice<br>should be cut longer, and made of two widths. It was your fault, Sonia,<br>with your advice to make it shorter, and now you see the child is quite<br>deformed by it.... Why, you’re all crying again! What’s the matter,<br>stupids? Come, Kolya, begin. Make haste, make haste! Oh, what an<br>unbearable child!<br><br>“Cinq sous, cinq sous.<br><br>“A policeman again! What do you want?”<br><br>A policeman was indeed forcing his way through the crowd. But at that<br>moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat--a solid-looking<br>official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted<br>Katerina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)--approached and<br>without a word handed her a green three-rouble note. His face wore<br>a look of genuine sympathy. Katerina Ivanovna took it and gave him a<br>polite, even ceremonious, bow.<br><br>“I thank you, honoured sir,” she began loftily. “The causes that have<br>induced us (take the money, Polenka: you see there are generous and<br>honourable people who are ready to help a poor gentlewoman in distress).<br>You see, honoured sir, these orphans of good family--I might even say of<br>aristocratic connections--and that wretch of a general sat eating<br>grouse... and stamped at my disturbing him. ‘Your excellency,’ I said,<br>‘protect the orphans, for you knew my late husband, Semyon Zaharovitch,<br>and on the very day of his death the basest of scoundrels slandered his<br>only daughter.’... That policeman again! Protect me,” she cried to the<br>official. “Why is that policeman edging up to me? We have only just run<br>away from one of them. What do you want, fool?”<br><br>“It’s forbidden in the streets. You mustn’t make a disturbance.”<br><br>“It’s you’re making a disturbance. It’s just the same as if I were<br>grinding an organ. What business is it of yours?”<br><br>“You have to get a licence for an organ, and you haven’t got one, and in<br>that way you collect a crowd. Where do you lodge?”<br><br>“What, a license?” wailed Katerina Ivanovna. “I buried my husband<br>to-day. What need of a license?”<br><br>“Calm yourself, madam, calm yourself,” began the official. “Come along;<br>I will escort you.... This is no place for you in the crowd. You are<br>ill.”<br><br>“Honoured sir, honoured sir, you don’t know,” screamed Katerina<br>Ivanovna. “We are going to the Nevsky.... Sonia, Sonia! Where is she?<br>She is crying too! What’s the matter with you all? Kolya, Lida, where<br>are you going?” she cried suddenly in alarm. “Oh, silly children! Kolya,<br>Lida, where are they off to?...”<br><br>Kolya and Lida, scared out of their wits by the crowd, and their<br>mother’s mad pranks, suddenly seized each other by the hand, and ran off<br>at the sight of the policeman who wanted to take them away somewhere.<br>Weeping and wailing, poor Katerina Ivanovna ran after them. She was<br>a piteous and unseemly spectacle, as she ran, weeping and panting for<br>breath. Sonia and Polenka rushed after them.<br><br>“Bring them back, bring them back, Sonia! Oh stupid, ungrateful<br>children!... Polenka! catch them.... It’s for your sakes I...”<br><br>She stumbled as she ran and fell down.<br><br>“She’s cut herself, she’s bleeding! Oh, dear!” cried Sonia, bending over<br>her.<br><br>All ran up and crowded around. Raskolnikov and Lebeziatnikov were the<br>first at her side, the official too hastened up, and behind him the<br>policeman who muttered, “Bother!” with a gesture of impatience, feeling<br>that the job was going to be a troublesome one.<br><br>“Pass on! Pass on!” he said to the crowd that pressed forward.<br><br>“She’s dying,” someone shouted.<br><br>“She’s gone out of her mind,” said another.<br><br>“Lord have mercy upon us,” said a woman, crossing herself. “Have they<br>caught the little girl and the boy? They’re being brought back, the<br>elder one’s got them.... Ah, the naughty imps!”<br><br>When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had<br>not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood<br>that stained the pavement red was from her chest.<br><br>“I’ve seen that before,” muttered the official to Raskolnikov and<br>Lebeziatnikov; “that’s consumption; the blood flows and chokes the<br>patient. I saw the same thing with a relative of my own not long ago...<br>nearly a pint of blood, all in a minute.... What’s to be done though?<br>She is dying.”<br><br>“This way, this way, to my room!” Sonia implored. “I live here!... See,<br>that house, the second from here.... Come to me, make haste,” she turned<br>from one to the other. “Send for the doctor! Oh, dear!”<br><br>Thanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman<br>even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Sonia’s<br>room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was still<br>flowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov,<br>Lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were<br>followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed<br>to the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who<br>were trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from the<br>Kapernaumovs’ room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange<br>appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his<br>wife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several<br>open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these,<br>Svidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at him<br>with surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having<br>noticed him in the crowd. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The<br>official whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now<br>for the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran<br>himself.<br><br>Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. The bleeding ceased<br>for a time. She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at<br>Sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with<br>a handkerchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the<br>bed, supporting her on both sides.<br><br>“Where are the children?” she said in a faint voice. “You’ve brought<br>them, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run away.... Och!”<br><br>Once more her parched lips were covered with blood. She moved her eyes,<br>looking about her.<br><br>“So that’s how you live, Sonia! Never once have I been in your room.”<br><br>She looked at her with a face of suffering.<br><br>“We have been your ruin, Sonia. Polenka, Lida, Kolya, come here! Well,<br>here they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand them over to you, I’ve had<br>enough! The ball is over.” (Cough!) “Lay me down, let me die in peace.”<br><br>They laid her back on the pillow.<br><br>“What, the priest? I don’t want him. You haven’t got a rouble to spare.<br>I have no sins. God must forgive me without that. He knows how I have<br>suffered.... And if He won’t forgive me, I don’t care!”<br><br>She sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times she shuddered,<br>turned her eyes from side to side, recognised everyone for a minute,<br>but at once sank into delirium again. Her breathing was hoarse and<br>difficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat.<br><br>“I said to him, your excellency,” she ejaculated, gasping after each<br>word. “That Amalia Ludwigovna, ah! Lida, Kolya, hands on your hips,<br>make haste! _Glissez, glissez! pas de basque!_ Tap with your heels, be a<br>graceful child!<br><br>“_Du hast Diamanten und Perlen_<br><br>“What next? That’s the thing to sing.<br><br>“_Du hast die schönsten Augen Mädchen, was willst du mehr?_<br><br>“What an idea! _Was willst du mehr?_ What things the fool invents! Ah,<br>yes!<br><br>“In the heat of midday in the vale of Dagestan.<br><br>“Ah, how I loved it! I loved that song to distraction, Polenka! Your<br>father, you know, used to sing it when we were engaged.... Oh those<br>days! Oh that’s the thing for us to sing! How does it go? I’ve<br>forgotten. Remind me! How was it?”<br><br>She was violently excited and tried to sit up. At last, in a horribly<br>hoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word,<br>with a look of growing terror.<br><br>“In the heat of midday!... in the vale!... of Dagestan!... With lead in<br>my breast!...”<br><br>“Your excellency!” she wailed suddenly with a heart-rending scream and<br>a flood of tears, “protect the orphans! You have been their father’s<br>guest... one may say aristocratic....” She started, regaining<br>consciousness, and gazed at all with a sort of terror, but at once<br>recognised Sonia.<br><br>“Sonia, Sonia!” she articulated softly and caressingly, as though<br>surprised to find her there. “Sonia darling, are you here, too?”<br><br>They lifted her up again.<br><br>“Enough! It’s over! Farewell, poor thing! I am done for! I am broken!”<br> she cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on the<br>pillow.<br><br>She sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.<br>Her pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg<br>moved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died.<br><br>Sonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless<br>with her head pressed to the dead woman’s wasted bosom. Polenka threw<br>herself at her mother’s feet, kissing them and weeping violently. Though<br>Kolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling<br>that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other’s<br>little shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened<br>their mouths and began screaming. They were both still in their fancy<br>dress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.<br><br>And how did “the certificate of merit” come to be on the bed beside<br>Katerina Ivanovna? It lay there by the pillow; Raskolnikov saw it.<br><br>He walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.<br><br>“She is dead,” he said.<br><br>“Rodion Romanovitch, I must have two words with you,” said Svidrigaïlov,<br>coming up to them.<br><br>Lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew.<br>Svidrigaïlov drew Raskolnikov further away.<br><br>“I will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that. You know<br>it’s a question of money and, as I told you, I have plenty to spare. I<br>will put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan asylum,<br>and I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming<br>of age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them. And I<br>will pull her out of the mud too, for she is a good girl, isn’t she? So<br>tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand.”<br><br>“What is your motive for such benevolence?” asked Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Ah! you sceptical person!” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “I told you I had no<br>need of that money. Won’t you admit that it’s simply done from humanity?<br>She wasn’t ‘a louse,’ you know” (he pointed to the corner where the<br>dead woman lay), “was she, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you’ll<br>agree, is Luzhin to go on living, and doing wicked things or is she to<br>die? And if I didn’t help them, Polenka would go the same way.”<br><br>He said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping his<br>eyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his own<br>phrases, spoken to Sonia. He quickly stepped back and looked wildly at<br>Svidrigaïlov.<br><br>“How do you know?” he whispered, hardly able to breathe.<br><br>“Why, I lodge here at Madame Resslich’s, the other side of the wall.<br>Here is Kapernaumov, and there lives Madame Resslich, an old and devoted<br>friend of mine. I am a neighbour.”<br><br>“You?”<br><br>“Yes,” continued Svidrigaïlov, shaking with laughter. “I assure you<br>on my honour, dear Rodion Romanovitch, that you have interested me<br>enormously. I told you we should become friends, I foretold it. Well,<br>here we have. And you will see what an accommodating person I am. You’ll<br>see that you can get on with me!”<br><br><br><br><br>PART VI<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER I<br><br>A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had<br>fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there<br>was no escape. Recalling that period long after, he believed that his<br>mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with<br>intervals, till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been<br>mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date<br>of certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his<br>recollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what<br>other people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained<br>events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination. At<br>times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes<br>to panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,<br>of complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous<br>terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes<br>seen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape<br>from a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essential<br>facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome<br>to him. How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the<br>neglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable<br>ruin.<br><br>He was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he might be said to be<br>permanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov. From the time of Svidrigaïlov’s<br>too menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia’s room at the moment of<br>Katerina Ivanovna’s death, the normal working of his mind seemed to<br>break down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness,<br>Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. At times, finding<br>himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched<br>eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had<br>come there, he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov. He recognised<br>suddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an<br>understanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking<br>outside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had<br>fixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another<br>time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes<br>and could not at first understand how he had come there.<br><br>But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna’s death, he<br>had two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia’s lodging, where he<br>had gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no<br>reference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not<br>to speak of it for a time.<br><br>Katerina Ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, Svidrigaïlov was<br>busy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. At<br>their last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made<br>an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s<br>children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting<br>hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at<br>once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled<br>on them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place<br>orphans with some property than destitute ones. He said something<br>too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see<br>Raskolnikov, mentioning that “he would like to consult with him, that<br>there were things they must talk over....”<br><br>This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. Svidrigaïlov<br>looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,<br>dropping his voice, asked: “But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you<br>don’t seem yourself? You look and you listen, but you don’t seem to<br>understand. Cheer up! We’ll talk things over; I am only sorry, I’ve<br>so much to do of my own business and other people’s. Ah, Rodion<br>Romanovitch,” he added suddenly, “what all men need is fresh air, fresh<br>air... more than anything!”<br><br>He moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who<br>were coming up the stairs. They had come for the requiem service. By<br>Svidrigaïlov’s orders it was sung twice a day punctually. Svidrigaïlov<br>went his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed<br>the priest into Sonia’s room. He stood at the door. They began quietly,<br>slowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood the<br>thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive<br>and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem<br>service. And there was something else here as well, too awful and<br>disturbing. He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the<br>coffin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it<br>were, timidly weeping.<br><br>“These last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she hasn’t glanced at<br>me,” Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The sunlight was bright in the room;<br>the incense rose in clouds; the priest read, “Give rest, oh Lord....”<br> Raskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them and<br>took his leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service,<br>Raskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let her<br>head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered<br>Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of<br>repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was the<br>furthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.<br><br>Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He felt<br>very miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he<br>would have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life<br>there. But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had<br>never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on to<br>the high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier<br>the place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near<br>him. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he<br>made haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter<br>restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he felt<br>easier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour<br>listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively<br>enjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,<br>as though his conscience smote him. “Here I sit listening to singing,<br>is that what I ought to be doing?” he thought. Yet he felt at once<br>that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something<br>requiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly<br>understand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. “No, better the<br>struggle again! Better Porfiry again... or Svidrigaïlov.... Better some<br>challenge again... some attack. Yes, yes!” he thought. He went out of<br>the tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and<br>his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he woke<br>up before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling<br>all over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he<br>arrived. After some hours’ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up<br>late, two o’clock in the afternoon.<br><br>He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral had been fixed for that<br>day, and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought him<br>some food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness. His<br>head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three<br>days. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.<br><br>The door opened and Razumihin came in.<br><br>“Ah, he’s eating, then he’s not ill,” said Razumihin. He took a chair<br>and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.<br><br>He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident<br>annoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice. He looked as though<br>he had some special fixed determination.<br><br>“Listen,” he began resolutely. “As far as I am concerned, you may all go<br>to hell, but from what I see, it’s clear to me that I can’t make head or<br>tail of it; please don’t think I’ve come to ask you questions. I don’t<br>want to know, hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say<br>I shouldn’t stay to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come<br>to find out once for all whether it’s a fact that you are mad? There is<br>a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit<br>I’ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid,<br>repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior<br>to your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat them<br>as you have; so you must be mad.”<br><br>“When did you see them last?”<br><br>“Just now. Haven’t you seen them since then? What have you been doing<br>with yourself? Tell me, please. I’ve been to you three times already.<br>Your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday. She had made up<br>her mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she<br>wouldn’t hear a word. ‘If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can<br>look after him like his mother?’ she said. We all came here together, we<br>couldn’t let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm.<br>We came in, you weren’t here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes,<br>while we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: ‘If he’s<br>gone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, it’s<br>humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for<br>kindness.’ She returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever.<br>‘I see,’ she said, ‘that he has time for _his girl_.’ She means by _your<br>girl_ Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mistress, I don’t know. I<br>went at once to Sofya Semyonovna’s, for I wanted to know what was going<br>on. I looked round, I saw the coffin, the children crying, and<br>Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I<br>apologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. So that’s all<br>nonsense and you haven’t got a girl; the most likely thing is that you<br>are mad. But here you sit, guzzling boiled beef as though you’d not had<br>a bite for three days. Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but<br>though you have not said a word to me yet... you are not mad! That I’d<br>swear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all of you,<br>for there’s some mystery, some secret about it, and I don’t intend to<br>worry my brains over your secrets. So I’ve simply come to swear at you,”<br> he finished, getting up, “to relieve my mind. And I know what to do<br>now.”<br><br>“What do you mean to do now?”<br><br>“What business is it of yours what I mean to do?”<br><br>“You are going in for a drinking bout.”<br><br>“How... how did you know?”<br><br>“Why, it’s pretty plain.”<br><br>Razumihin paused for a minute.<br><br>“You always have been a very rational person and you’ve never been mad,<br>never,” he observed suddenly with warmth. “You’re right: I shall drink.<br>Good-bye!”<br><br>And he moved to go out.<br><br>“I was talking with my sister--the day before yesterday, I think it<br>was--about you, Razumihin.”<br><br>“About me! But... where can you have seen her the day before yesterday?”<br> Razumihin stopped short and even turned a little pale.<br><br>One could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and violently.<br><br>“She came here by herself, sat there and talked to me.”<br><br>“She did!”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“What did you say to her... I mean, about me?”<br><br>“I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious man. I didn’t<br>tell her you love her, because she knows that herself.”<br><br>“She knows that herself?”<br><br>“Well, it’s pretty plain. Wherever I might go, whatever happened to me,<br>you would remain to look after them. I, so to speak, give them into your<br>keeping, Razumihin. I say this because I know quite well how you love<br>her, and am convinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she too<br>may love you and perhaps does love you already. Now decide for yourself,<br>as you know best, whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not.”<br><br>“Rodya! You see... well.... Ach, damn it! But where do you mean to go?<br>Of course, if it’s all a secret, never mind.... But I... I shall find<br>out the secret... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense<br>and that you’ve made it all up. Anyway you are a capital fellow, a<br>capital fellow!...”<br><br>“That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, that that was<br>a very good decision of yours not to find out these secrets. Leave it to<br>time, don’t worry about it. You’ll know it all in time when it must be.<br>Yesterday a man said to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh<br>air, fresh air. I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant<br>by that.”<br><br>Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, making a silent<br>conclusion.<br><br>“He’s a political conspirator! He must be. And he’s on the eve of some<br>desperate step, that’s certain. It can only be that! And... and Dounia<br>knows,” he thought suddenly.<br><br>“So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you,” he said, weighing each<br>syllable, “and you’re going to see a man who says we need more air, and<br>so of course that letter... that too must have something to do with it,”<br> he concluded to himself.<br><br>“What letter?”<br><br>“She got a letter to-day. It upset her very much--very much indeed. Too<br>much so. I began speaking of you, she begged me not to. Then... then<br>she said that perhaps we should very soon have to part... then she began<br>warmly thanking me for something; then she went to her room and locked<br>herself in.”<br><br>“She got a letter?” Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.<br><br>“Yes, and you didn’t know? hm...”<br><br>They were both silent.<br><br>“Good-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I.... Never mind,<br>good-bye. You see, there was a time.... Well, good-bye! I must be off<br>too. I am not going to drink. There’s no need now.... That’s all stuff!”<br><br>He hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him, he<br>suddenly opened it again, and said, looking away:<br><br>“Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know Porfiry’s, that<br>old woman? Do you know the murderer has been found, he has confessed<br>and given the proofs. It’s one of those very workmen, the painter, only<br>fancy! Do you remember I defended them here? Would you believe it, all<br>that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on the stairs<br>while the porter and the two witnesses were going up, he got up on<br>purpose to disarm suspicion. The cunning, the presence of mind of the<br>young dog! One can hardly credit it; but it’s his own explanation, he<br>has confessed it all. And what a fool I was about it! Well, he’s simply<br>a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of<br>the lawyers--so there’s nothing much to wonder at, I suppose! Of course<br>people like that are always possible. And the fact that he couldn’t keep<br>up the character, but confessed, makes him easier to believe in. But<br>what a fool I was! I was frantic on their side!”<br><br>“Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why does it interest<br>you so?” Raskolnikov asked with unmistakable agitation.<br><br>“What next? You ask me why it interests me!... Well, I heard it from<br>Porfiry, among others... It was from him I heard almost all about it.”<br><br>“From Porfiry?”<br><br>“From Porfiry.”<br><br>“What... what did he say?” Raskolnikov asked in dismay.<br><br>“He gave me a capital explanation of it. Psychologically, after his<br>fashion.”<br><br>“He explained it? Explained it himself?”<br><br>“Yes, yes; good-bye. I’ll tell you all about it another time, but now<br>I’m busy. There was a time when I fancied... But no matter, another<br>time!... What need is there for me to drink now? You have made me drunk<br>without wine. I am drunk, Rodya! Good-bye, I’m going. I’ll come again<br>very soon.”<br><br>He went out.<br><br>“He’s a political conspirator, there’s not a doubt about it,” Razumihin<br>decided, as he slowly descended the stairs. “And he’s drawn his sister<br>in; that’s quite, quite in keeping with Avdotya Romanovna’s character.<br>There are interviews between them!... She hinted at it too... So many of<br>her words.... and hints... bear that meaning! And how else can all this<br>tangle be explained? Hm! And I was almost thinking... Good heavens,<br>what I thought! Yes, I took leave of my senses and I wronged him! It was<br>his doing, under the lamp in the corridor that day. Pfoo! What a crude,<br>nasty, vile idea on my part! Nikolay is a brick, for confessing.... And<br>how clear it all is now! His illness then, all his strange actions...<br>before this, in the university, how morose he used to be, how gloomy....<br>But what’s the meaning now of that letter? There’s something in that,<br>too, perhaps. Whom was it from? I suspect...! No, I must find out!”<br><br>He thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his heart throbbed,<br>and he suddenly broke into a run.<br><br>As soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, turned to the window,<br>walked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the<br>smallness of his room, and sat down again on the sofa. He felt, so to<br>speak, renewed; again the struggle, so a means of escape had come.<br><br>“Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been too stifling, too<br>cramping, the burden had been too agonising. A lethargy had come upon<br>him at times. From the moment of the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry’s he<br>had been suffocating, penned in without hope of escape. After Nikolay’s<br>confession, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his<br>behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike anything he<br>could have imagined beforehand; he had grown feebler, instantly and<br>fundamentally! And he had agreed at the time with Sonia, he had agreed<br>in his heart he could not go on living alone with such a thing on his<br>mind!<br><br>“And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle... He worried him, that was true, but<br>somehow not on the same point. He might still have a struggle to come<br>with Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, too, might be a means of escape; but<br>Porfiry was a different matter.<br><br>“And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, had explained it<br>_psychologically_. He had begun bringing in his damned psychology again!<br>Porfiry? But to think that Porfiry should for one moment believe that<br>Nikolay was guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay’s<br>appearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could have only<br>_one_ explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov had often recalled<br>passages in that scene with Porfiry; he could not bear to let his mind<br>rest on it.) Such words, such gestures had passed between them, they<br>had exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and had<br>reached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen through at the<br>first word, at the first gesture, could not have shaken his conviction.<br><br>“And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! The scene in the<br>corridor under the lamp had produced its effect then. He had rushed to<br>Porfiry.... But what had induced the latter to receive him like that?<br>What had been his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He must<br>have some plan; there was some design, but what was it? It was true that<br>a long time had passed since that morning--too long a time--and no sight<br>nor sound of Porfiry. Well, that was a bad sign....”<br><br>Raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still pondering. It<br>was the first time for a long while that he had felt clear in his mind,<br>at least. “I must settle Svidrigaïlov,” he thought, “and as soon as<br>possible; he, too, seems to be waiting for me to come to him of my own<br>accord.” And at that moment there was such a rush of hate in his<br>weary heart that he might have killed either of those two--Porfiry or<br>Svidrigaïlov. At least he felt that he would be capable of doing it<br>later, if not now.<br><br>“We shall see, we shall see,” he repeated to himself.<br><br>But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled upon Porfiry<br>himself in the passage. He was coming in to see him. Raskolnikov was<br>dumbfounded for a minute, but only for one minute. Strange to say, he<br>was not very much astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of<br>him. He was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard.<br>“Perhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have approached<br>so quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard nothing? Could he have been<br>listening at the door?”<br><br>“You didn’t expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch,” Porfiry explained,<br>laughing. “I’ve been meaning to look in a long time; I was passing by<br>and thought why not go in for five minutes. Are you going out? I won’t<br>keep you long. Just let me have one cigarette.”<br><br>“Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down.” Raskolnikov gave his visitor<br>a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have<br>marvelled at himself, if he could have seen it.<br><br>The last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained! So a man<br>will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand,<br>yet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear.<br><br>Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at him<br>without flinching. Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a<br>cigarette.<br><br>“Speak, speak,” seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov’s<br>heart. “Come, why don’t you speak?”<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER II<br><br>“Ah these cigarettes!” Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, having<br>lighted one. “They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I<br>can’t give them up! I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat and<br>a difficulty in breathing. You know I am a coward, I went lately to<br>Dr. B----n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient. He<br>positively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: ‘Tobacco’s bad for<br>you,’ he said, ‘your lungs are affected.’ But how am I to give it up?<br>What is there to take its place? I don’t drink, that’s the mischief,<br>he-he-he, that I don’t. Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch,<br>everything is relative!”<br><br>“Why, he’s playing his professional tricks again,” Raskolnikov thought<br>with disgust. All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly<br>came back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon<br>him then.<br><br>“I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn’t<br>know?” Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking round the room. “I came into<br>this very room. I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought<br>I’d return your call. I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked<br>round, waited and went out without leaving my name with your servant.<br>Don’t you lock your door?”<br><br>Raskolnikov’s face grew more and more gloomy. Porfiry seemed to guess<br>his state of mind.<br><br>“I’ve come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow!<br>I owe you an explanation and must give it to you,” he continued with a<br>slight smile, just patting Raskolnikov’s knee.<br><br>But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his<br>face; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it. He had<br>never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face.<br><br>“A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch.<br>Our first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thing<br>after another! This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you;<br>I feel it. Do you remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and<br>your knees were shaking and so were mine. And, you know, our behaviour<br>was unseemly, even ungentlemanly. And yet we are gentlemen, above all,<br>in any case, gentlemen; that must be understood. Do you remember what we<br>came to?... and it was quite indecorous.”<br><br>“What is he up to, what does he take me for?” Raskolnikov asked himself<br>in amazement, raising his head and looking with open eyes on Porfiry.<br><br>“I’ve decided openness is better between us,” Porfiry Petrovitch went<br>on, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling to<br>disconcert his former victim and as though disdaining his former wiles.<br>“Yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Nikolay<br>put a stop to it, or I don’t know what we might not have come to. That<br>damned workman was sitting at the time in the next room--can you realise<br>that? You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to you<br>afterwards. But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for<br>anyone, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I hadn’t? What<br>shall I say to you? it had all come upon me so suddenly. I had scarcely<br>sent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, I dare say).<br>An idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see,<br>Rodion Romanovitch. Come, I thought--even if I let one thing slip for<br>a time, I shall get hold of something else--I shan’t lose what I want,<br>anyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;<br>it’s out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character,<br>which I flatter myself I have to some extent divined. Of course I did<br>reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and<br>blurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you make a<br>man lose all patience, though even then it’s rare. I was capable of<br>realising that. If I only had a fact, I thought, the least little fact<br>to go upon, something I could lay hold of, something tangible, not<br>merely psychological. For if a man is guilty, you must be able to get<br>something substantial out of him; one may reckon upon most surprising<br>results indeed. I was reckoning on your temperament, Rodion Romanovitch,<br>on your temperament above all things! I had great hopes of you at that<br>time.”<br><br>“But what are you driving at now?” Raskolnikov muttered at last, asking<br>the question without thinking.<br><br>“What is he talking about?” he wondered distractedly, “does he really<br>take me to be innocent?”<br><br>“What am I driving at? I’ve come to explain myself, I consider it my<br>duty, so to speak. I want to make clear to you how the whole business,<br>the whole misunderstanding arose. I’ve caused you a great deal of<br>suffering, Rodion Romanovitch. I am not a monster. I understand what<br>it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud,<br>imperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment!<br>I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without<br>elements of magnanimity, though I don’t agree with all your convictions.<br>I wanted to tell you this first, frankly and quite sincerely, for above<br>all I don’t want to deceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I felt<br>attracted by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a<br>right to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you’ve no<br>reason to like me. You may think what you like, but I desire now to do<br>all I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart<br>and conscience. I speak sincerely.”<br><br>Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause. Raskolnikov felt a rush of<br>renewed alarm. The thought that Porfiry believed him to be innocent<br>began to make him uneasy.<br><br>“It’s scarcely necessary to go over everything in detail,” Porfiry<br>Petrovitch went on. “Indeed, I could scarcely attempt it. To begin with<br>there were rumours. Through whom, how, and when those rumours came to<br>me... and how they affected you, I need not go into. My suspicions<br>were aroused by a complete accident, which might just as easily not have<br>happened. What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to go into that<br>either. Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind. I<br>admit it openly--for one may as well make a clean breast of it--I was<br>the first to pitch on you. The old woman’s notes on the pledges and<br>the rest of it--that all came to nothing. Yours was one of a hundred.<br>I happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who<br>described it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great<br>vividness. It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, my<br>dear fellow! How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas? From a<br>hundred rabbits you can’t make a horse, a hundred suspicions don’t make<br>a proof, as the English proverb says, but that’s only from the rational<br>point of view--you can’t help being partial, for after all a lawyer<br>is only human. I thought, too, of your article in that journal, do you<br>remember, on your first visit we talked of it? I jeered at you at the<br>time, but that was only to lead you on. I repeat, Rodion Romanovitch,<br>you are ill and impatient. That you were bold, headstrong, in earnest<br>and... had felt a great deal I recognised long before. I, too, have felt<br>the same, so that your article seemed familiar to me. It was conceived<br>on sleepless nights, with a throbbing heart, in ecstasy and suppressed<br>enthusiasm. And that proud suppressed enthusiasm in young people is<br>dangerous! I jeered at you then, but let me tell you that, as a literary<br>amateur, I am awfully fond of such first essays, full of the heat of<br>youth. There is a mistiness and a chord vibrating in the mist. Your<br>article is absurd and fantastic, but there’s a transparent sincerity,<br>a youthful incorruptible pride and the daring of despair in it. It’s a<br>gloomy article, but that’s what’s fine in it. I read your article and<br>put it aside, thinking as I did so ‘that man won’t go the common way.’<br>Well, I ask you, after that as a preliminary, how could I help being<br>carried away by what followed? Oh, dear, I am not saying anything, I<br>am not making any statement now. I simply noted it at the time. What is<br>there in it? I reflected. There’s nothing in it, that is really nothing<br>and perhaps absolutely nothing. And it’s not at all the thing for<br>the prosecutor to let himself be carried away by notions: here I have<br>Nikolay on my hands with actual evidence against him--you may think what<br>you like of it, but it’s evidence. He brings in his psychology, too; one<br>has to consider him, too, for it’s a matter of life and death. Why am<br>I explaining this to you? That you may understand, and not blame my<br>malicious behaviour on that occasion. It was not malicious, I assure<br>you, he-he! Do you suppose I didn’t come to search your room at the<br>time? I did, I did, he-he! I was here when you were lying ill in bed,<br>not officially, not in my own person, but I was here. Your room was<br>searched to the last thread at the first suspicion; but _umsonst_! I<br>thought to myself, now that man will come, will come of himself and<br>quickly, too; if he’s guilty, he’s sure to come. Another man wouldn’t,<br>but he will. And you remember how Mr. Razumihin began discussing the<br>subject with you? We arranged that to excite you, so we purposely spread<br>rumours, that he might discuss the case with you, and Razumihin is not a<br>man to restrain his indignation. Mr. Zametov was tremendously struck by<br>your anger and your open daring. Think of blurting out in a restaurant<br>‘I killed her.’ It was too daring, too reckless. I thought so myself, if<br>he is guilty he will be a formidable opponent. That was what I thought<br>at the time. I was expecting you. But you simply bowled Zametov over<br>and... well, you see, it all lies in this--that this damnable psychology<br>can be taken two ways! Well, I kept expecting you, and so it was, you<br>came! My heart was fairly throbbing. Ach!<br><br>“Now, why need you have come? Your laughter, too, as you came in, do you<br>remember? I saw it all plain as daylight, but if I hadn’t expected you<br>so specially, I should not have noticed anything in your laughter. You<br>see what influence a mood has! Mr. Razumihin then--ah, that stone, that<br>stone under which the things were hidden! I seem to see it somewhere<br>in a kitchen garden. It was in a kitchen garden, you told Zametov and<br>afterwards you repeated that in my office? And when we began picking<br>your article to pieces, how you explained it! One could take every word<br>of yours in two senses, as though there were another meaning hidden.<br><br>“So in this way, Rodion Romanovitch, I reached the furthest limit, and<br>knocking my head against a post, I pulled myself up, asking myself what<br>I was about. After all, I said, you can take it all in another sense if<br>you like, and it’s more natural so, indeed. I couldn’t help admitting<br>it was more natural. I was bothered! ‘No, I’d better get hold of some<br>little fact’ I said. So when I heard of the bell-ringing, I held my<br>breath and was all in a tremor. ‘Here is my little fact,’ thought I, and<br>I didn’t think it over, I simply wouldn’t. I would have given a thousand<br>roubles at that minute to have seen you with my own eyes, when you<br>walked a hundred paces beside that workman, after he had called you<br>murderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question<br>all the way. And then what about your trembling, what about your<br>bell-ringing in your illness, in semi-delirium?<br><br>“And so, Rodion Romanovitch, can you wonder that I played such pranks on<br>you? And what made you come at that very minute? Someone seemed to<br>have sent you, by Jove! And if Nikolay had not parted us... and do you<br>remember Nikolay at the time? Do you remember him clearly? It was a<br>thunderbolt, a regular thunderbolt! And how I met him! I didn’t believe<br>in the thunderbolt, not for a minute. You could see it for yourself;<br>and how could I? Even afterwards, when you had gone and he began making<br>very, very plausible answers on certain points, so that I was surprised<br>at him myself, even then I didn’t believe his story! You see what it is<br>to be as firm as a rock! No, thought I, _Morgenfrüh_. What has Nikolay<br>got to do with it!”<br><br>“Razumihin told me just now that you think Nikolay guilty and had<br>yourself assured him of it....”<br><br>His voice failed him, and he broke off. He had been listening in<br>indescribable agitation, as this man who had seen through and through<br>him, went back upon himself. He was afraid of believing it and did not<br>believe it. In those still ambiguous words he kept eagerly looking for<br>something more definite and conclusive.<br><br>“Mr. Razumihin!” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question<br>from Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent. “He-he-he! But I had to<br>put Mr. Razumihin off; two is company, three is none. Mr. Razumihin is<br>not the right man, besides he is an outsider. He came running to me<br>with a pale face.... But never mind him, why bring him in? To return<br>to Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how I<br>understand him, that is? To begin with, he is still a child and not<br>exactly a coward, but something by way of an artist. Really, don’t laugh<br>at my describing him so. He is innocent and responsive to influence. He<br>has a heart, and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, he tells<br>stories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him.<br>He attends school too, and laughs till he cries if you hold up a finger<br>to him; he will drink himself senseless--not as a regular vice, but at<br>times, when people treat him, like a child. And he stole, too, then,<br>without knowing it himself, for ‘How can it be stealing, if one picks it<br>up?’ And do you know he is an Old Believer, or rather a dissenter? There<br>have been Wanderers[*] in his family, and he was for two years in his<br>village under the spiritual guidance of a certain elder. I learnt all<br>this from Nikolay and from his fellow villagers. And what’s more, he<br>wanted to run into the wilderness! He was full of fervour, prayed at<br>night, read the old books, ‘the true’ ones, and read himself crazy.<br><br>     [*] A religious sect.--TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.<br><br>“Petersburg had a great effect upon him, especially the women and the<br>wine. He responds to everything and he forgot the elder and all that. I<br>learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see<br>him, and now this business came upon him.<br><br>“Well, he was frightened, he tried to hang himself! He ran away! How can<br>one get over the idea the people have of Russian legal proceedings? The<br>very word ‘trial’ frightens some of them. Whose fault is it? We shall<br>see what the new juries will do. God grant they do good! Well, in<br>prison, it seems, he remembered the venerable elder; the Bible, too,<br>made its appearance again. Do you know, Rodion Romanovitch, the force of<br>the word ‘suffering’ among some of these people! It’s not a question of<br>suffering for someone’s benefit, but simply, ‘one must suffer.’ If they<br>suffer at the hands of the authorities, so much the better. In my time<br>there was a very meek and mild prisoner who spent a whole year in prison<br>always reading his Bible on the stove at night and he read himself<br>crazy, and so crazy, do you know, that one day, apropos of nothing, he<br>seized a brick and flung it at the governor; though he had done him<br>no harm. And the way he threw it too: aimed it a yard on one side<br>on purpose, for fear of hurting him. Well, we know what happens to<br>a prisoner who assaults an officer with a weapon. So ‘he took his<br>suffering.’<br><br>“So I suspect now that Nikolay wants to take his suffering or something<br>of the sort. I know it for certain from facts, indeed. Only he doesn’t<br>know that I know. What, you don’t admit that there are such fantastic<br>people among the peasants? Lots of them. The elder now has begun<br>influencing him, especially since he tried to hang himself. But he’ll<br>come and tell me all himself. You think he’ll hold out? Wait a bit,<br>he’ll take his words back. I am waiting from hour to hour for him to<br>come and abjure his evidence. I have come to like that Nikolay and am<br>studying him in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He answered me<br>very plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence<br>and prepared himself cleverly. But on other points he is simply at sea,<br>knows nothing and doesn’t even suspect that he doesn’t know!<br><br>“No, Rodion Romanovitch, Nikolay doesn’t come in! This is a fantastic,<br>gloomy business, a modern case, an incident of to-day when the heart<br>of man is troubled, when the phrase is quoted that blood ‘renews,’ when<br>comfort is preached as the aim of life. Here we have bookish dreams, a<br>heart unhinged by theories. Here we see resolution in the first stage,<br>but resolution of a special kind: he resolved to do it like jumping over<br>a precipice or from a bell tower and his legs shook as he went to the<br>crime. He forgot to shut the door after him, and murdered two people for<br>a theory. He committed the murder and couldn’t take the money, and what<br>he did manage to snatch up he hid under a stone. It wasn’t enough for<br>him to suffer agony behind the door while they battered at the door and<br>rung the bell, no, he had to go to the empty lodging, half delirious, to<br>recall the bell-ringing, he wanted to feel the cold shiver over again....<br>Well, that we grant, was through illness, but consider this: he is<br>a murderer, but looks upon himself as an honest man, despises others,<br>poses as injured innocence. No, that’s not the work of a Nikolay, my<br>dear Rodion Romanovitch!”<br><br>All that had been said before had sounded so like a recantation that<br>these words were too great a shock. Raskolnikov shuddered as though he<br>had been stabbed.<br><br>“Then... who then... is the murderer?” he asked in a breathless voice,<br>unable to restrain himself.<br><br>Porfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he were amazed at<br>the question.<br><br>“Who is the murderer?” he repeated, as though unable to believe his<br>ears. “Why, _you_, Rodion Romanovitch! You are the murderer,” he added,<br>almost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction.<br><br>Raskolnikov leapt from the sofa, stood up for a few seconds and sat down<br>again without uttering a word. His face twitched convulsively.<br><br>“Your lip is twitching just as it did before,” Porfiry Petrovitch<br>observed almost sympathetically. “You’ve been misunderstanding me, I<br>think, Rodion Romanovitch,” he added after a brief pause, “that’s why<br>you are so surprised. I came on purpose to tell you everything and deal<br>openly with you.”<br><br>“It was not I murdered her,” Raskolnikov whispered like a frightened<br>child caught in the act.<br><br>“No, it was you, you Rodion Romanovitch, and no one else,” Porfiry<br>whispered sternly, with conviction.<br><br>They were both silent and the silence lasted strangely long, about ten<br>minutes. Raskolnikov put his elbow on the table and passed his fingers<br>through his hair. Porfiry Petrovitch sat quietly waiting. Suddenly<br>Raskolnikov looked scornfully at Porfiry.<br><br>“You are at your old tricks again, Porfiry Petrovitch! Your old method<br>again. I wonder you don’t get sick of it!”<br><br>“Oh, stop that, what does that matter now? It would be a different<br>matter if there were witnesses present, but we are whispering alone. You<br>see yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare.<br>Whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I am<br>convinced without it.”<br><br>“If so, what did you come for?” Raskolnikov asked irritably. “I ask you<br>the same question again: if you consider me guilty, why don’t you take<br>me to prison?”<br><br>“Oh, that’s your question! I will answer you, point for point. In the<br>first place, to arrest you so directly is not to my interest.”<br><br>“How so? If you are convinced you ought....”<br><br>“Ach, what if I am convinced? That’s only my dream for the time. Why<br>should I put you in safety? You know that’s it, since you ask me to do<br>it. If I confront you with that workman for instance and you say to him<br>‘were you drunk or not? Who saw me with you? I simply took you to be<br>drunk, and you were drunk, too.’ Well, what could I answer, especially<br>as your story is a more likely one than his? for there’s nothing but<br>psychology to support his evidence--that’s almost unseemly with his ugly<br>mug, while you hit the mark exactly, for the rascal is an inveterate<br>drunkard and notoriously so. And I have myself admitted candidly several<br>times already that that psychology can be taken in two ways and that the<br>second way is stronger and looks far more probable, and that apart from<br>that I have as yet nothing against you. And though I shall put you in<br>prison and indeed have come--quite contrary to etiquette--to inform you<br>of it beforehand, yet I tell you frankly, also contrary to etiquette,<br>that it won’t be to my advantage. Well, secondly, I’ve come to you<br>because...”<br><br>“Yes, yes, secondly?” Raskolnikov was listening breathless.<br><br>“Because, as I told you just now, I consider I owe you an explanation. I<br>don’t want you to look upon me as a monster, as I have a genuine liking<br>for you, you may believe me or not. And in the third place I’ve come to<br>you with a direct and open proposition--that you should surrender<br>and confess. It will be infinitely more to your advantage and to my<br>advantage too, for my task will be done. Well, is this open on my part<br>or not?”<br><br>Raskolnikov thought a minute.<br><br>“Listen, Porfiry Petrovitch. You said just now you have nothing but<br>psychology to go on, yet now you’ve gone on mathematics. Well, what if<br>you are mistaken yourself, now?”<br><br>“No, Rodion Romanovitch, I am not mistaken. I have a little fact even<br>then, Providence sent it me.”<br><br>“What little fact?”<br><br>“I won’t tell you what, Rodion Romanovitch. And in any case, I haven’t<br>the right to put it off any longer, I must arrest you. So think it over:<br>it makes no difference to me _now_ and so I speak only for your sake.<br>Believe me, it will be better, Rodion Romanovitch.”<br><br>Raskolnikov smiled malignantly.<br><br>“That’s not simply ridiculous, it’s positively shameless. Why, even if I<br>were guilty, which I don’t admit, what reason should I have to confess,<br>when you tell me yourself that I shall be in greater safety in prison?”<br><br>“Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don’t put too much faith in words, perhaps<br>prison will not be altogether a restful place. That’s only theory and<br>my theory, and what authority am I for you? Perhaps, too, even now I am<br>hiding something from you? I can’t lay bare everything, he-he! And how<br>can you ask what advantage? Don’t you know how it would lessen your<br>sentence? You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken<br>the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case. Consider that! I<br>swear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall<br>come as a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all these<br>psychological points, of a suspicion against you, so that your crime<br>will appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth it<br>was an aberration. I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep<br>my word.”<br><br>Raskolnikov maintained a mournful silence and let his head sink<br>dejectedly. He pondered a long while and at last smiled again, but his<br>smile was sad and gentle.<br><br>“No!” he said, apparently abandoning all attempt to keep up appearances<br>with Porfiry, “it’s not worth it, I don’t care about lessening the<br>sentence!”<br><br>“That’s just what I was afraid of!” Porfiry cried warmly and, as it<br>seemed, involuntarily. “That’s just what I feared, that you wouldn’t<br>care about the mitigation of sentence.”<br><br>Raskolnikov looked sadly and expressively at him.<br><br>“Ah, don’t disdain life!” Porfiry went on. “You have a great deal of<br>it still before you. How can you say you don’t want a mitigation of<br>sentence? You are an impatient fellow!”<br><br>“A great deal of what lies before me?”<br><br>“Of life. What sort of prophet are you, do you know much about it? Seek<br>and ye shall find. This may be God’s means for bringing you to Him. And<br>it’s not for ever, the bondage....”<br><br>“The time will be shortened,” laughed Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Why, is it the bourgeois disgrace you are afraid of? It may be that you<br>are afraid of it without knowing it, because you are young! But anyway<br>_you_ shouldn’t be afraid of giving yourself up and confessing.”<br><br>“Ach, hang it!” Raskolnikov whispered with loathing and contempt, as<br>though he did not want to speak aloud.<br><br>He got up again as though he meant to go away, but sat down again in<br>evident despair.<br><br>“Hang it, if you like! You’ve lost faith and you think that I am<br>grossly flattering you; but how long has your life been? How much do<br>you understand? You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke<br>down and turned out to be not at all original! It turned out something<br>base, that’s true, but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base!<br>At least you didn’t deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the<br>furthest point at one bound. How do I regard you? I regard you as one<br>of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts<br>their entrails out, if only they have found faith or God. Find it and<br>you will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too,<br>is a good thing. Suffer! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer.<br>I know you don’t believe in it--but don’t be over-wise; fling yourself<br>straight into life, without deliberation; don’t be afraid--the flood<br>will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again. What<br>bank? How can I tell? I only believe that you have long life before<br>you. I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared<br>beforehand, but maybe you will remember them after. They may be of use<br>some time. That’s why I speak. It’s as well that you only killed the<br>old woman. If you’d invented another theory you might perhaps have<br>done something a thousand times more hideous. You ought to thank God,<br>perhaps. How do you know? Perhaps God is saving you for something.<br>But keep a good heart and have less fear! Are you afraid of the great<br>expiation before you? No, it would be shameful to be afraid of it. Since<br>you have taken such a step, you must harden your heart. There is justice<br>in it. You must fulfil the demands of justice. I know that you don’t<br>believe it, but indeed, life will bring you through. You will live it<br>down in time. What you need now is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air!”<br><br>Raskolnikov positively started.<br><br>“But who are you? what prophet are you? From the height of what majestic<br>calm do you proclaim these words of wisdom?”<br><br>“Who am I? I am a man with nothing to hope for, that’s all. A man<br>perhaps of feeling and sympathy, maybe of some knowledge too, but my day<br>is over. But you are a different matter, there is life waiting for you.<br>Though, who knows? maybe your life, too, will pass off in smoke and come<br>to nothing. Come, what does it matter, that you will pass into another<br>class of men? It’s not comfort you regret, with your heart! What of<br>it that perhaps no one will see you for so long? It’s not time, but<br>yourself that will decide that. Be the sun and all will see you. The<br>sun has before all to be the sun. Why are you smiling again? At my being<br>such a Schiller? I bet you’re imagining that I am trying to get round<br>you by flattery. Well, perhaps I am, he-he-he! Perhaps you’d better not<br>believe my word, perhaps you’d better never believe it altogether--I’m<br>made that way, I confess it. But let me add, you can judge for yourself,<br>I think, how far I am a base sort of man and how far I am honest.”<br><br>“When do you mean to arrest me?”<br><br>“Well, I can let you walk about another day or two. Think it over, my<br>dear fellow, and pray to God. It’s more in your interest, believe me.”<br><br>“And what if I run away?” asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile.<br><br>“No, you won’t run away. A peasant would run away, a fashionable<br>dissenter would run away, the flunkey of another man’s thought, for<br>you’ve only to show him the end of your little finger and he’ll be ready<br>to believe in anything for the rest of his life. But you’ve ceased to<br>believe in your theory already, what will you run away with? And what<br>would you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, and<br>what you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an<br>atmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmosphere would you have? If<br>you ran away, you’d come back to yourself. _You can’t get on without<br>us._ And if I put you in prison--say you’ve been there a month, or two,<br>or three--remember my word, you’ll confess of yourself and perhaps to<br>your own surprise. You won’t know an hour beforehand that you are coming<br>with a confession. I am convinced that you will decide, ‘to take your<br>suffering.’ You don’t believe my words now, but you’ll come to it of<br>yourself. For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing. Never<br>mind my having grown fat, I know all the same. Don’t laugh at it,<br>there’s an idea in suffering, Nikolay is right. No, you won’t run away,<br>Rodion Romanovitch.”<br><br>Raskolnikov got up and took his cap. Porfiry Petrovitch also rose.<br><br>“Are you going for a walk? The evening will be fine, if only we don’t<br>have a storm. Though it would be a good thing to freshen the air.”<br><br>He, too, took his cap.<br><br>“Porfiry Petrovitch, please don’t take up the notion that I have<br>confessed to you to-day,” Raskolnikov pronounced with sullen insistence.<br>“You’re a strange man and I have listened to you from simple curiosity.<br>But I have admitted nothing, remember that!”<br><br>“Oh, I know that, I’ll remember. Look at him, he’s trembling! Don’t<br>be uneasy, my dear fellow, have it your own way. Walk about a bit, you<br>won’t be able to walk too far. If anything happens, I have one request<br>to make of you,” he added, dropping his voice. “It’s an awkward one, but<br>important. If anything were to happen (though indeed I don’t believe<br>in it and think you quite incapable of it), yet in case you were taken<br>during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to<br>the business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion--laying hands<br>on yourself--(it’s an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me for<br>it) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the<br>stone. It will be more generous. Come, till we meet! Good thoughts and<br>sound decisions to you!”<br><br>Porfiry went out, stooping and avoiding looking at Raskolnikov. The<br>latter went to the window and waited with irritable impatience till he<br>calculated that Porfiry had reached the street and moved away. Then he<br>too went hurriedly out of the room.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER III<br><br>He hurried to Svidrigaïlov’s. What he had to hope from that man he<br>did not know. But that man had some hidden power over him. Having once<br>recognised this, he could not rest, and now the time had come.<br><br>On the way, one question particularly worried him: had Svidrigaïlov been<br>to Porfiry’s?<br><br>As far as he could judge, he would swear to it, that he had not. He<br>pondered again and again, went over Porfiry’s visit; no, he hadn’t been,<br>of course he hadn’t.<br><br>But if he had not been yet, would he go? Meanwhile, for the present he<br>fancied he couldn’t. Why? He could not have explained, but if he could,<br>he would not have wasted much thought over it at the moment. It all<br>worried him and at the same time he could not attend to it. Strange to<br>say, none would have believed it perhaps, but he only felt a faint vague<br>anxiety about his immediate future. Another, much more important anxiety<br>tormented him--it concerned himself, but in a different, more vital way.<br>Moreover, he was conscious of immense moral fatigue, though his mind was<br>working better that morning than it had done of late.<br><br>And was it worth while, after all that had happened, to contend with<br>these new trivial difficulties? Was it worth while, for instance, to<br>manoeuvre that Svidrigaïlov should not go to Porfiry’s? Was it worth<br>while to investigate, to ascertain the facts, to waste time over anyone<br>like Svidrigaïlov?<br><br>Oh, how sick he was of it all!<br><br>And yet he was hastening to Svidrigaïlov; could he be expecting<br>something _new_ from him, information, or means of escape? Men will<br>catch at straws! Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together?<br>Perhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not Svidrigaïlov<br>but some other whom he needed, and Svidrigaïlov had simply presented<br>himself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia for now? To beg<br>her tears again? He was afraid of Sonia, too. Sonia stood before him as<br>an irrevocable sentence. He must go his own way or hers. At that moment<br>especially he did not feel equal to seeing her. No, would it not be<br>better to try Svidrigaïlov? And he could not help inwardly owning that<br>he had long felt that he must see him for some reason.<br><br>But what could they have in common? Their very evil-doing could not<br>be of the same kind. The man, moreover, was very unpleasant, evidently<br>depraved, undoubtedly cunning and deceitful, possibly malignant. Such<br>stories were told about him. It is true he was befriending Katerina<br>Ivanovna’s children, but who could tell with what motive and what it<br>meant? The man always had some design, some project.<br><br>There was another thought which had been continually hovering of late<br>about Raskolnikov’s mind, and causing him great uneasiness. It was so<br>painful that he made distinct efforts to get rid of it. He sometimes<br>thought that Svidrigaïlov was dogging his footsteps. Svidrigaïlov had<br>found out his secret and had had designs on Dounia. What if he had them<br>still? Wasn’t it practically certain that he had? And what if, having<br>learnt his secret and so having gained power over him, he were to use it<br>as a weapon against Dounia?<br><br>This idea sometimes even tormented his dreams, but it had never<br>presented itself so vividly to him as on his way to Svidrigaïlov.<br>The very thought moved him to gloomy rage. To begin with, this would<br>transform everything, even his own position; he would have at once to<br>confess his secret to Dounia. Would he have to give himself up perhaps<br>to prevent Dounia from taking some rash step? The letter? This morning<br>Dounia had received a letter. From whom could she get letters in<br>Petersburg? Luzhin, perhaps? It’s true Razumihin was there to protect<br>her, but Razumihin knew nothing of the position. Perhaps it was his duty<br>to tell Razumihin? He thought of it with repugnance.<br><br>In any case he must see Svidrigaïlov as soon as possible, he decided<br>finally. Thank God, the details of the interview were of little<br>consequence, if only he could get at the root of the matter; but<br>if Svidrigaïlov were capable... if he were intriguing against<br>Dounia--then...<br><br>Raskolnikov was so exhausted by what he had passed through that month<br>that he could only decide such questions in one way; “then I shall kill<br>him,” he thought in cold despair.<br><br>A sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in the middle of<br>the street and began looking about to see where he was and which way he<br>was going. He found himself in X. Prospect, thirty or forty paces from<br>the Hay Market, through which he had come. The whole second storey of<br>the house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide<br>open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were<br>full to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and<br>violin, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking.<br>He was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. Prospect,<br>when suddenly at one of the end windows he saw Svidrigaïlov, sitting<br>at a tea-table right in the open window with a pipe in his mouth.<br>Raskolnikov was dreadfully taken aback, almost terrified. Svidrigaïlov<br>was silently watching and scrutinising him and, what struck Raskolnikov<br>at once, seemed to be meaning to get up and slip away unobserved.<br>Raskolnikov at once pretended not to have seen him, but to be looking<br>absent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.<br>His heart was beating violently. Yet, it was evident that Svidrigaïlov<br>did not want to be seen. He took the pipe out of his mouth and was on<br>the point of concealing himself, but as he got up and moved back his<br>chair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen<br>him, and was watching him. What had passed between them was much the<br>same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room. A<br>sly smile came into Svidrigaïlov’s face and grew broader and<br>broader. Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At last<br>Svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh.<br><br>“Well, well, come in if you want me; I am here!” he shouted from the<br>window.<br><br>Raskolnikov went up into the tavern. He found Svidrigaïlov in a tiny<br>back room, adjoining the saloon in which merchants, clerks and numbers<br>of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the<br>desperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls<br>could be heard in the distance. On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood<br>an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he found<br>also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl<br>of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with<br>ribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some<br>servants’ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of<br>the organ.<br><br>“Come, that’s enough,” Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov’s<br>entrance. The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.<br>She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful<br>expression in her face.<br><br>“Hey, Philip, a glass!” shouted Svidrigaïlov.<br><br>“I won’t drink anything,” said Raskolnikov.<br><br>“As you like, I didn’t mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don’t want<br>anything more to-day, you can go.” He poured her out a full glass, and<br>laid down a yellow note.<br><br>Katia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down,<br>in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov’s hand, which he<br>allowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed<br>after her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.<br>Svidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him<br>was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip,<br>was by now an old friend and very obsequious.<br><br>The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidrigaïlov was at<br>home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern was<br>dirty and wretched, not even second-rate.<br><br>“I was going to see you and looking for you,” Raskolnikov began, “but<br>I don’t know what made me turn from the Hay Market into the X. Prospect<br>just now. I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay<br>Market. And this isn’t the way to you. I simply turned and here you are.<br>It is strange!”<br><br>“Why don’t you say at once ‘it’s a miracle’?”<br><br>“Because it may be only chance.”<br><br>“Oh, that’s the way with all you folk,” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “You won’t<br>admit it, even if you do inwardly believe it a miracle! Here you say<br>that it may be only chance. And what cowards they all are here, about<br>having an opinion of their own, you can’t fancy, Rodion Romanovitch. I<br>don’t mean you, you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to<br>have it. That’s how it was you attracted my curiosity.”<br><br>“Nothing else?”<br><br>“Well, that’s enough, you know,” Svidrigaïlov was obviously exhilarated,<br>but only slightly so, he had not had more than half a glass of wine.<br><br>“I fancy you came to see me before you knew that I was capable of having<br>what you call an opinion of my own,” observed Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Oh, well, it was a different matter. Everyone has his own plans. And<br>apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep<br>for the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself, there<br>is no miracle in your coming straight here. I explained the way myself,<br>told you where it was, and the hours you could find me here. Do you<br>remember?”<br><br>“I don’t remember,” answered Raskolnikov with surprise.<br><br>“I believe you. I told you twice. The address has been stamped<br>mechanically on your memory. You turned this way mechanically and yet<br>precisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of<br>it. When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me. You give<br>yourself away too much, Rodion Romanovitch. And another thing, I’m<br>convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves<br>as they walk. This is a town of crazy people. If only we had scientific<br>men, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable<br>investigations in Petersburg each in his own line. There are few places<br>where there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul<br>of man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of climate mean so much.<br>And it’s the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must<br>be reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor there<br>now. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk out<br>of your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it<br>sink, and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently see<br>nothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips and<br>talking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at<br>last stand still in the middle of the road. That’s not at all the thing.<br>Someone may be watching you besides me, and it won’t do you any good.<br>It’s nothing really to do with me and I can’t cure you, but, of course,<br>you understand me.”<br><br>“Do you know that I am being followed?” asked Raskolnikov, looking<br>inquisitively at him.<br><br>“No, I know nothing about it,” said Svidrigaïlov, seeming surprised.<br><br>“Well, then, let us leave me alone,” Raskolnikov muttered, frowning.<br><br>“Very good, let us leave you alone.”<br><br>“You had better tell me, if you come here to drink, and directed me<br>twice to come here to you, why did you hide, and try to get away just<br>now when I looked at the window from the street? I saw it.”<br><br>“He-he! And why was it you lay on your sofa with closed eyes and<br>pretended to be asleep, though you were wide awake while I stood in your<br>doorway? I saw it.”<br><br>“I may have had... reasons. You know that yourself.”<br><br>“And I may have had my reasons, though you don’t know them.”<br><br>Raskolnikov dropped his right elbow on the table, leaned his chin in the<br>fingers of his right hand, and stared intently at Svidrigaïlov. For a<br>full minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before. It<br>was a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips,<br>with a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow<br>too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. There was<br>something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so<br>wonderfully young for his age. Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light<br>summer clothes and was particularly dainty in his linen. He wore a huge<br>ring with a precious stone in it.<br><br>“Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?” said Raskolnikov<br>suddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point. “Even<br>though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me,<br>I don’t want to put myself out any more. I will show you at once that I<br>don’t prize myself as you probably think I do. I’ve come to tell you at<br>once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister<br>and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has<br>been discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up.<br>You can reckon on my word. You know that I can keep it. And in the<br>second place if you want to tell me anything--for I keep fancying all<br>this time that you have something to tell me--make haste and tell it,<br>for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late.”<br><br>“Why in such haste?” asked Svidrigaïlov, looking at him curiously.<br><br>“Everyone has his plans,” Raskolnikov answered gloomily and impatiently.<br><br>“You urged me yourself to frankness just now, and at the first question<br>you refuse to answer,” Svidrigaïlov observed with a smile. “You<br>keep fancying that I have aims of my own and so you look at me with<br>suspicion. Of course it’s perfectly natural in your position. But<br>though I should like to be friends with you, I shan’t trouble myself<br>to convince you of the contrary. The game isn’t worth the candle and I<br>wasn’t intending to talk to you about anything special.”<br><br>“What did you want me, for, then? It was you who came hanging about me.”<br><br>“Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I liked the<br>fantastic nature of your position--that’s what it was! Besides you are<br>the brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person<br>I had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I<br>gathered that you had a great influence over her; isn’t that enough?<br>Ha-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and<br>is difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have come to me<br>not only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something<br>new. Isn’t that so? Isn’t that so?” persisted Svidrigaïlov with a sly<br>smile. “Well, can’t you fancy then that I, too, on my way here in the<br>train was reckoning on you, on your telling me something new, and on my<br>making some profit out of you! You see what rich men we are!”<br><br>“What profit could you make?”<br><br>“How can I tell you? How do I know? You see in what a tavern I spend all<br>my time and it’s my enjoyment, that’s to say it’s no great enjoyment,<br>but one must sit somewhere; that poor Katia now--you saw her?... If only<br>I had been a glutton now, a club gourmand, but you see I can eat this.”<br><br>He pointed to a little table in the corner where the remnants of a<br>terrible-looking beef-steak and potatoes lay on a tin dish.<br><br>“Have you dined, by the way? I’ve had something and want nothing more.<br>I don’t drink, for instance, at all. Except for champagne I never touch<br>anything, and not more than a glass of that all the evening, and even<br>that is enough to make my head ache. I ordered it just now to wind<br>myself up, for I am just going off somewhere and you see me in a<br>peculiar state of mind. That was why I hid myself just now like a<br>schoolboy, for I was afraid you would hinder me. But I believe,” he<br>pulled out his watch, “I can spend an hour with you. It’s half-past<br>four now. If only I’d been something, a landowner, a father, a cavalry<br>officer, a photographer, a journalist... I am nothing, no specialty,<br>and sometimes I am positively bored. I really thought you would tell me<br>something new.”<br><br>“But what are you, and why have you come here?”<br><br>“What am I? You know, a gentleman, I served for two years in the<br>cavalry, then I knocked about here in Petersburg, then I married Marfa<br>Petrovna and lived in the country. There you have my biography!”<br><br>“You are a gambler, I believe?”<br><br>“No, a poor sort of gambler. A card-sharper--not a gambler.”<br><br>“You have been a card-sharper then?”<br><br>“Yes, I’ve been a card-sharper too.”<br><br>“Didn’t you get thrashed sometimes?”<br><br>“It did happen. Why?”<br><br>“Why, you might have challenged them... altogether it must have been<br>lively.”<br><br>“I won’t contradict you, and besides I am no hand at philosophy. I<br>confess that I hastened here for the sake of the women.”<br><br>“As soon as you buried Marfa Petrovna?”<br><br>“Quite so,” Svidrigaïlov smiled with engaging candour. “What of it? You<br>seem to find something wrong in my speaking like that about women?”<br><br>“You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?”<br><br>“Vice! Oh, that’s what you are after! But I’ll answer you in order,<br>first about women in general; you know I am fond of talking. Tell me,<br>what should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women, since I<br>have a passion for them? It’s an occupation, anyway.”<br><br>“So you hope for nothing here but vice?”<br><br>“Oh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice. But anyway<br>I like a direct question. In this vice at least there is something<br>permanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy,<br>something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever<br>setting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even<br>with years. You’ll agree it’s an occupation of a sort.”<br><br>“That’s nothing to rejoice at, it’s a disease and a dangerous one.”<br><br>“Oh, that’s what you think, is it! I agree, that it is a disease like<br>everything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, in this one must<br>exceed moderation. But in the first place, everybody does so in one way<br>or another, and in the second place, of course, one ought to be moderate<br>and prudent, however mean it may be, but what am I to do? If I hadn’t<br>this, I might have to shoot myself. I am ready to admit that a decent<br>man ought to put up with being bored, but yet...”<br><br>“And could you shoot yourself?”<br><br>“Oh, come!” Svidrigaïlov parried with disgust. “Please don’t speak of<br>it,” he added hurriedly and with none of the bragging tone he had shown<br>in all the previous conversation. His face quite changed. “I admit it’s<br>an unpardonable weakness, but I can’t help it. I am afraid of death and<br>I dislike its being talked of. Do you know that I am to a certain extent<br>a mystic?”<br><br>“Ah, the apparitions of Marfa Petrovna! Do they still go on visiting<br>you?”<br><br>“Oh, don’t talk of them; there have been no more in Petersburg, confound<br>them!” he cried with an air of irritation. “Let’s rather talk of that...<br>though... H’m! I have not much time, and can’t stay long with you,<br>it’s a pity! I should have found plenty to tell you.”<br><br>“What’s your engagement, a woman?”<br><br>“Yes, a woman, a casual incident.... No, that’s not what I want to talk<br>of.”<br><br>“And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn’t<br>that affect you? Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?”<br><br>“And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You surprised me just<br>now, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so.<br>You preach to me about vice and æsthetics! You--a Schiller, you--an<br>idealist! Of course that’s all as it should be and it would be<br>surprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality.... Ah,<br>what a pity I have no time, for you’re a most interesting type! And,<br>by-the-way, are you fond of Schiller? I am awfully fond of him.”<br><br>“But what a braggart you are,” Raskolnikov said with some disgust.<br><br>“Upon my word, I am not,” answered Svidrigaïlov laughing. “However, I<br>won’t dispute it, let me be a braggart, why not brag, if it hurts no<br>one? I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when<br>I come across an intelligent person like you--intelligent and highly<br>interesting--I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I’ve drunk that<br>half-glass of champagne and it’s gone to my head a little. And besides,<br>there’s a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that<br>I... will keep quiet. Where are you off to?” he asked in alarm.<br><br>Raskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and,<br>as it were, ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced that<br>Svidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.<br><br>“A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!” Svidrigaïlov begged. “Let them bring<br>you some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won’t talk nonsense, about<br>myself, I mean. I’ll tell you something. If you like I’ll tell you how a<br>woman tried ‘to save’ me, as you would call it? It will be an answer to<br>your first question indeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell<br>you? It will help to spend the time.”<br><br>“Tell me, but I trust that you...”<br><br>“Oh, don’t be uneasy. Besides, even in a worthless low fellow like me,<br>Avdotya Romanovna can only excite the deepest respect.”<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER IV<br><br>“You know perhaps--yes, I told you myself,” began Svidrigaïlov, “that<br>I was in the debtors’ prison here, for an immense sum, and had not<br>any expectation of being able to pay it. There’s no need to go into<br>particulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a<br>point of insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest woman,<br>and very sensible, although completely uneducated. Would you believe<br>that this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and<br>reproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which<br>she kept throughout our married life? She was considerably older than<br>I, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth. There<br>was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to<br>tell her straight out that I couldn’t be absolutely faithful to her.<br>This confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have<br>liked my brutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling to<br>deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous<br>woman, you know, that’s the first consideration. After many tears an<br>unwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that I would never<br>leave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that I<br>would never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would<br>never set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, Marfa<br>Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her<br>secret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman of<br>our class; sixthly, in case I--which God forbid--should be visited by<br>a great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. On<br>this last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease. She was a<br>sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute<br>profligate incapable of real love. But a sensible woman and a jealous<br>woman are two very different things, and that’s where the trouble<br>came in. But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain<br>preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people<br>about us. I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than<br>in anyone’s. Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was<br>ridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very<br>ridiculous ways, but I tell you frankly that I feel really sorry for the<br>innumerable woes of which I was the cause. Well, and that’s enough, I<br>think, by way of a decorous _oraison funèbre_ for the most tender wife<br>of a most tender husband. When we quarrelled, I usually held my tongue<br>and did not irritate her and that gentlemanly conduct rarely failed to<br>attain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed. These were<br>times when she was positively proud of me. But your sister she couldn’t<br>put up with, anyway. And however she came to risk taking such a<br>beautiful creature into her house as a governess. My explanation is that<br>Marfa Petrovna was an ardent and impressionable woman and simply fell<br>in love herself--literally fell in love--with your sister. Well, little<br>wonder--look at Avdotya Romanovna! I saw the danger at the first glance<br>and what do you think, I resolved not to look at her even. But Avdotya<br>Romanovna herself made the first step, would you believe it? Would you<br>believe it too that Marfa Petrovna was positively angry with me at first<br>for my persistent silence about your sister, for my careless reception<br>of her continual adoring praises of Avdotya Romanovna. I don’t know<br>what it was she wanted! Well, of course, Marfa Petrovna told Avdotya<br>Romanovna every detail about me. She had the unfortunate habit of<br>telling literally everyone all our family secrets and continually<br>complaining of me; how could she fail to confide in such a delightful<br>new friend? I expect they talked of nothing else but me and no doubt<br>Avdotya Romanovna heard all those dark mysterious rumours that were<br>current about me.... I don’t mind betting that you too have heard<br>something of the sort already?”<br><br>“I have. Luzhin charged you with having caused the death of a child. Is<br>that true?”<br><br>“Don’t refer to those vulgar tales, I beg,” said Svidrigaïlov with<br>disgust and annoyance. “If you insist on wanting to know about all that<br>idiocy, I will tell you one day, but now...”<br><br>“I was told too about some footman of yours in the country whom you<br>treated badly.”<br><br>“I beg you to drop the subject,” Svidrigaïlov interrupted again with<br>obvious impatience.<br><br>“Was that the footman who came to you after death to fill your pipe?...<br>you told me about it yourself.” Raskolnikov felt more and more<br>irritated.<br><br>Svidrigaïlov looked at him attentively and Raskolnikov fancied he caught<br>a flash of spiteful mockery in that look. But Svidrigaïlov restrained<br>himself and answered very civilly:<br><br>“Yes, it was. I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall<br>feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Upon<br>my soul! I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with<br>some people. Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having<br>repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip<br>about me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any<br>case it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Romanovna’s natural<br>aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect--she<br>did at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And if once a<br>girl’s heart is moved to _pity_, it’s more dangerous than anything. She<br>is bound to want to ‘save him,’ to bring him to his senses, and lift<br>him up and draw him to nobler aims, and restore him to new life and<br>usefulness--well, we all know how far such dreams can go. I saw at once<br>that the bird was flying into the cage of herself. And I too made ready.<br>I think you are frowning, Rodion Romanovitch? There’s no need. As you<br>know, it all ended in smoke. (Hang it all, what a lot I am drinking!)<br>Do you know, I always, from the very beginning, regretted that it wasn’t<br>your sister’s fate to be born in the second or third century A.D., as<br>the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia<br>Minor. She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure<br>martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot<br>pincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And in the fourth or<br>fifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and<br>would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and<br>visions. She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and<br>if she can’t get her torture, she’ll throw herself out of a window. I’ve<br>heard something of a Mr. Razumihin--he’s said to be a sensible fellow;<br>his surname suggests it, indeed. He’s probably a divinity student. Well,<br>he’d better look after your sister! I believe I understand her, and I am<br>proud of it. But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one<br>is apt to be more heedless and stupid. One doesn’t see clearly. Hang it<br>all, why is she so handsome? It’s not my fault. In fact, it began on<br>my side with a most irresistible physical desire. Avdotya Romanovna is<br>awfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so. Take note, I tell you<br>this about your sister as a fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, in<br>spite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way. There<br>happened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed<br>wench, whom I had never seen before--she had just come from another<br>village--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears,<br>wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.<br>One day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in<br>the garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parasha<br>alone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, of course,<br>was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted,<br>embarrassed, in fact played my part not badly. Then came interviews,<br>mysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even<br>tears--would you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for<br>propaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on<br>my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally<br>resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the<br>female heart, a weapon which never fails one. It’s the well-known<br>resource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the<br>truth and nothing easier than flattery. If there’s the hundredth part<br>of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that<br>leads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it<br>is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be<br>a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the<br>flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That’s so for all<br>stages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might be<br>seduced by flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I once<br>seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her<br>principles. What fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really<br>had principles--of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply being<br>utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered her<br>shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of<br>the hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for having<br>snatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that<br>I could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.<br>I maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my<br>treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on. In<br>fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was<br>innocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and<br>had succumbed quite by accident. And how angry she was with me when I<br>explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was<br>just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of<br>flattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her property<br>settled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine<br>now and talking too much.) I hope you won’t be angry if I mention now<br>that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.<br>But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. Avdotya Romanovna had<br>several times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by<br>the expression of my eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes a<br>light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and<br>more unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need to go into detail,<br>but we parted. There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in the<br>coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha<br>came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a<br>tremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your<br>sister’s eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at this<br>moment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.<br>I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of<br>her dress was more than I could stand at last. I really began to think<br>that I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I could<br>be moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled,<br>but by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what<br>a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertake<br>anything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya<br>Romanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that’s not the word...<br>but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she lived by<br>her work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you<br>are frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirty<br>thousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away with<br>me here, to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love,<br>rapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her at that time<br>that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat<br>and to marry herself, it would have been done at once! But it ended in<br>the catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic I<br>was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly<br>attorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would<br>really have been just the same thing as I was proposing. Wouldn’t it?<br>Wouldn’t it? I notice that you’ve begun to be very attentive... you<br>interesting young man....”<br><br>Svidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently. He was flushed.<br>Raskolnikov saw clearly that the glass or glass and a half of champagne<br>that he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him--and he<br>resolved to take advantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspicious<br>of Svidrigaïlov.<br><br>“Well, after what you have said, I am fully convinced that you have<br>come to Petersburg with designs on my sister,” he said directly to<br>Svidrigaïlov, in order to irritate him further.<br><br>“Oh, nonsense,” said Svidrigaïlov, seeming to rouse himself. “Why, I<br>told you... besides your sister can’t endure me.”<br><br>“Yes, I am certain that she can’t, but that’s not the point.”<br><br>“Are you so sure that she can’t?” Svidrigaïlov screwed up his eyes and<br>smiled mockingly. “You are right, she doesn’t love me, but you can<br>never be sure of what has passed between husband and wife or lover and<br>mistress. There’s always a little corner which remains a secret to<br>the world and is only known to those two. Will you answer for it that<br>Avdotya Romanovna regarded me with aversion?”<br><br>“From some words you’ve dropped, I notice that you still have<br>designs--and of course evil ones--on Dounia and mean to carry them out<br>promptly.”<br><br>“What, have I dropped words like that?” Svidrigaïlov asked in naïve<br>dismay, taking not the slightest notice of the epithet bestowed on his<br>designs.<br><br>“Why, you are dropping them even now. Why are you so frightened? What<br>are you so afraid of now?”<br><br>“Me--afraid? Afraid of you? You have rather to be afraid of me, _cher<br>ami_. But what nonsense.... I’ve drunk too much though, I see that. I<br>was almost saying too much again. Damn the wine! Hi! there, water!”<br><br>He snatched up the champagne bottle and flung it without ceremony out of<br>the window. Philip brought the water.<br><br>“That’s all nonsense!” said Svidrigaïlov, wetting a towel and putting it<br>to his head. “But I can answer you in one word and annihilate all your<br>suspicions. Do you know that I am going to get married?”<br><br>“You told me so before.”<br><br>“Did I? I’ve forgotten. But I couldn’t have told you so for certain for<br>I had not even seen my betrothed; I only meant to. But now I really<br>have a betrothed and it’s a settled thing, and if it weren’t that I have<br>business that can’t be put off, I would have taken you to see them<br>at once, for I should like to ask your advice. Ach, hang it, only ten<br>minutes left! See, look at the watch. But I must tell you, for it’s an<br>interesting story, my marriage, in its own way. Where are you off to?<br>Going again?”<br><br>“No, I’m not going away now.”<br><br>“Not at all? We shall see. I’ll take you there, I’ll show you my<br>betrothed, only not now. For you’ll soon have to be off. You have to go<br>to the right and I to the left. Do you know that Madame Resslich, the<br>woman I am lodging with now, eh? I know what you’re thinking, that she’s<br>the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come, are<br>you listening? She arranged it all for me. You’re bored, she said,<br>you want something to fill up your time. For, you know, I am a gloomy,<br>depressed person. Do you think I’m light-hearted? No, I’m gloomy. I do<br>no harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a<br>time. And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she has<br>got in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and<br>depart, and she’ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in our<br>class, of course, or higher. She told me the father was a broken-down<br>retired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last three<br>years with his legs paralysed. The mamma, she said, was a sensible<br>woman. There is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesn’t help;<br>there is a daughter, who is married, but she doesn’t visit them. And<br>they’ve two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children<br>were not enough, and they’ve taken from school their youngest daughter,<br>a girl who’ll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can be<br>married. She was for me. We went there. How funny it was! I present<br>myself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections,<br>with a fortune. What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks<br>of that? But it’s fascinating, isn’t it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! You<br>should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth paying<br>to have seen me at that moment. She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy,<br>still in a short frock--an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset--she had<br>been told, no doubt. I don’t know how you feel about female faces, but<br>to my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears<br>of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little<br>picture, too. Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb’s, full little rosy<br>lips, tiny feet, a charmer!... Well, we made friends. I told them I was<br>in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is<br>the day before yesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on<br>my knee at once and keep her there.... Well, she flushes like a sunset<br>and I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of course impresses on her that<br>this is her husband and that this must be so. It’s simply delicious! The<br>present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you<br>have what is called _la nature et la vérité_, ha-ha! I’ve talked to her<br>twice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at me that<br>positively scorches me. Her face is like Raphael’s Madonna. You know,<br>the Sistine Madonna’s face has something fantastic in it, the face<br>of mournful religious ecstasy. Haven’t you noticed it? Well, she’s<br>something in that line. The day after we’d been betrothed, I bought her<br>presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds and<br>another of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all<br>sorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna’s face glowed. I sat her<br>on my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously--she<br>flushed crimson and the tears started, but she didn’t want to show it.<br>We were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first<br>time of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, and<br>vowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make<br>me happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, would<br>sacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is<br>my _respect_, and that she wants ‘nothing, nothing more from me, no<br>presents.’ You’ll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an<br>angel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flush<br>of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is<br>rather fascinating! Isn’t it fascinating? It’s worth paying for, isn’t<br>it? Well... listen, we’ll go to see my betrothed, only not just now!”<br><br>“The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites<br>your sensuality! Will you really make such a marriage?”<br><br>“Why, of course. Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily who<br>knows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! But why are you so keen about<br>virtue? Have mercy on me, my good friend. I am a sinful man. Ha-ha-ha!”<br><br>“But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna. Though...<br>though you had your own reasons.... I understand it all now.”<br><br>“I am always fond of children, very fond of them,” laughed Svidrigaïlov.<br>“I can tell you one curious instance of it. The first day I came here I<br>visited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them. You<br>probably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my<br>old friends. I shall do without them as long as I can. Do you know, when<br>I was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thought<br>of these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great<br>deal. Yes, upon my soul! The peasants have vodka, the educated young<br>people, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams<br>and visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are<br>amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery. From<br>the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours. I chanced to be<br>in a frightful den--I like my dens dirty--it was a dance, so called, and<br>there was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you<br>have progress. All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely<br>dressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one<br>_vis-à-vis_. Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You can’t<br>fancy what a _cancan_ that was! The girl was ashamed, blushed, at<br>last felt insulted, and began to cry. Her partner seized her and began<br>whirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--I<br>like your public, even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted,<br>‘Serves her right--serves her right! Shouldn’t bring children!’ Well,<br>it’s not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or<br>not. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began by<br>saying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and<br>that they couldn’t distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect,<br>gave her to understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them<br>home in my carriage. I took them home and got to know them. They were<br>lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the<br>country. She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my<br>acquaintance as an honour. I found out that they had nothing of their<br>own and had come to town upon some legal business. I proffered my<br>services and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon<br>by mistake, believing that it was a genuine dancing class. I offered to<br>assist in the young girl’s education in French and dancing. My offer was<br>accepted with enthusiasm as an honour--and we are still friendly.... If<br>you like, we’ll go and see them, only not just now.”<br><br>“Stop! Enough of your vile, nasty anecdotes, depraved vile, sensual<br>man!”<br><br>“Schiller, you are a regular Schiller! _O la vertu va-t-elle se nicher?_<br>But you know I shall tell you these things on purpose, for the pleasure<br>of hearing your outcries!”<br><br>“I dare say. I can see I am ridiculous myself,” muttered Raskolnikov<br>angrily.<br><br>Svidrigaïlov laughed heartily; finally he called Philip, paid his bill,<br>and began getting up.<br><br>“I say, but I am drunk, _assez causé_,” he said. “It’s been a pleasure.”<br><br>“I should rather think it must be a pleasure!” cried Raskolnikov,<br>getting up. “No doubt it is a pleasure for a worn-out profligate to<br>describe such adventures with a monstrous project of the same sort in<br>his mind--especially under such circumstances and to such a man as<br>me.... It’s stimulating!”<br><br>“Well, if you come to that,” Svidrigaïlov answered, scrutinising<br>Raskolnikov with some surprise, “if you come to that, you are a thorough<br>cynic yourself. You’ve plenty to make you so, anyway. You can understand<br>a great deal... and you can do a great deal too. But enough. I sincerely<br>regret not having had more talk with you, but I shan’t lose sight of<br>you.... Only wait a bit.”<br><br>Svidrigaïlov walked out of the restaurant. Raskolnikov walked out after<br>him. Svidrigaïlov was not however very drunk, the wine had affected him<br>for a moment, but it was passing off every minute. He was preoccupied<br>with something of importance and was frowning. He was apparently excited<br>and uneasy in anticipation of something. His manner to Raskolnikov had<br>changed during the last few minutes, and he was ruder and more sneering<br>every moment. Raskolnikov noticed all this, and he too was uneasy. He<br>became very suspicious of Svidrigaïlov and resolved to follow him.<br><br>They came out on to the pavement.<br><br>“You go to the right, and I to the left, or if you like, the other way.<br>Only _adieu, mon plaisir_, may we meet again.”<br><br>And he walked to the right towards the Hay Market.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER V<br><br>Raskolnikov walked after him.<br><br>“What’s this?” cried Svidrigaïlov turning round, “I thought I said...”<br><br>“It means that I am not going to lose sight of you now.”<br><br>“What?”<br><br>Both stood still and gazed at one another, as though measuring their<br>strength.<br><br>“From all your half tipsy stories,” Raskolnikov observed harshly, “I am<br>_positive_ that you have not given up your designs on my sister, but<br>are pursuing them more actively than ever. I have learnt that my sister<br>received a letter this morning. You have hardly been able to sit still<br>all this time.... You may have unearthed a wife on the way, but that<br>means nothing. I should like to make certain myself.”<br><br>Raskolnikov could hardly have said himself what he wanted and of what he<br>wished to make certain.<br><br>“Upon my word! I’ll call the police!”<br><br>“Call away!”<br><br>Again they stood for a minute facing each other. At last Svidrigaïlov’s<br>face changed. Having satisfied himself that Raskolnikov was not<br>frightened at his threat, he assumed a mirthful and friendly air.<br><br>“What a fellow! I purposely refrained from referring to your affair,<br>though I am devoured by curiosity. It’s a fantastic affair. I’ve put it<br>off till another time, but you’re enough to rouse the dead.... Well, let<br>us go, only I warn you beforehand I am only going home for a moment,<br>to get some money; then I shall lock up the flat, take a cab and go to<br>spend the evening at the Islands. Now, now are you going to follow me?”<br><br>“I’m coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, to<br>say I’m sorry not to have been at the funeral.”<br><br>“That’s as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. She has taken<br>the three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of some<br>orphan asylums, whom I used to know years ago. I charmed the old lady by<br>depositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of<br>Katerina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well. I told her<br>too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing.<br>It produced an indescribable effect on her. That’s why Sofya Semyonovna<br>has been invited to call to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady is<br>staying for the time.”<br><br>“No matter, I’ll come all the same.”<br><br>“As you like, it’s nothing to me, but I won’t come with you; here we are<br>at home. By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion<br>just because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled<br>you with questions... you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I<br>don’t mind betting it’s that. Well, it teaches one to show delicacy!”<br><br>“And to listen at doors!”<br><br>“Ah, that’s it, is it?” laughed Svidrigaïlov. “Yes, I should have been<br>surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened. Ha-ha!<br>Though I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and<br>were telling Sofya Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it? Perhaps<br>I am quite behind the times and can’t understand. For goodness’ sake,<br>explain it, my dear boy. Expound the latest theories!”<br><br>“You couldn’t have heard anything. You’re making it all up!”<br><br>“But I’m not talking about that (though I did hear something). No, I’m<br>talking of the way you keep sighing and groaning now. The Schiller in<br>you is in revolt every moment, and now you tell me not to listen at<br>doors. If that’s how you feel, go and inform the police that you had<br>this mischance: you made a little mistake in your theory. But if you are<br>convinced that one mustn’t listen at doors, but one may murder old women<br>at one’s pleasure, you’d better be off to America and make haste. Run,<br>young man! There may still be time. I’m speaking sincerely. Haven’t you<br>the money? I’ll give you the fare.”<br><br>“I’m not thinking of that at all,” Raskolnikov interrupted with disgust.<br><br>“I understand (but don’t put yourself out, don’t discuss it if you don’t<br>want to). I understand the questions you are worrying over--moral ones,<br>aren’t they? Duties of citizen and man? Lay them all aside. They are<br>nothing to you now, ha-ha! You’ll say you are still a man and a citizen.<br>If so you ought not to have got into this coil. It’s no use taking up a<br>job you are not fit for. Well, you’d better shoot yourself, or don’t you<br>want to?”<br><br>“You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you.”<br><br>“What a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the staircase. You<br>see, that’s the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, there is no one at home.<br>Don’t you believe me? Ask Kapernaumov. She leaves the key with him. Here<br>is Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She is rather deaf. Has she<br>gone out? Where? Did you hear? She is not in and won’t be till late in<br>the evening probably. Well, come to my room; you wanted to come and see<br>me, didn’t you? Here we are. Madame Resslich’s not at home. She is a<br>woman who is always busy, an excellent woman I assure you.... She might<br>have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. Now,<br>see! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau--see what a lot<br>I’ve got of them still--this one will be turned into cash to-day. I<br>mustn’t waste any more time. The bureau is locked, the flat is locked,<br>and here we are again on the stairs. Shall we take a cab? I’m going to<br>the Islands. Would you like a lift? I’ll take this carriage. Ah, you<br>refuse? You are tired of it! Come for a drive! I believe it will come on<br>to rain. Never mind, we’ll put down the hood....”<br><br>Svidrigaïlov was already in the carriage. Raskolnikov decided that his<br>suspicions were at least for that moment unjust. Without answering a<br>word he turned and walked back towards the Hay Market. If he had only<br>turned round on his way he might have seen Svidrigaïlov get out not a<br>hundred paces off, dismiss the cab and walk along the pavement. But he<br>had turned the corner and could see nothing. Intense disgust drew him<br>away from Svidrigaïlov.<br><br>“To think that I could for one instant have looked for help from that<br>coarse brute, that depraved sensualist and blackguard!” he cried.<br><br>Raskolnikov’s judgment was uttered too lightly and hastily: there was<br>something about Svidrigaïlov which gave him a certain original, even a<br>mysterious character. As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced<br>that Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace. But it was too tiresome<br>and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this.<br><br>When he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, as<br>usual, into deep thought. On the bridge he stood by the railing and<br>began gazing at the water. And his sister was standing close by him.<br><br>He met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing<br>her. Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was<br>struck with dismay. She stood still and did not know whether to call<br>to him or not. Suddenly she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the<br>direction of the Hay Market.<br><br>He seemed to be approaching cautiously. He did not go on to the<br>bridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoid<br>Raskolnikov’s seeing him. He had observed Dounia for some time and had<br>been making signs to her. She fancied he was signalling to beg her not<br>to speak to her brother, but to come to him.<br><br>That was what Dounia did. She stole by her brother and went up to<br>Svidrigaïlov.<br><br>“Let us make haste away,” Svidrigaïlov whispered to her, “I don’t want<br>Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting. I must tell you I’ve been<br>sitting with him in the restaurant close by, where he looked me up and<br>I had great difficulty in getting rid of him. He has somehow heard of<br>my letter to you and suspects something. It wasn’t you who told him, of<br>course, but if not you, who then?”<br><br>“Well, we’ve turned the corner now,” Dounia interrupted, “and my brother<br>won’t see us. I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.<br>Speak to me here. You can tell it all in the street.”<br><br>“In the first place, I can’t say it in the street; secondly, you must<br>hear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....<br>Oh well, if you won’t agree to come with me, I shall refuse to give<br>any explanation and go away at once. But I beg you not to forget that<br>a very curious secret of your beloved brother’s is entirely in my<br>keeping.”<br><br>Dounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at Svidrigaïlov with<br>searching eyes.<br><br>“What are you afraid of?” he observed quietly. “The town is not the<br>country. And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you.”<br><br>“Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?”<br><br>“No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she<br>is at home now. But most likely she is. She has buried her stepmother<br>to-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day. For the time I<br>don’t want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken<br>to you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like<br>this. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That’s the porter<br>of our house--he knows me very well; you see, he’s bowing; he sees I’m<br>coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you<br>will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse<br>my putting things so coarsely. I haven’t a flat to myself; Sofya<br>Semyonovna’s room is next to mine--she lodges in the next flat. The<br>whole floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child?<br>Am I really so terrible?”<br><br>Svidrigaïlov’s lips were twisted in a condescending smile; but he was in<br>no smiling mood. His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.<br>He spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement. But Dounia did not<br>notice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark that<br>she was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to<br>her.<br><br>“Though I know that you are not a man... of honour, I am not in the<br>least afraid of you. Lead the way,” she said with apparent composure,<br>but her face was very pale.<br><br>Svidrigaïlov stopped at Sonia’s room.<br><br>“Allow me to inquire whether she is at home.... She is not. How<br>unfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon. If she’s gone out, it<br>can only be to see a lady about the orphans. Their mother is dead....<br>I’ve been meddling and making arrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna<br>does not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if<br>you like. This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich,<br>my landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way. I will show you<br>my chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two<br>perfectly empty rooms, which are to let. Here they are... You must look<br>into them with some attention.”<br><br>Svidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. Dounia was<br>looking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the<br>furniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was something to observe,<br>for instance, that Svidrigaïlov’s flat was exactly between two sets of<br>almost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directly<br>from the passage, but through the landlady’s two almost empty rooms.<br>Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia<br>the two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not<br>knowing what she was called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened to<br>explain.<br><br>“Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, it’s locked.<br>By the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms. I brought it<br>from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently. Just the other side of<br>the door is Sofya Semyonovna’s table; she sat there talking to Rodion<br>Romanovitch. And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, for<br>two hours each time--and of course I was able to learn something, what<br>do you think?”<br><br>“You listened?”<br><br>“Yes, I did. Now come back to my room; we can’t sit down here.”<br><br>He brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her<br>a chair. He sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven<br>feet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which<br>had once frightened Dounia so much. She shuddered and once more looked<br>about her distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she evidently<br>did not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the secluded position of<br>Svidrigaïlov’s lodging had suddenly struck her. She wanted to ask<br>whether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her from<br>asking. Moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparably<br>greater than fear for herself. She was in great distress.<br><br>“Here is your letter,” she said, laying it on the table. “Can it be true<br>what you write? You hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother.<br>You hint at it too clearly; you daren’t deny it now. I must tell you<br>that I’d heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don’t believe a<br>word of it. It’s a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the story<br>and why and how it was invented. You can have no proofs. You promised to<br>prove it. Speak! But let me warn you that I don’t believe you! I don’t<br>believe you!”<br><br>Dounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour<br>rushed to her face.<br><br>“If you didn’t believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms?<br>Why have you come? Simply from curiosity?”<br><br>“Don’t torment me. Speak, speak!”<br><br>“There’s no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my word, I thought<br>you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here. But he was not<br>with you nor anywhere near. I was on the look-out. It’s spirited of<br>you, it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everything<br>is divine in you.... About your brother, what am I to say to you? You’ve<br>just seen him yourself. What did you think of him?”<br><br>“Surely that’s not the only thing you are building on?”<br><br>“No, not on that, but on his own words. He came here on two successive<br>evenings to see Sofya Semyonovna. I’ve shown you where they sat. He made<br>a full confession to her. He is a murderer. He killed an old woman, a<br>pawnbroker, with whom he had pawned things himself. He killed her sister<br>too, a pedlar woman called Lizaveta, who happened to come in while he<br>was murdering her sister. He killed them with an axe he brought with<br>him. He murdered them to rob them and he did rob them. He took money and<br>various things.... He told all this, word for word, to Sofya Semyonovna,<br>the only person who knows his secret. But she has had no share by word<br>or deed in the murder; she was as horrified at it as you are now. Don’t<br>be anxious, she won’t betray him.”<br><br>“It cannot be,” muttered Dounia, with white lips. She gasped for breath.<br>“It cannot be. There was not the slightest cause, no sort of ground....<br>It’s a lie, a lie!”<br><br>“He robbed her, that was the cause, he took money and things. It’s true<br>that by his own admission he made no use of the money or things, but hid<br>them under a stone, where they are now. But that was because he dared<br>not make use of them.”<br><br>“But how could he steal, rob? How could he dream of it?” cried Dounia,<br>and she jumped up from the chair. “Why, you know him, and you’ve seen<br>him, can he be a thief?”<br><br>She seemed to be imploring Svidrigaïlov; she had entirely forgotten her<br>fear.<br><br>“There are thousands and millions of combinations and possibilities,<br>Avdotya Romanovna. A thief steals and knows he is a scoundrel, but I’ve<br>heard of a gentleman who broke open the mail. Who knows, very likely he<br>thought he was doing a gentlemanly thing! Of course I should not have<br>believed it myself if I’d been told of it as you have, but I believe my<br>own ears. He explained all the causes of it to Sofya Semyonovna too, but<br>she did not believe her ears at first, yet she believed her own eyes at<br>last.”<br><br>“What... were the causes?”<br><br>“It’s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Here’s... how shall I tell<br>you?--A theory of a sort, the same one by which I for instance consider<br>that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, a<br>solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds! It’s galling too, of<br>course, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if<br>he had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his<br>whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three<br>thousand. Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging<br>in a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his social<br>position and his sister’s and mother’s position too. Above all, vanity,<br>pride and vanity, though goodness knows he may have good qualities<br>too.... I am not blaming him, please don’t think it; besides, it’s not<br>my business. A special little theory came in too--a theory of a<br>sort--dividing mankind, you see, into material and superior persons,<br>that is persons to whom the law does not apply owing to their<br>superiority, who make laws for the rest of mankind, the material, that<br>is. It’s all right as a theory, _une théorie comme une autre_. Napoleon<br>attracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that a<br>great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrongdoing, but have<br>overstepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied<br>that he was a genius too--that is, he was convinced of it for a time. He<br>has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he<br>could make a theory, but was incapable of boldly overstepping the law,<br>and so he is not a man of genius. And that’s humiliating for a young man<br>of any pride, in our day especially....”<br><br>“But remorse? You deny him any moral feeling then? Is he like that?”<br><br>“Ah, Avdotya Romanovna, everything is in a muddle now; not that it was<br>ever in very good order. Russians in general are broad in their ideas,<br>Avdotya Romanovna, broad like their land and exceedingly disposed to<br>the fantastic, the chaotic. But it’s a misfortune to be broad without<br>a special genius. Do you remember what a lot of talk we had together on<br>this subject, sitting in the evenings on the terrace after supper? Why,<br>you used to reproach me with breadth! Who knows, perhaps we were talking<br>at the very time when he was lying here thinking over his plan. There<br>are no sacred traditions amongst us, especially in the educated class,<br>Avdotya Romanovna. At the best someone will make them up somehow for<br>himself out of books or from some old chronicle. But those are for the<br>most part the learned and all old fogeys, so that it would be almost<br>ill-bred in a man of society. You know my opinions in general, though. I<br>never blame anyone. I do nothing at all, I persevere in that. But<br>we’ve talked of this more than once before. I was so happy indeed as to<br>interest you in my opinions.... You are very pale, Avdotya Romanovna.”<br><br>“I know his theory. I read that article of his about men to whom all is<br>permitted. Razumihin brought it to me.”<br><br>“Mr. Razumihin? Your brother’s article? In a magazine? Is there such an<br>article? I didn’t know. It must be interesting. But where are you going,<br>Avdotya Romanovna?”<br><br>“I want to see Sofya Semyonovna,” Dounia articulated faintly. “How do I<br>go to her? She has come in, perhaps. I must see her at once. Perhaps<br>she...”<br><br>Avdotya Romanovna could not finish. Her breath literally failed her.<br><br>“Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at least I believe not.<br>She was to have been back at once, but if not, then she will not be in<br>till quite late.”<br><br>“Ah, then you are lying! I see... you were lying... lying all the<br>time.... I don’t believe you! I don’t believe you!” cried Dounia,<br>completely losing her head.<br><br>Almost fainting, she sank on to a chair which Svidrigaïlov made haste to<br>give her.<br><br>“Avdotya Romanovna, what is it? Control yourself! Here is some water.<br>Drink a little....”<br><br>He sprinkled some water over her. Dounia shuddered and came to herself.<br><br>“It has acted violently,” Svidrigaïlov muttered to himself, frowning.<br>“Avdotya Romanovna, calm yourself! Believe me, he has friends. We will<br>save him. Would you like me to take him abroad? I have money, I can get<br>a ticket in three days. And as for the murder, he will do all sorts of<br>good deeds yet, to atone for it. Calm yourself. He may become a great<br>man yet. Well, how are you? How do you feel?”<br><br>“Cruel man! To be able to jeer at it! Let me go...”<br><br>“Where are you going?”<br><br>“To him. Where is he? Do you know? Why is this door locked? We came in<br>at that door and now it is locked. When did you manage to lock it?”<br><br>“We couldn’t be shouting all over the flat on such a subject. I am far<br>from jeering; it’s simply that I’m sick of talking like this. But how<br>can you go in such a state? Do you want to betray him? You will drive<br>him to fury, and he will give himself up. Let me tell you, he is already<br>being watched; they are already on his track. You will simply be giving<br>him away. Wait a little: I saw him and was talking to him just now. He<br>can still be saved. Wait a bit, sit down; let us think it over together.<br>I asked you to come in order to discuss it alone with you and to<br>consider it thoroughly. But do sit down!”<br><br>“How can you save him? Can he really be saved?”<br><br>Dounia sat down. Svidrigaïlov sat down beside her.<br><br>“It all depends on you, on you, on you alone,” he began with glowing<br>eyes, almost in a whisper and hardly able to utter the words for<br>emotion.<br><br>Dounia drew back from him in alarm. He too was trembling all over.<br><br>“You... one word from you, and he is saved. I... I’ll save him. I have<br>money and friends. I’ll send him away at once. I’ll get a passport,<br>two passports, one for him and one for me. I have friends... capable<br>people.... If you like, I’ll take a passport for you... for your<br>mother.... What do you want with Razumihin? I love you too.... I love<br>you beyond everything.... Let me kiss the hem of your dress, let me, let<br>me.... The very rustle of it is too much for me. Tell me, ‘do that,’<br>and I’ll do it. I’ll do everything. I will do the impossible. What you<br>believe, I will believe. I’ll do anything--anything! Don’t, don’t look<br>at me like that. Do you know that you are killing me?...”<br><br>He was almost beginning to rave.... Something seemed suddenly to go to<br>his head. Dounia jumped up and rushed to the door.<br><br>“Open it! Open it!” she called, shaking the door. “Open it! Is there no<br>one there?”<br><br>Svidrigaïlov got up and came to himself. His still trembling lips slowly<br>broke into an angry mocking smile.<br><br>“There is no one at home,” he said quietly and emphatically. “The<br>landlady has gone out, and it’s waste of time to shout like that. You<br>are only exciting yourself uselessly.”<br><br>“Where is the key? Open the door at once, at once, base man!”<br><br>“I have lost the key and cannot find it.”<br><br>“This is an outrage,” cried Dounia, turning pale as death. She rushed<br>to the furthest corner, where she made haste to barricade herself with a<br>little table.<br><br>She did not scream, but she fixed her eyes on her tormentor and watched<br>every movement he made.<br><br>Svidrigaïlov remained standing at the other end of the room facing her.<br>He was positively composed, at least in appearance, but his face was<br>pale as before. The mocking smile did not leave his face.<br><br>“You spoke of outrage just now, Avdotya Romanovna. In that case you<br>may be sure I’ve taken measures. Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. The<br>Kapernaumovs are far away--there are five locked rooms between. I am at<br>least twice as strong as you are and I have nothing to fear, besides.<br>For you could not complain afterwards. You surely would not be willing<br>actually to betray your brother? Besides, no one would believe you. How<br>should a girl have come alone to visit a solitary man in his lodgings?<br>So that even if you do sacrifice your brother, you could prove nothing.<br>It is very difficult to prove an assault, Avdotya Romanovna.”<br><br>“Scoundrel!” whispered Dounia indignantly.<br><br>“As you like, but observe I was only speaking by way of a general<br>proposition. It’s my personal conviction that you are perfectly<br>right--violence is hateful. I only spoke to show you that you need have<br>no remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your<br>own accord, as I suggest to you. You would be simply submitting to<br>circumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word. Think<br>about it. Your brother’s and your mother’s fate are in your hands. I<br>will be your slave... all my life... I will wait here.”<br><br>Svidrigaïlov sat down on the sofa about eight steps from Dounia. She had<br>not the slightest doubt now of his unbending determination. Besides, she<br>knew him. Suddenly she pulled out of her pocket a revolver, cocked it<br>and laid it in her hand on the table. Svidrigaïlov jumped up.<br><br>“Aha! So that’s it, is it?” he cried, surprised but smiling maliciously.<br>“Well, that completely alters the aspect of affairs. You’ve made things<br>wonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get the<br>revolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? Why, it’s my revolver, an old friend!<br>And how I’ve hunted for it! The shooting lessons I’ve given you in the<br>country have not been thrown away.”<br><br>“It’s not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed,<br>wretch! There was nothing of yours in her house. I took it when I began<br>to suspect what you were capable of. If you dare to advance one step, I<br>swear I’ll kill you.” She was frantic.<br><br>“But your brother? I ask from curiosity,” said Svidrigaïlov, still<br>standing where he was.<br><br>“Inform, if you want to! Don’t stir! Don’t come nearer! I’ll shoot! You<br>poisoned your wife, I know; you are a murderer yourself!” She held the<br>revolver ready.<br><br>“Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?”<br><br>“You did! You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison.... I know<br>you went to get it... you had it in readiness.... It was your doing....<br>It must have been your doing.... Scoundrel!”<br><br>“Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake... you would<br>have been the cause.”<br><br>“You are lying! I hated you always, always....”<br><br>“Oho, Avdotya Romanovna! You seem to have forgotten how you softened<br>to me in the heat of propaganda. I saw it in your eyes. Do you remember<br>that moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?”<br><br>“That’s a lie,” there was a flash of fury in Dounia’s eyes, “that’s a<br>lie and a libel!”<br><br>“A lie? Well, if you like, it’s a lie. I made it up. Women ought not<br>to be reminded of such things,” he smiled. “I know you will shoot, you<br>pretty wild creature. Well, shoot away!”<br><br>Dounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the<br>distance and awaiting the first movement on his part. Her lower lip was<br>white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire. He had<br>never seen her so handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment<br>she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of<br>anguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a shot rang out. The<br>bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind. He stood still and<br>laughed softly.<br><br>“The wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. What’s this?<br>Blood?” he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed<br>in a thin stream down his right temple. The bullet seemed to have just<br>grazed the skin.<br><br>Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much in<br>terror as in a sort of wild amazement. She seemed not to understand what<br>she was doing and what was going on.<br><br>“Well, you missed! Fire again, I’ll wait,” said Svidrigaïlov softly,<br>still smiling, but gloomily. “If you go on like that, I shall have time<br>to seize you before you cock again.”<br><br>Dounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.<br><br>“Let me be,” she cried in despair. “I swear I’ll shoot again. I... I’ll<br>kill you.”<br><br>“Well... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you don’t...<br>then.” His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward. Dounia shot<br>again: it missed fire.<br><br>“You haven’t loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another charge<br>there. Get it ready, I’ll wait.”<br><br>He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild<br>determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. Dounia<br>saw that he would sooner die than let her go. “And... now, of course she<br>would kill him, at two paces!” Suddenly she flung away the revolver.<br><br>“She’s dropped it!” said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he drew a deep<br>breath. A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only<br>the fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.<br>It was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter,<br>which he could not himself have defined.<br><br>He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did not<br>resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.<br>He tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to<br>utter a sound.<br><br>“Let me go,” Dounia implored. Svidrigaïlov shuddered. Her voice now was<br>quite different.<br><br>“Then you don’t love me?” he asked softly. Dounia shook her head.<br><br>“And... and you can’t? Never?” he whispered in despair.<br><br>“Never!”<br><br>There followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of<br>Svidrigaïlov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly<br>he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.<br>Another moment passed.<br><br>“Here’s the key.”<br><br>He took it out of the left pocket of his coat and laid it on the table<br>behind him, without turning or looking at Dounia.<br><br>“Take it! Make haste!”<br><br>He looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table to<br>take the key.<br><br>“Make haste! Make haste!” repeated Svidrigaïlov, still without turning<br>or moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that<br>“make haste.”<br><br>Dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it<br>quickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later, beside herself, she<br>ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.<br><br>Svidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last he<br>slowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. A<br>strange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of<br>despair. The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.<br>He looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.<br>The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly<br>caught his eye. He picked it up and examined it. It was a little pocket<br>three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were still<br>two charges and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He<br>thought a little, put the revolver in his pocket, took his hat and went<br>out.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VI<br><br>He spent that evening till ten o’clock going from one low haunt to<br>another. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain<br><br>“villain and tyrant,”<br><br>“began kissing Katia.”<br><br>Svidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and<br>the waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these<br>clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the<br>left and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure<br>garden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky<br>three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a<br>“Vauxhall,” which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was<br>served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.<br>A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed<br>German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The<br>clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.<br>Svidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for<br>a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no<br>possibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was<br>that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in<br>selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his<br>companion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon<br>belonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem<br>troublesome. Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of<br>the garden. It was about six o’clock. He had not drunk a drop of wine<br>all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than<br>anything.<br><br>It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over<br>the sky about ten o’clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain<br>came down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the<br>earth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each<br>flash lasted while one could count five.<br><br>Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the<br>bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then,<br>putting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes,<br>but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the<br>rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room<br>without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.<br><br>She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She<br>was giving them tea. She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence,<br>looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at<br>once in indescribable terror.<br><br>Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.<br>She timidly prepared to listen.<br><br>“I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,” said Svidrigaïlov, “and<br>as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some<br>arrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to<br>you, you need not tell me.” (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) “Those<br>people have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your<br>brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them<br>I’ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had<br>better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take<br>them! Well now, that’s settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the<br>value of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for<br>yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one<br>knows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on<br>living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no<br>need for it now.”<br><br>“I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my<br>stepmother,” said Sonia hurriedly, “and if I’ve said so little... please<br>don’t consider...”<br><br>“That’s enough! that’s enough!”<br><br>“But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you,<br>but I don’t need it now. I can always earn my own living. Don’t think me<br>ungrateful. If you are so charitable, that money....”<br><br>“It’s for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don’t waste words<br>over it. I haven’t time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch<br>has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia.” (Sonia looked<br>wildly at him, and started.) “Don’t be uneasy, I know all about it from<br>himself and I am not a gossip; I won’t tell anyone. It was good advice<br>when you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much<br>better for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and<br>you will follow him. That’s so, isn’t it? And if so, you’ll need money.<br>You’ll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same<br>as my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay<br>what’s owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so<br>heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt and not<br>yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.<br>You can’t get through the world like that. If you are ever questioned<br>about me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--don’t say<br>anything about my coming to see you now and don’t show the money to<br>anyone or say a word about it. Well, now good-bye.” (He got up.) “My<br>greetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you’d better put the money<br>for the present in Mr. Razumihin’s keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Of<br>course you do. He’s not a bad fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or...<br>when the time comes. And till then, hide it carefully.”<br><br>Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov.<br>She longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she<br>did not dare and did not know how to begin.<br><br>“How can you... how can you be going now, in such rain?”<br><br>“Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! Ha, ha! Good-bye,<br>Sofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and live long, you will be of use to<br>others. By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him.<br>Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greetings. Be sure<br>to.”<br><br>He went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague<br>apprehension.<br><br>It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven,<br>he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still<br>persisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where<br>the parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky<br>Island. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit<br>at first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov could be<br>very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very<br>intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidrigaïlov had<br>probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing<br>vanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see<br>Svidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the<br>conversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct<br>question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she<br>were obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when Svidrigaïlov<br>would like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and<br>almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only<br>by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other<br>occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady<br>Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his<br>betrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she<br>had already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.<br><br>Svidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important<br>affairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her<br>fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from<br>him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present<br>before their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his<br>immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that<br>purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went<br>off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,<br>the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the<br>other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced<br>by tears from the most sensible of mothers. Svidrigaïlov got up,<br>laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon<br>come back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a<br>sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though<br>he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be<br>immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He<br>went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but<br>the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of<br>the most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidrigaïlov was<br>a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great<br>wealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start<br>off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that<br>there was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he<br>was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,<br>and all these people of high society didn’t think of what was said of<br>them and didn’t stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like that<br>on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a<br>word should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and<br>the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the<br>cook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said<br>to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up<br>whispering till two o’clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier,<br>amazed and rather sorrowful.<br><br>Svidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the<br>way back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring<br>wind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black<br>waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.<br>But he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and<br>went towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long<br>time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the<br>wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side<br>of the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that<br>there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly<br>large, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was<br>not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place<br>that he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long,<br>blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were<br>lights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked<br>a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,<br>scanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a<br>close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under<br>the stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow<br>looked inquiringly.<br><br>“Is there tea?” asked Svidrigaïlov.<br><br>“Yes, sir.”<br><br>“What else is there?”<br><br>“Veal, vodka, savouries.”<br><br>“Bring me tea and veal.”<br><br>“And you want nothing else?” he asked with apparent surprise.<br><br>“Nothing, nothing.”<br><br>The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.<br><br>“It must be a nice place,” thought Svidrigaïlov. “How was it I didn’t<br>know it? I expect I look as if I came from a café chantant and have<br>had some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stayed<br>here?”<br><br>He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a<br>room so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it;<br>it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained<br>chair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they<br>were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty<br>that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general<br>colour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short<br>by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under<br>the stairs.<br><br>Svidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into<br>thought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout<br>in the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from<br>the moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and<br>almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.<br><br>Svidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw<br>light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The<br>room, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of<br>them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing<br>in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to<br>preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached<br>the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He<br>declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn<br>him out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it<br>all. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the<br>air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can’t. He sometimes<br>turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not<br>the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A<br>candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly<br>empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs<br>of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, Svidrigaïlov turned away<br>indifferently and sat down on the bed.<br><br>The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking<br>him again whether he didn’t want anything more, and again receiving a<br>negative reply, finally withdrew. Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a<br>glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began<br>to feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the<br>blanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. “It would have been better<br>to be well for the occasion,” he thought with a smile. The room was<br>close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard<br>a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of<br>leather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He<br>felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. “It must be a garden<br>under the window,” he thought. “There’s a sound of trees. How I dislike<br>the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one a<br>horrid feeling.” He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed<br>Petrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little<br>Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. “I never have<br>liked water,” he thought, “even in a landscape,” and he suddenly smiled<br>again at a strange idea: “Surely now all these questions of taste and<br>comfort ought not to matter, but I’ve become more particular, like an<br>animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought<br>to have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,<br>ha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, why<br>haven’t I put out the candle?” he blew it out. “They’ve gone to bed next<br>door,” he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. “Well, now, Marfa<br>Petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it’s dark, and the very<br>time and place for you. But now you won’t come!”<br><br>He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on<br>Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin’s<br>keeping. “I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to<br>tease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! He’s gone through a<br>good deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when he’s got over<br>his nonsense. But now he’s _too_ eager for life. These young men<br>are contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him please<br>himself, it’s nothing to do with me.”<br><br>He could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia’s image rose before him,<br>and a shudder ran over him. “No, I must give up all that now,” he<br>thought, rousing himself. “I must think of something else. It’s queer<br>and funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly<br>desired to avenge myself even, and that’s a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad<br>sign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--that’s<br>a bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too--Damnation!<br>But--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me<br>somehow....”<br><br>He ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Dounia’s image<br>rose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,<br>she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that<br>he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand<br>to defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that<br>instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his<br>heart...<br><br>“Aïe! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it away!”<br><br>He was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly<br>something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. He<br>started. “Ugh! hang it! I believe it’s a mouse,” he thought, “that’s the<br>veal I left on the table.” He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the<br>blanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over<br>his leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking<br>with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.<br>He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.<br>He tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without<br>leaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and<br>suddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in one<br>instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down<br>his back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.<br><br>The room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket<br>as before. The wind was howling under the window. “How disgusting,” he<br>thought with annoyance.<br><br>He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the<br>window. “It’s better not to sleep at all,” he decided. There was a cold<br>damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the<br>blanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of<br>anything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another,<br>incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his<br>mind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or<br>the dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees<br>roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling<br>on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,<br>warm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day. A fine, sumptuous country<br>cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with<br>flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was<br>surrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with<br>rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed<br>particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant<br>narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He was<br>reluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came<br>into a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows,<br>the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.<br>The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows<br>were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds were<br>chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table<br>covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was<br>covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of<br>flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a<br>white muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as<br>though carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was<br>a wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of<br>her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her<br>pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.<br>Svidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle<br>beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.<br>She was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed<br>herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish<br>soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn<br>from her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on<br>a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....<br><br>Svidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the<br>window. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously<br>into the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with<br>his shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have been<br>something like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too,<br>probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of<br>rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as<br>in a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of<br>objects. Svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill,<br>gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed<br>by a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. “Ah, the<br>signal! The river is overflowing,” he thought. “By morning it will be<br>swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and<br>cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain<br>and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is<br>it now?” And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on<br>the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.<br><br>“Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll go out at once<br>straight to the park. I’ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,<br>so that as soon as one’s shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on<br>one’s head.”<br><br>He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his<br>waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,<br>into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep<br>somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay<br>him for the room and leave the hotel. “It’s the best minute; I couldn’t<br>choose a better.”<br><br>He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding<br>anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner<br>between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object<br>which seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little<br>girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her<br>clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of<br>Svidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big<br>black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been<br>crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The child’s face<br>was pale and tired, she was numb with cold. “How can she have come here?<br>She must have hidden here and not slept all night.” He began questioning<br>her. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby<br>language, something about “mammy” and that “mammy would beat her,” and<br>about some cup that she had “bwoken.” The child chattered on without<br>stopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a<br>neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service<br>of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken<br>a cup of her mother’s and was so frightened that she had run away the<br>evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the<br>rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and<br>spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness<br>and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his<br>arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing<br>her. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as<br>wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had<br>undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in<br>the blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he<br>sank into dreary musing again.<br><br>“What folly to trouble myself,” he decided suddenly with an oppressive<br>feeling of annoyance. “What idiocy!” In vexation he took up the candle<br>to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.<br>“Damn the child!” he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again<br>to see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.<br>The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket,<br>and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed<br>brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. “It’s a flush<br>of fever,” thought Svidrigaïlov. It was like the flush from drinking, as<br>though she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were<br>hot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long<br>black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a<br>sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little<br>girl were not asleep, but pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in<br>a smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to<br>control them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,<br>a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite<br>unchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the<br>shameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they<br>turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited<br>him.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that<br>laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. “What,<br>at five years old?” Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror. “What does<br>it mean?” And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding<br>out her arms.... “Accursed child!” Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand<br>to strike her, but at that moment he woke up.<br><br>He was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not<br>been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.<br><br>“I’ve had nightmare all night!” He got up angrily, feeling utterly<br>shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could<br>see nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up,<br>put on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his<br>pocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his<br>pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few<br>lines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into thought with his<br>elbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some<br>flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on<br>the table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began<br>trying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.<br>At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he<br>started, got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later he<br>was in the street.<br><br>A thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidrigaïlov walked along the<br>slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing<br>the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,<br>the wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the<br>bush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think<br>of something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.<br>The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with<br>their closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and<br>he began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and read<br>each carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and<br>came to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with<br>its tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead<br>drunk, across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high tower<br>stood up on the left. “Bah!” he shouted, “here is a place. Why should<br>it be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witness<br>anyway....”<br><br>He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where<br>there was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates of<br>the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,<br>wrapped in a grey soldier’s coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his<br>head. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. His<br>face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly<br>printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both,<br>Svidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes<br>without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man<br>not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a<br>word.<br><br>“What do you want here?” he said, without moving or changing his<br>position.<br><br>“Nothing, brother, good morning,” answered Svidrigaïlov.<br><br>“This isn’t the place.”<br><br>“I am going to foreign parts, brother.”<br><br>“To foreign parts?”<br><br>“To America.”<br><br>“America.”<br><br>Svidrigaïlov took out the revolver and cocked it. Achilles raised his<br>eyebrows.<br><br>“I say, this is not the place for such jokes!”<br><br>“Why shouldn’t it be the place?”<br><br>“Because it isn’t.”<br><br>“Well, brother, I don’t mind that. It’s a good place. When you are<br>asked, you just say he was going, he said, to America.”<br><br>He put the revolver to his right temple.<br><br>“You can’t do it here, it’s not the place,” cried Achilles, rousing<br>himself, his eyes growing bigger and bigger.<br><br>Svidrigaïlov pulled the trigger.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VII<br><br>The same day, about seven o’clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on<br>his way to his mother’s and sister’s lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyev’s<br>house which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up from<br>the street. Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still<br>hesitating whether to go or not. But nothing would have turned him back:<br>his decision was taken.<br><br>“Besides, it doesn’t matter, they still know nothing,” he thought, “and<br>they are used to thinking of me as eccentric.”<br><br>He was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a<br>night’s rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the<br>inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent all<br>the previous night alone, God knows where. But anyway he had reached a<br>decision.<br><br>He knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. Dounia was not<br>at home. Even the servant happened to be out. At first Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by<br>the hand and drew him into the room.<br><br>“Here you are!” she began, faltering with joy. “Don’t be angry with<br>me, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not<br>crying. Did you think I was crying? No, I am delighted, but I’ve got<br>into such a stupid habit of shedding tears. I’ve been like that ever<br>since your father’s death. I cry for anything. Sit down, dear boy, you<br>must be tired; I see you are. Ah, how muddy you are.”<br><br>“I was in the rain yesterday, mother....” Raskolnikov began.<br><br>“No, no,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly interrupted, “you thought I<br>was going to cross-question you in the womanish way I used to; don’t be<br>anxious, I understand, I understand it all: now I’ve learned the ways<br>here and truly I see for myself that they are better. I’ve made up my<br>mind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you to<br>give an account of them? God knows what concerns and plans you may have,<br>or what ideas you are hatching; so it’s not for me to keep nudging your<br>elbow, asking you what you are thinking about? But, my goodness! why<br>am I running to and fro as though I were crazy...? I am reading your<br>article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitch<br>brought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: ‘There,<br>foolish one,’ I thought, ‘that’s what he is busy about; that’s the<br>solution of the mystery! Learned people are always like that. He may<br>have some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I<br>worry him and upset him.’ I read it, my dear, and of course there was a<br>great deal I did not understand; but that’s only natural--how should I?”<br><br>“Show me, mother.”<br><br>Raskolnikov took the magazine and glanced at his article. Incongruous<br>as it was with his mood and his circumstances, he felt that strange and<br>bitter sweet sensation that every author experiences the first time he<br>sees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three. It lasted only<br>a moment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed<br>with anguish. He recalled all the inward conflict of the preceding<br>months. He flung the article on the table with disgust and anger.<br><br>“But, however foolish I may be, Rodya, I can see for myself that you<br>will very soon be one of the leading--if not the leading man--in the<br>world of Russian thought. And they dared to think you were mad! You<br>don’t know, but they really thought that. Ah, the despicable creatures,<br>how could they understand genius! And Dounia, Dounia was all but<br>believing it--what do you say to that? Your father sent twice to<br>magazines--the first time poems (I’ve got the manuscript and will show<br>you) and the second time a whole novel (I begged him to let me copy it<br>out) and how we prayed that they should be taken--they weren’t! I was<br>breaking my heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your<br>clothes and the way you are living. But now I see again how foolish<br>I was, for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and<br>talent. No doubt you don’t care about that for the present and you are<br>occupied with much more important matters....”<br><br>“Dounia’s not at home, mother?”<br><br>“No, Rodya. I often don’t see her; she leaves me alone. Dmitri<br>Prokofitch comes to see me, it’s so good of him, and he always talks<br>about you. He loves you and respects you, my dear. I don’t say that<br>Dounia is very wanting in consideration. I am not complaining. She has<br>her ways and I have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and<br>I never have any secrets from you two. Of course, I am sure that Dounia<br>has far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me... but I don’t<br>know what it will all lead to. You’ve made me so happy by coming now,<br>Rodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in I’ll tell<br>her: ‘Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you been all<br>this time?’ You mustn’t spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you can,<br>but if you can’t, it doesn’t matter, I can wait. I shall know, anyway,<br>that you are fond of me, that will be enough for me. I shall read what<br>you write, I shall hear about you from everyone, and sometimes you’ll<br>come yourself to see me. What could be better? Here you’ve come now to<br>comfort your mother, I see that.”<br><br>Here Pulcheria Alexandrovna began to cry.<br><br>“Here I am again! Don’t mind my foolishness. My goodness, why am I<br>sitting here?” she cried, jumping up. “There is coffee and I don’t offer<br>you any. Ah, that’s the selfishness of old age. I’ll get it at once!”<br><br>“Mother, don’t trouble, I am going at once. I haven’t come for that.<br>Please listen to me.”<br><br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.<br><br>“Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are<br>told about me, will you always love me as you do now?” he asked suddenly<br>from the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words and<br>not weighing them.<br><br>“Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter? How can you ask me such a question?<br>Why, who will tell me anything about you? Besides, I shouldn’t believe<br>anyone, I should refuse to listen.”<br><br>“I’ve come to assure you that I’ve always loved you and I am glad<br>that we are alone, even glad Dounia is out,” he went on with the same<br>impulse. “I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you<br>must believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all<br>you thought about me, that I was cruel and didn’t care about you, was<br>all a mistake. I shall never cease to love you.... Well, that’s enough:<br>I thought I must do this and begin with this....”<br><br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna embraced him in silence, pressing him to her<br>bosom and weeping gently.<br><br>“I don’t know what is wrong with you, Rodya,” she said at last. “I’ve<br>been thinking all this time that we were simply boring you and now I see<br>that there is a great sorrow in store for you, and that’s why you are<br>miserable. I’ve foreseen it a long time, Rodya. Forgive me for speaking<br>about it. I keep thinking about it and lie awake at nights. Your sister<br>lay talking in her sleep all last night, talking of nothing but you. I<br>caught something, but I couldn’t make it out. I felt all the morning<br>as though I were going to be hanged, waiting for something, expecting<br>something, and now it has come! Rodya, Rodya, where are you going? You<br>are going away somewhere?”<br><br>“Yes.”<br><br>“That’s what I thought! I can come with you, you know, if you need<br>me. And Dounia, too; she loves you, she loves you dearly--and Sofya<br>Semyonovna may come with us if you like. You see, I am glad to look upon<br>her as a daughter even... Dmitri Prokofitch will help us to go together.<br>But... where... are you going?”<br><br>“Good-bye, mother.”<br><br>“What, to-day?” she cried, as though losing him for ever.<br><br>“I can’t stay, I must go now....”<br><br>“And can’t I come with you?”<br><br>“No, but kneel down and pray to God for me. Your prayer perhaps will<br>reach Him.”<br><br>“Let me bless you and sign you with the cross. That’s right, that’s<br>right. Oh, God, what are we doing?”<br><br>Yes, he was glad, he was very glad that there was no one there, that<br>he was alone with his mother. For the first time after all those awful<br>months his heart was softened. He fell down before her, he kissed her<br>feet and both wept, embracing. And she was not surprised and did not<br>question him this time. For some days she had realised that something<br>awful was happening to her son and that now some terrible minute had<br>come for him.<br><br>“Rodya, my darling, my first born,” she said sobbing, “now you are just<br>as when you were little. You would run like this to me and hug me and<br>kiss me. When your father was living and we were poor, you comforted us<br>simply by being with us and when I buried your father, how often we<br>wept together at his grave and embraced, as now. And if I’ve been crying<br>lately, it’s that my mother’s heart had a foreboding of trouble. The<br>first time I saw you, that evening, you remember, as soon as we arrived<br>here, I guessed simply from your eyes. My heart sank at once, and to-day<br>when I opened the door and looked at you, I thought the fatal hour had<br>come. Rodya, Rodya, you are not going away to-day?”<br><br>“No!”<br><br>“You’ll come again?”<br><br>“Yes... I’ll come.”<br><br>“Rodya, don’t be angry, I don’t dare to question you. I know I mustn’t.<br>Only say two words to me--is it far where you are going?”<br><br>“Very far.”<br><br>“What is awaiting you there? Some post or career for you?”<br><br>“What God sends... only pray for me.” Raskolnikov went to the door, but<br>she clutched him and gazed despairingly into his eyes. Her face worked<br>with terror.<br><br>“Enough, mother,” said Raskolnikov, deeply regretting that he had come.<br><br>“Not for ever, it’s not yet for ever? You’ll come, you’ll come<br>to-morrow?”<br><br>“I will, I will, good-bye.” He tore himself away at last.<br><br>It was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning.<br>Raskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste. He wanted to finish all<br>before sunset. He did not want to meet anyone till then. Going up the<br>stairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him<br>intently. “Can anyone have come to see me?” he wondered. He had a<br>disgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his door he saw Dounia. She<br>was sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she had<br>been waiting a long time. He stopped short in the doorway. She rose from<br>the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him. Her eyes, fixed upon him,<br>betrayed horror and infinite grief. And from those eyes alone he saw at<br>once that she knew.<br><br>“Am I to come in or go away?” he asked uncertainly.<br><br>“I’ve been all day with Sofya Semyonovna. We were both waiting for you.<br>We thought that you would be sure to come there.”<br><br>Raskolnikov went into the room and sank exhausted on a chair.<br><br>“I feel weak, Dounia, I am very tired; and I should have liked at this<br>moment to be able to control myself.”<br><br>He glanced at her mistrustfully.<br><br>“Where were you all night?”<br><br>“I don’t remember clearly. You see, sister, I wanted to make up my mind<br>once for all, and several times I walked by the Neva, I remember that<br>I wanted to end it all there, but... I couldn’t make up my mind,” he<br>whispered, looking at her mistrustfully again.<br><br>“Thank God! That was just what we were afraid of, Sofya Semyonovna and<br>I. Then you still have faith in life? Thank God, thank God!”<br><br>Raskolnikov smiled bitterly.<br><br>“I haven’t faith, but I have just been weeping in mother’s arms; I<br>haven’t faith, but I have just asked her to pray for me. I don’t know<br>how it is, Dounia, I don’t understand it.”<br><br>“Have you been at mother’s? Have you told her?” cried Dounia,<br>horror-stricken. “Surely you haven’t done that?”<br><br>“No, I didn’t tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal.<br>She heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure she half understands it<br>already. Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her. I don’t know why I did<br>go. I am a contemptible person, Dounia.”<br><br>“A contemptible person, but ready to face suffering! You are, aren’t<br>you?”<br><br>“Yes, I am going. At once. Yes, to escape the disgrace I thought of<br>drowning myself, Dounia, but as I looked into the water, I thought that<br>if I had considered myself strong till now I’d better not be afraid of<br>disgrace,” he said, hurrying on. “It’s pride, Dounia.”<br><br>“Pride, Rodya.”<br><br>There was a gleam of fire in his lustreless eyes; he seemed to be glad<br>to think that he was still proud.<br><br>“You don’t think, sister, that I was simply afraid of the water?” he<br>asked, looking into her face with a sinister smile.<br><br>“Oh, Rodya, hush!” cried Dounia bitterly. Silence lasted for two<br>minutes. He sat with his eyes fixed on the floor; Dounia stood at the<br>other end of the table and looked at him with anguish. Suddenly he got<br>up.<br><br>“It’s late, it’s time to go! I am going at once to give myself up. But I<br>don’t know why I am going to give myself up.”<br><br>Big tears fell down her cheeks.<br><br>“You are crying, sister, but can you hold out your hand to me?”<br><br>“You doubted it?”<br><br>She threw her arms round him.<br><br>“Aren’t you half expiating your crime by facing the suffering?” she<br>cried, holding him close and kissing him.<br><br>“Crime? What crime?” he cried in sudden fury. “That I killed a vile<br>noxious insect, an old pawnbroker woman, of use to no one!... Killing<br>her was atonement for forty sins. She was sucking the life out of poor<br>people. Was that a crime? I am not thinking of it and I am not thinking<br>of expiating it, and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? ‘A<br>crime! a crime!’ Only now I see clearly the imbecility of my cowardice,<br>now that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace. It’s simply<br>because I am contemptible and have nothing in me that I have decided to,<br>perhaps too for my advantage, as that... Porfiry... suggested!”<br><br>“Brother, brother, what are you saying? Why, you have shed blood?” cried<br>Dounia in despair.<br><br>“Which all men shed,” he put in almost frantically, “which flows and has<br>always flowed in streams, which is spilt like champagne, and for which<br>men are crowned in the Capitol and are called afterwards benefactors of<br>mankind. Look into it more carefully and understand it! I too wanted to<br>do good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds<br>to make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply<br>clumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now<br>that it has failed.... (Everything seems stupid when it fails.) By that<br>stupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position, to<br>take the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have<br>been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison.... But I...<br>I couldn’t carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible,<br>that’s what’s the matter! And yet I won’t look at it as you do. If I had<br>succeeded I should have been crowned with glory, but now I’m trapped.”<br><br>“But that’s not so, not so! Brother, what are you saying?”<br><br>“Ah, it’s not picturesque, not æsthetically attractive! I fail to<br>understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable.<br>The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence. I’ve never,<br>never recognised this more clearly than now, and I am further than ever<br>from seeing that what I did was a crime. I’ve never, never been stronger<br>and more convinced than now.”<br><br>The colour had rushed into his pale exhausted face, but as he uttered<br>his last explanation, he happened to meet Dounia’s eyes and he saw such<br>anguish in them that he could not help being checked. He felt that he<br>had, anyway, made these two poor women miserable, that he was, anyway,<br>the cause...<br><br>“Dounia darling, if I am guilty forgive me (though I cannot be forgiven<br>if I am guilty). Good-bye! We won’t dispute. It’s time, high time to go.<br>Don’t follow me, I beseech you, I have somewhere else to go.... But you<br>go at once and sit with mother. I entreat you to! It’s my last request<br>of you. Don’t leave her at all; I left her in a state of anxiety, that<br>she is not fit to bear; she will die or go out of her mind. Be with<br>her! Razumihin will be with you. I’ve been talking to him.... Don’t cry<br>about me: I’ll try to be honest and manly all my life, even if I am a<br>murderer. Perhaps I shall some day make a name. I won’t disgrace you,<br>you will see; I’ll still show.... Now good-bye for the present,” he<br>concluded hurriedly, noticing again a strange expression in Dounia’s<br>eyes at his last words and promises. “Why are you crying? Don’t cry,<br>don’t cry: we are not parting for ever! Ah, yes! Wait a minute, I’d<br>forgotten!”<br><br>He went to the table, took up a thick dusty book, opened it and took<br>from between the pages a little water-colour portrait on ivory. It was<br>the portrait of his landlady’s daughter, who had died of fever, that<br>strange girl who had wanted to be a nun. For a minute he gazed at the<br>delicate expressive face of his betrothed, kissed the portrait and gave<br>it to Dounia.<br><br>“I used to talk a great deal about it to her, only to her,” he said<br>thoughtfully. “To her heart I confided much of what has since been so<br>hideously realised. Don’t be uneasy,” he returned to Dounia, “she was<br>as much opposed to it as you, and I am glad that she is gone. The great<br>point is that everything now is going to be different, is going to<br>be broken in two,” he cried, suddenly returning to his dejection.<br>“Everything, everything, and am I prepared for it? Do I want it myself?<br>They say it is necessary for me to suffer! What’s the object of these<br>senseless sufferings? shall I know any better what they are for, when I<br>am crushed by hardships and idiocy, and weak as an old man after twenty<br>years’ penal servitude? And what shall I have to live for then? Why am I<br>consenting to that life now? Oh, I knew I was contemptible when I stood<br>looking at the Neva at daybreak to-day!”<br><br>At last they both went out. It was hard for Dounia, but she loved him.<br>She walked away, but after going fifty paces she turned round to look<br>at him again. He was still in sight. At the corner he too turned and for<br>the last time their eyes met; but noticing that she was looking at him,<br>he motioned her away with impatience and even vexation, and turned the<br>corner abruptly.<br><br>“I am wicked, I see that,” he thought to himself, feeling ashamed a<br>moment later of his angry gesture to Dounia. “But why are they so fond<br>of me if I don’t deserve it? Oh, if only I were alone and no one loved<br>me and I too had never loved anyone! _Nothing of all this would have<br>happened._ But I wonder shall I in those fifteen or twenty years grow so<br>meek that I shall humble myself before people and whimper at every word<br>that I am a criminal? Yes, that’s it, that’s it, that’s what they are<br>sending me there for, that’s what they want. Look at them running to and<br>fro about the streets, every one of them a scoundrel and a criminal at<br>heart and, worse still, an idiot. But try to get me off and they’d be<br>wild with righteous indignation. Oh, how I hate them all!”<br><br>He fell to musing by what process it could come to pass, that he could<br>be humbled before all of them, indiscriminately--humbled by conviction.<br>And yet why not? It must be so. Would not twenty years of continual<br>bondage crush him utterly? Water wears out a stone. And why, why should<br>he live after that? Why should he go now when he knew that it would be<br>so? It was the hundredth time perhaps that he had asked himself that<br>question since the previous evening, but still he went.<br><br><br><br>CHAPTER VIII<br><br>When he went into Sonia’s room, it was already getting dark. All day<br>Sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been<br>waiting with her. She had come to her that morning, remembering<br>Svidrigaïlov’s words that Sonia knew. We will not describe the<br>conversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became.<br>Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her<br>brother would not be alone. He had gone to her, Sonia, first with his<br>confession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it;<br>she would go with him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask,<br>but she knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and<br>at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost on the point<br>of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at<br>Dounia. Dounia’s gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively<br>and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room had<br>remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.<br><br>Dounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her<br>brother’s room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come<br>there first. When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread<br>of his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent<br>the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both<br>were less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, each<br>thought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to<br>her the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives--Siberia or...<br>Besides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.<br><br>“Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to<br>make him live?” she thought at last in despair.<br><br>Meanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection, looking<br>intently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the<br>unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began to<br>feel sure of his death--he walked into the room.<br><br>She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned<br>pale.<br><br>“Yes,” said Raskolnikov, smiling. “I have come for your cross, Sonia. It<br>was you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened<br>now it’s come to that?”<br><br>Sonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a cold<br>shiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the<br>words were a mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid<br>meeting her eyes.<br><br>“You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. There is one<br>fact.... But it’s a long story and there’s no need to discuss it. But<br>do you know what angers me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish<br>faces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid<br>questions, which I shall have to answer--they’ll point their fingers at<br>me.... Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. I’d<br>rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise<br>him, what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I’ve become<br>too irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my<br>sister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me. It’s<br>a brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are the<br>crosses?”<br><br>He seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still or<br>concentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after<br>one another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.<br><br>Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress<br>wood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and<br>over him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.<br><br>“It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,” he laughed. “As though I<br>had not suffered much till now! The wooden cross, that is the peasant<br>one; the copper one, that is Lizaveta’s--you will wear yourself, show<br>me! So she had it on... at that moment? I remember two things like<br>these too, a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old<br>woman’s neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I<br>ought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what<br>matters; I’m somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you,<br>Sonia, so that you might know... that’s all--that’s all I came for. But<br>I thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I<br>am going to prison and you’ll have your wish. Well, what are you crying<br>for? You too? Don’t. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!”<br><br>But his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. “Why<br>is she grieving too?” he thought to himself. “What am I to her? Why does<br>she weep? Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll<br>be my nurse.”<br><br>“Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,” Sonia begged in a timid<br>broken voice.<br><br>“Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely....”<br><br>But he wanted to say something quite different.<br><br>He crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her shawl and put<br>it over her head. It was the green _drap de dames_ shawl of which<br>Marmeladov had spoken, “the family shawl.” Raskolnikov thought of that<br>looking at it, but he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he<br>was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He was<br>frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia<br>meant to go with him.<br><br>“What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I’ll go<br>alone,” he cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he moved<br>towards the door. “What’s the use of going in procession?” he muttered<br>going out.<br><br>Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even said<br>good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubt<br>surged in his heart.<br><br>“Was it right, was it right, all this?” he thought again as he went down<br>the stairs. “Couldn’t he stop and retract it all... and not go?”<br><br>But still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn’t ask<br>himself questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that he<br>had not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of<br>the room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted<br>at her, and he stopped short for a moment. At the same instant, another<br>thought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike<br>him then.<br><br>“Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told her--on<br>business; on what business? I had no sort of business! To tell her I was<br>_going_; but where was the need? Do I love her? No, no, I drove her away<br>just now like a dog. Did I want her crosses? Oh, how low I’ve sunk! No,<br>I wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart<br>ached! I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some<br>friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what<br>I would do! I am a beggarly contemptible wretch, contemptible!”<br><br>He walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go. But<br>on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it<br>went to the Hay Market.<br><br>He looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and<br>could not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. “In<br>another week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this<br>bridge, how shall I look at the canal then? I should like to remember<br>this!” slipped into his mind. “Look at this sign! How shall I read those<br>letters then? It’s written here ‘Campany,’ that’s a thing to remember,<br>that letter _a_, and to look at it again in a month--how shall I look<br>at it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial<br>it all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be<br>interesting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I am<br>becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? Foo! how<br>people shove! that fat man--a German he must be--who pushed against<br>me, does he know whom he pushed? There’s a peasant woman with a baby,<br>begging. It’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might<br>give her something, for the incongruity of it. Here’s a five copeck<br>piece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here... take it, my<br>good woman!”<br><br>“God bless you,” the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice.<br><br>He went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very distasteful to be<br>in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people. He would have<br>given anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he<br>would not have remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and<br>disorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. There<br>was a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd,<br>stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short<br>jerky laugh. A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him,<br>though he still stared. He moved away at last, not remembering where he<br>was; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly<br>came over him, overwhelming him body and mind.<br><br>He suddenly recalled Sonia’s words, “Go to the cross-roads, bow down to<br>the people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say<br>aloud to the whole world, ‘I am a murderer.’” He trembled, remembering<br>that. And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially<br>of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively<br>clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation. It came<br>over him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and<br>spreading fire through him. Everything in him softened at once and the<br>tears started into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot....<br><br>He knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and<br>kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. He got up and bowed<br>down a second time.<br><br>“He’s boozed,” a youth near him observed.<br><br>There was a roar of laughter.<br><br>“He’s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children<br>and his country. He’s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great<br>city of St. Petersburg and its pavement,” added a workman who was a<br>little drunk.<br><br>“Quite a young man, too!” observed a third.<br><br>“And a gentleman,” someone observed soberly.<br><br>“There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t nowadays.”<br><br>These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, “I am<br>a murderer,” which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips,<br>died away. He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking<br>round, he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had a<br>glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt<br>that it must be so. The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he<br>saw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding<br>from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She had<br>followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at that moment felt<br>and knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow<br>him to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him. It wrung his<br>heart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.<br><br>He went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the third<br>storey. “I shall be some time going up,” he thought. He felt as though<br>the fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time<br>left for consideration.<br><br>Again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral<br>stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and<br>the same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not been<br>here since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, but<br>still they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, to<br>collect himself, so as to enter _like a man_. “But why? what for?” he<br>wondered, reflecting. “If I must drink the cup what difference does it<br>make? The more revolting the better.” He imagined for an instant the<br>figure of the “explosive lieutenant,” Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually<br>going to him? Couldn’t he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch?<br>Couldn’t he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings?<br>At least then it would be done privately.... No, no! To the “explosive<br>lieutenant”! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.<br><br>Turning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office.<br>There were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a<br>peasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.<br>Raskolnikov walked into the next room. “Perhaps I still need not speak,”<br> passed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was<br>settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was<br>seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.<br><br>“No one in?” Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau.<br><br>“Whom do you want?”<br><br>“A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the<br>Russian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... I’ve forgotten! ‘At<br>your service!’” a familiar voice cried suddenly.<br><br>Raskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him. He<br>had just come in from the third room. “It is the hand of fate,” thought<br>Raskolnikov. “Why is he here?”<br><br>“You’ve come to see us? What about?” cried Ilya Petrovitch. He<br>was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle<br>exhilarated. “If it’s on business you are rather early.[*] It’s only a<br>chance that I am here... however I’ll do what I can. I must admit, I...<br>what is it, what is it? Excuse me....”<br><br>     [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after<br>     sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the<br>     police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for<br>     coming too late.--TRANSLATOR.<br><br>“Raskolnikov.”<br><br>“Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn’t imagine I’d forgotten? Don’t think I<br>am like that... Rodion Ro--Ro--Rodionovitch, that’s it, isn’t it?”<br><br>“Rodion Romanovitch.”<br><br>“Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just getting at it. I<br>made many inquiries about you. I assure you I’ve been genuinely grieved<br>since that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to me<br>afterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and<br>so to say the first steps... Mercy on us! What literary or scientific<br>man does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and I have<br>the greatest respect for literature, in my wife it’s a genuine passion!<br>Literature and art! If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be<br>gained by talents, learning, good sense, genius. As for a hat--well,<br>what does a hat matter? I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but<br>what’s under the hat, what the hat covers, I can’t buy that! I was even<br>meaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you’d... But I<br>am forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really? I hear your<br>family have come?”<br><br>“Yes, my mother and sister.”<br><br>“I’ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister--a highly<br>cultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry I got so hot with<br>you. There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting<br>fit--that affair has been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism!<br>I understand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging on<br>account of your family’s arriving?”<br><br>“No, I only looked in... I came to ask... I thought that I should find<br>Zametov here.”<br><br>“Oh, yes! Of course, you’ve made friends, I heard. Well, no, Zametov is<br>not here. Yes, we’ve lost Zametov. He’s not been here since yesterday...<br>he quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way. He is a<br>feather-headed youngster, that’s all; one might have expected something<br>from him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men.<br>He wanted to go in for some examination, but it’s only to talk and<br>boast about it, it will go no further than that. Of course it’s a very<br>different matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there, your friend. Your<br>career is an intellectual one and you won’t be deterred by failure. For<br>you, one may say, all the attractions of life _nihil est_--you are an<br>ascetic, a monk, a hermit!... A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned<br>research--that’s where your spirit soars! I am the same way myself....<br>Have you read Livingstone’s Travels?”<br><br>“No.”<br><br>“Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know,<br>and indeed it is not to be wondered at. What sort of days are they? I<br>ask you. But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer me<br>openly, openly!”<br><br>“N-no...”<br><br>“Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself!<br>Official duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to say<br>_friendship_ is quite another? No, you’re wrong! It’s not friendship,<br>but the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and of<br>love for the Almighty. I may be an official, but I am always bound<br>to feel myself a man and a citizen.... You were asking about Zametov.<br>Zametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad<br>reputation, over a glass of champagne... that’s all your Zametov is good<br>for! While I’m perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and lofty<br>feelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post! I am married and<br>have children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who is<br>he, may I ask? I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Then<br>these midwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous.”<br><br>Raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words of Ilya<br>Petrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for the most part a<br>stream of empty sounds for him. But some of them he understood. He<br>looked at him inquiringly, not knowing how it would end.<br><br>“I mean those crop-headed wenches,” the talkative Ilya Petrovitch<br>continued. “Midwives is my name for them. I think it a very satisfactory<br>one, ha-ha! They go to the Academy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am<br>I to send for a young lady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!” Ilya<br>Petrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his own wit. “It’s an immoderate<br>zeal for education, but once you’re educated, that’s enough. Why abuse<br>it? Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does? Why<br>did he insult me, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too, how common<br>they are, you can’t fancy! People spend their last halfpenny and kill<br>themselves, boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard<br>about a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, I say, what<br>was the name of that gentleman who shot himself?”<br><br>“Svidrigaïlov,” someone answered from the other room with drowsy<br>listlessness.<br><br>Raskolnikov started.<br><br>“Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!” he cried.<br><br>“What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?”<br><br>“Yes... I knew him.... He hadn’t been here long.”<br><br>“Yes, that’s so. He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless habits and<br>all of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way.... He left<br>in his notebook a few words: that he dies in full possession of his<br>faculties and that no one is to blame for his death. He had money, they<br>say. How did you come to know him?”<br><br>“I... was acquainted... my sister was governess in his family.”<br><br>“Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something about him. You had<br>no suspicion?”<br><br>“I saw him yesterday... he... was drinking wine; I knew nothing.”<br><br>Raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling<br>him.<br><br>“You’ve turned pale again. It’s so stuffy here...”<br><br>“Yes, I must go,” muttered Raskolnikov. “Excuse my troubling you....”<br><br>“Oh, not at all, as often as you like. It’s a pleasure to see you and I<br>am glad to say so.”<br><br>Ilya Petrovitch held out his hand.<br><br>“I only wanted... I came to see Zametov.”<br><br>“I understand, I understand, and it’s a pleasure to see you.”<br><br>“I... am very glad... good-bye,” Raskolnikov smiled.<br><br>He went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know<br>what he was doing. He began going down the stairs, supporting himself<br>with his right hand against the wall. He fancied that a porter pushed<br>past him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in<br>the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a<br>rolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into the yard.<br>There, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and horror-stricken.<br>She looked wildly at him. He stood still before her. There was a look of<br>poignant agony, of despair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips<br>worked in an ugly, meaningless smile. He stood still a minute, grinned<br>and went back to the police office.<br><br>Ilya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers. Before<br>him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs.<br><br>“Hulloa! Back again! have you left something behind? What’s the matter?”<br><br>Raskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer.<br>He walked right to the table, leaned his hand on it, tried to say<br>something, but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible.<br><br>“You are feeling ill, a chair! Here, sit down! Some water!”<br><br>Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes fixed on the<br>face of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed unpleasant surprise. Both<br>looked at one another for a minute and waited. Water was brought.<br><br>“It was I...” began Raskolnikov.<br><br>“Drink some water.”<br><br>Raskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly and brokenly,<br>but distinctly said:<br><br>“_It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with<br>an axe and robbed them._”<br><br>Ilya Petrovitch opened his mouth. People ran up on all sides.<br><br>Raskolnikov repeated his statement.<br><br><br><br>EPILOGUE<br><br>I<br><br>Siberia. On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town, one of<br>the administrative centres of Russia; in the town there is a fortress,<br>in the fortress there is a prison. In the prison the second-class<br>convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months. Almost a<br>year and a half has passed since his crime.<br><br>There had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered<br>exactly, firmly, and clearly to his statement. He did not confuse nor<br>misrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit<br>the smallest detail. He explained every incident of the murder, the<br>secret of _the pledge_ (the piece of wood with a strip of metal) which<br>was found in the murdered woman’s hand. He described minutely how he<br>had taken her keys, what they were like, as well as the chest and its<br>contents; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta’s murder; described how<br>Koch and, after him, the student knocked, and repeated all they had said<br>to one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay<br>and Dmitri shouting; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards<br>gone home. He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the<br>Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found.<br>The whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the<br>judges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he<br>had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making<br>use of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the<br>trinkets were like, or even how many there were. The fact that he had<br>never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed<br>incredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and<br>seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone,<br>some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the<br>damp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man<br>should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made<br>a truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyers<br>more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really<br>not looked into the purse, and so didn’t know what was in it when he<br>hid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that<br>the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental<br>derangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of<br>gain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary<br>insanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases. Moreover<br>Raskolnikov’s hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by<br>Dr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.<br>All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not<br>quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another<br>element in the case.<br><br>To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the<br>criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question<br>as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he<br>answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was<br>his miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to<br>provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand<br>roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder<br>through his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by<br>privation and failure. To the question what led him to confess, he<br>answered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost<br>coarse....<br><br>The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,<br>perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,<br>but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange<br>and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.<br>There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition<br>of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he<br>had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his<br>abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the<br>murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man<br>commits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally, the<br>confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by<br>the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism,<br>and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no<br>suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did<br>much to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner’s<br>favour came out quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered and<br>proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor<br>consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting<br>him for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit<br>old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,<br>Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral<br>when he died. Raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that when they<br>had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two<br>little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This was<br>investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts<br>made an impression in his favour.<br><br>And in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating<br>circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a<br>term of eight years only.<br><br>At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s mother fell ill. Dounia<br>and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the<br>trial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so<br>as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time<br>to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s<br>illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial<br>derangement of her intellect.<br><br>When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she<br>had found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium. That evening<br>Razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother’s<br>questions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her<br>mother’s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia<br>on a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and<br>reputation.<br><br>But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never<br>asked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter. On the<br>contrary, she had her own version of her son’s sudden departure; she<br>told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting<br>that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya<br>had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be<br>in hiding. As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be<br>brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. She assured<br>Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his<br>article and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was<br>continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed<br>with her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was<br>obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken<br>her suspicions.<br><br>They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s strange<br>silence on certain subjects. She did not, for instance, complain of<br>getting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived<br>on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of<br>great uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother<br>suspected that there was something terrible in her son’s fate and was<br>afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. In any<br>case, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of<br>her faculties.<br><br>It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave<br>such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her<br>without mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and<br>suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood<br>lasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive<br>her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely<br>silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that<br>the poor mother suspected something terrible. Dounia remembered her<br>brother’s telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her<br>sleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the<br>fatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?<br>Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be<br>succeeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would<br>begin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his<br>future.... Her fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured her,<br>pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending),<br>but she still went on talking.<br><br>Five months after Raskolnikov’s confession, he was sentenced. Razumihin<br>and Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible. At last<br>the moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her brother that the<br>separation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in<br>his youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least<br>of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving<br>up a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every<br>natural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital. There<br>they would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would<br>begin a new life. They all wept at parting.<br><br>Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. He asked a great<br>deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her. He worried<br>so much about her that it alarmed Dounia. When he heard about his<br>mother’s illness he became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularly<br>reserved all the time. With the help of the money left to her by<br>Svidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the<br>party of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia. Not a word<br>passed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it<br>would be so. At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his<br>sister’s and Razumihin’s fervent anticipations of their happy future<br>together when he should come out of prison. He predicted that their<br>mother’s illness would soon have a fatal ending. Sonia and he at last<br>set off.<br><br>Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin. It was a quiet and<br>sorrowful wedding; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however.<br>During all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.<br>Dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she<br>could not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength of will.<br>Among other things he began attending university lectures again in order<br>to take his degree. They were continually making plans for the future;<br>both counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least. Till<br>then they rested their hopes on Sonia.<br><br>Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia’s<br>marriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more<br>melancholy and anxious. To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how<br>Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father<br>and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two<br>little children from a fire. These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria<br>Alexandrovna’s disordered imagination almost to ecstasy. She was<br>continually talking about them, even entering into conversation with<br>strangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her. In public<br>conveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she would<br>begin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped the<br>student, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on! Dounia did<br>not know how to restrain her. Apart from the danger of her morbid<br>excitement, there was the risk of someone’s recalling Raskolnikov’s name<br>and speaking of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the<br>address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted<br>on going to see her.<br><br>At last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She would sometimes<br>begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. One<br>morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home,<br>that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must<br>expect him back in nine months. She began to prepare for his coming,<br>began to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and<br>put up new hangings and so on. Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and<br>helped her to arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual<br>fancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was<br>taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.<br>It was brain fever. She died within a fortnight. In her delirium she<br>dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her<br>son’s terrible fate than they had supposed.<br><br>For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother’s death, though<br>a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached<br>Siberia. It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month<br>to the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. At<br>first they found Sonia’s letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on<br>they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for<br>from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate<br>brother’s life. Sonia’s letters were full of the most matter-of-fact<br>detail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov’s<br>surroundings as a convict. There was no word of her own hopes, no<br>conjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings. Instead of<br>any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the<br>simple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health,<br>what he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her<br>and so on. All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness. The<br>picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness<br>and precision. There could be no mistake, because nothing was given but<br>facts.<br><br>But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news,<br>especially at first. Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not<br>ready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave<br>him from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and<br>that when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last<br>of her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly<br>affected by it, not externally at any rate. She told them that, although<br>he seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off<br>from everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life;<br>that he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time,<br>had no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely<br>seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything he<br>had known before. She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his<br>work without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent<br>about food, but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that<br>at last he had been glad to accept some money from her, Sonia, to have<br>his own tea every day. He begged her not to trouble about anything else,<br>declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him. Sonia wrote<br>further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she<br>had not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were<br>crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a<br>rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But that<br>he lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply<br>from inattention and indifference.<br><br>Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,<br>had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and<br>rude to her. But that in the end these visits had become a habit and<br>almost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when<br>she was ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see him<br>on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he was<br>brought for a few minutes to see her. On working days she would go to<br>see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns, or at the<br>sheds on the banks of the Irtish.<br><br>About herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some<br>acquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as there<br>was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an<br>indispensable person in many houses. But she did not mention that the<br>authorities were, through her, interested in Raskolnikov; that his task<br>was lightened and so on.<br><br>At last the news came (Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and<br>uneasiness in the preceding letters) that he held aloof from everyone,<br>that his fellow prisoners did not like him, that he kept silent for days<br>at a time and was becoming very pale. In the last letter Sonia wrote<br>that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of<br>the hospital.<br><br><br><br>II<br><br>He was ill a long time. But it was not the horrors of prison life, not<br>the hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes<br>that crushed him. What did he care for all those trials and hardships!<br>he was even glad of the hard work. Physically exhausted, he could at<br>least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food to<br>him--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In the past as a<br>student he had often not had even that. His clothes were warm and suited<br>to his manner of life. He did not even feel the fetters. Was he ashamed<br>of his shaven head and parti-coloured coat? Before whom? Before Sonia?<br>Sonia was afraid of him, how could he be ashamed before her? And yet he<br>was ashamed even before Sonia, whom he tortured because of it with<br>his contemptuous rough manner. But it was not his shaven head and his<br>fetters he was ashamed of: his pride had been stung to the quick. It was<br>wounded pride that made him ill. Oh, how happy he would have been if he<br>could have blamed himself! He could have borne anything then, even<br>shame and disgrace. But he judged himself severely, and his exasperated<br>conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except<br>a simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone. He was ashamed just<br>because he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief<br>through some decree of blind fate, and must humble himself and submit to<br>“the idiocy” of a sentence, if he were anyhow to be at peace.<br><br>Vague and objectless anxiety in the present, and in the future a<br>continual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay before<br>him. And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he<br>would only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life! What had he to<br>live for? What had he to look forward to? Why should he strive? To live<br>in order to exist? Why, he had been ready a thousand times before to<br>give up existence for the sake of an idea, for a hope, even for a fancy.<br>Mere existence had always been too little for him; he had always wanted<br>more. Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he<br>had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others.<br><br>And if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that<br>would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep, that repentance, the<br>awful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning! Oh, he would<br>have been glad of it! Tears and agonies would at least have been life.<br>But he did not repent of his crime.<br><br>At least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity, as he<br>had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison.<br>But now in prison, _in freedom_, he thought over and criticised all his<br>actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque<br>as they had seemed at the fatal time.<br><br>“In what way,” he asked himself, “was my theory stupider than others<br>that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world? One has<br>only to look at the thing quite independently, broadly, and uninfluenced<br>by commonplace ideas, and my idea will by no means seem so... strange.<br>Oh, sceptics and halfpenny philosophers, why do you halt half-way!<br><br>“Why does my action strike them as so horrible?” he said to himself. “Is<br>it because it was a crime? What is meant by crime? My conscience is at<br>rest. Of course, it was a legal crime, of course, the letter of the law<br>was broken and blood was shed. Well, punish me for the letter of the<br>law... and that’s enough. Of course, in that case many of the<br>benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of<br>inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps. But<br>those men succeeded and so _they were right_, and I didn’t, and so I<br>had no right to have taken that step.”<br><br>It was only in that that he recognised his criminality, only in the fact<br>that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it.<br><br>He suffered too from the question: why had he not killed himself? Why<br>had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess? Was the<br>desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it? Had not<br>Svidrigaïlov overcome it, although he was afraid of death?<br><br>In misery he asked himself this question, and could not understand that,<br>at the very time he had been standing looking into the river, he had<br>perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and<br>his convictions. He didn’t understand that that consciousness might be<br>the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future<br>resurrection.<br><br>He preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he<br>could not step over, again through weakness and meanness. He looked at<br>his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and<br>prized it. It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in<br>prison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some of<br>them, the tramps for instance, had endured! Could they care so much for<br>a ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away<br>in some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and<br>longed to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the<br>green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush? As he went on he<br>saw still more inexplicable examples.<br><br>In prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not see and did not<br>want to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes. It was loathsome<br>and unbearable for him to look. But in the end there was much that<br>surprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much<br>that he had not suspected before. What surprised him most of all was<br>the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. They<br>seemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at<br>him with distrust and hostility. He felt and knew the reasons of his<br>isolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons<br>were so deep and strong. There were some Polish exiles, political<br>prisoners, among them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as<br>ignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.<br>He saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the<br>Poles. There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a former<br>officer and two seminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.<br>He was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at<br>last--why, he could not tell. Men who had been far more guilty despised<br>and laughed at his crime.<br><br>“You’re a gentleman,” they used to say. “You shouldn’t hack about with<br>an axe; that’s not a gentleman’s work.”<br><br>The second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his<br>gang. He went to church and prayed with the others. A quarrel broke out<br>one day, he did not know how. All fell on him at once in a fury.<br><br>“You’re an infidel! You don’t believe in God,” they shouted. “You ought<br>to be killed.”<br><br>He had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted to<br>kill him as an infidel. He said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at<br>him in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently;<br>his eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch. The guard<br>succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant, or there would<br>have been bloodshed.<br><br>There was another question he could not decide: why were they all so<br>fond of Sonia? She did not try to win their favour; she rarely met<br>them, sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment. And yet<br>everybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow _him_,<br>knew how and where she lived. She never gave them money, did them no<br>particular services. Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents<br>of pies and rolls. But by degrees closer relations sprang up between<br>them and Sonia. She would write and post letters for them to their<br>relations. Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their<br>instructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives<br>and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her. And when she visited<br>Raskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they<br>all took off their hats to her. “Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, you<br>are our dear, good little mother,” coarse branded criminals said to that<br>frail little creature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone was<br>delighted when she smiled. They even admired her gait and turned round<br>to watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in<br>fact, did not know what to admire her most for. They even came to her<br>for help in their illnesses.<br><br>He was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter. When<br>he was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish<br>and delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a<br>terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of<br>Asia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts<br>of microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were<br>endowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once<br>mad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual<br>and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never<br>had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their<br>moral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples<br>went mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand<br>one another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched<br>looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung<br>his hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to<br>consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom<br>to justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They<br>gathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march<br>the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken<br>and the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting<br>and devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in<br>the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was<br>summoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned,<br>because everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they<br>could not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreed<br>on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something<br>quite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another,<br>fought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All<br>men and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and<br>moved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole<br>world. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and<br>a new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these<br>men, no one had heard their words and their voices.<br><br>Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so<br>miserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.<br>The second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring<br>days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel<br>paced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during<br>his illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was<br>difficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially<br>in the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the<br>windows of the ward.<br><br>One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. On<br>waking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the<br>distance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone.<br>Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and<br>moved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day<br>after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was<br>discharged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that<br>Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.<br><br>He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that<br>her illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about her,<br>Sonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better,<br>that she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and<br>see him at his work. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.<br><br>Again it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six o’clock, he<br>went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster<br>and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only<br>three of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the<br>fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and<br>laying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river<br>bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the<br>wide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before<br>him, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.<br>In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black<br>specks, the nomads’ tents. There there was freedom, there other men were<br>living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand<br>still, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed.<br>Raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into<br>contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited<br>and troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up<br>noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the<br>morning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the<br>green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and<br>paler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand<br>with her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand<br>to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would<br>repel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always<br>seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout<br>her visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply<br>grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance<br>at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were<br>alone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.<br><br>How it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to<br>seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round<br>her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she<br>turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same<br>moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her<br>eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and<br>that at last the moment had come....<br><br>They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They<br>were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the<br>dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were<br>renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the<br>heart of the other.<br><br>They resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years to<br>wait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before<br>them! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his<br>being, while she--she only lived in his life.<br><br>On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked,<br>Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied<br>that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him<br>differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered<br>him in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought it was bound<br>to be so. Wasn’t everything now bound to be changed?<br><br>He thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her<br>and wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face.<br>But these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what<br>infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings. And what were all,<br>_all_ the agonies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence<br>and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an<br>external, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not<br>think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have<br>analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped<br>into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself<br>out in his mind.<br><br>Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically.<br>The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the<br>raising of Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry<br>him about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with<br>books. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject<br>and had not even offered him the Testament. He had asked her for it<br>himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without<br>a word. Till now he had not opened it.<br><br>He did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: “Can<br>her convictions not be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations at<br>least....”<br><br>She too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken<br>ill again. But she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she was<br>almost frightened of her happiness. Seven years, _only_ seven years! At<br>the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready<br>to look on those seven years as though they were seven days. He did not<br>know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would<br>have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great<br>suffering.<br><br>But that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual<br>renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing<br>from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.<br>That might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is<br>ended.<br><br><br><br><br><br>End of Project Gutenberg’s Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevsky<br><br>*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CRIME AND PUNISHMENT ***<br><br>***** This file should be named 2554-0.txt or 2554-0.zip *****<br>This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:<br>        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/5/5/2554/<br><br>Produced by John Bickers; and Dagny and David Widger<br><br>Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions<br>will be renamed.<br><br>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no<br>one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation<br>(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without<br>permission and without paying copyright royalties.
