            <p>My heart goes out to people who have hurting hearts.
              Equipped by the Lord  Jesus Christ, I have served in outdoors ministry, mental health/alcohol and  other drug counseling,
              hospital and hospice chaplaincy as well as specializing  in grief support as a bereavement coordinator. <br/>
              World missions is one of my passions.
              I have been involved in short term mission trips to Slovakia Republic and Mexico.
              My prayer is for the Lord Jesus to bless my blog to reach broken hearts around the world. Voice of the Martyrs 
              will receive 10% of all earnings from Leaving Grief at Heaven's Gate. <br/>
              My blog will be updated weekly with a link to my current and upcoming books on healing grief through God's grace as
              well as my website offering phone grief  support services. Leaving Grief at Heaven's Gate is dedicated to Jesus our 
              Savior as a means for you to receive His Word for healing your broken heart. <br/>
              <br/>
              <br/>
              What I believe: <br/>
              I believe the Holy Bible is the inspired word of God without error. <br/>
              I believe in God the Father creator of Heaven and Earth. <br/>
              I believe in Jesus Christ His only begotten son who died and rose again from  the dead for the salvation of all the world. <br/>
              I believe in the gift of the Holy Spirit. <br/>
              I believe we are in the last days and time is of essence to bring in the harvest. <br/>
              I believe the Father's will is for you to be healed from grief by His gift of grace. <br/>
